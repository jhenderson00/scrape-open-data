The primary goal of publishing this dataset is to provide users timely information about local disease spread and reporting of positive cases. The data will be updated daily, reflecting tests completed by 12:00 am (midnight) the day of the update (i.e., all tests reported by the end of the day on the day before the update).\n\n<b>Note</b>: On November 14, 2020, only 14 hours of laboratory data was collected and shared. A 2:00 pm cutoff time was implemented, allowing the NYSDOH to enhance data quality reviews. All other published laboratory data represented 24 hours of data collection.\n\nAs of April 4, 2022, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) no longer requires entities conducting COVID testing to report negative or indeterminate antigen test results. This may impact the number and interpretation of total test results reported to the state and also impacts calculation of test percent positivity. Because of this, as of April 5, 2022, test percent positivity is calculated using PCR tests only. Reporting of total new daily cases (positive results) will continue to include PCR and antigen tests.\n\nReporting of SARS-CoV2 laboratory testing results is mandated under Part 2 of the New York State Sanitary Code. Clinical laboratories, as defined in Public Health Law (PHL) \u00a7 571 electronically report test results to the New York State Department of Health (DOH) via the Electronic Clinical Laboratory Reporting System (ECLRS). The DOH Division of Epidemiology\u2019s Bureau of Surveillance and Data System (BSDS) monitors ECLRS reporting and ensures that all positives and negatives are accurate. Starting September 30, 2020, this data also includes pooled/batch tests reported by institutions of higher education. This is also known as surveillance testing and not performed by a clinical laboratory. \n\nTest counts reflect those reported to DOH each day. A person may have multiple specimens tested on one day, these would be counted one time, i.e., if two specimens are collected from an individual at the same time and then evaluated, the outcome of the evaluation of those two samples to diagnose the individual is counted as a single test of one person, even though the specimens may be tested separately. Conversely, if an individual is tested on more than one day, the data will show two tests of an individual, one for each date the person was tested. An individual will only be counted positive one time. \n\nTest counts are assigned to a county based on this order of preference: 1) the patient\u2019s address, 2) the ordering healthcare provider/campus address, or 3) the ordering facility/campus address.", "attribution": "New York State Department of Health", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-09-01T16:19:43.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-03-29T16:57:56.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-09-01T16:19:43.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-08-31T18:01:50.000Z", "columns_name": ["County", "Test Date", "New Positives", "Test % Positive", "Geography", "Cumulative Number of Tests Performed", "Total Number of Tests Performed", "Cumulative Number of Positives"], "columns_field_name": ["county", "test_date", "new_positives", "test_positive", "geography", "cumulative_number_of_tests", "total_number_of_tests", "cumulative_number_of_positives"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["The county of residence for the person tested.", "The date the test result was processed by the NYS Electronic Clinical Laboratory Reporting System (ECLRS).", "The number of new persons tested positive for COVID-19 infection on the test date in each county.", "For the dates before 4/4/2022: The percentage of all COVID tests reported to NYSDOH that are positive.

The primary goal of publishing this dataset is to provide users with information about healthcare facility fatalities among patients with lab-confirmed COVID-19 disease. \n\nThe information in this dataset is also updated daily on the NYS COVID-19 Tracker at https://www.ny.gov/covid-19tracker.\n\nThe data source for this dataset is the daily COVID-19 survey through the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) Health Electronic Response Data System (HERDS). Hospitals, nursing homes, and adult care facilities are required to complete this survey daily. The information from the survey is used for statewide surveillance, planning, resource allocation, and emergency response activities. Hospitals began reporting for the HERDS COVID-19 survey in March 2020, while Nursing Homes and Adult Care Facilities began reporting in April 2020. It is important to note that fatalities related to COVID-19 disease that occurred prior to the first publication dates are also included. \n\nThe fatality numbers in this dataset are calculated by summing the patient fatalities by patient sex, as of each reporting date. The statewide total fatality numbers are calculated by summing the number of fatalities across all patient sexes, by reporting date. The fatality percentages are calculated by dividing the number of fatalities in each patient sex by the statewide total number of fatalities, by reporting date.

A health tracking indicator is a metric through which progress on a certain area of health improvement can be assessed.  The indicators are organized by the Priority Area of the Prevention Agenda as well as the Focus Area under each Priority Area. The data sets also include indicators about major cross-cutting health outcomes and about health disparities.

Both changes were piloted and evaluated for three years prior to implementation in 2011, and were found to improve the representativeness of the BRFSS sample. However, these changes in the methodology were found to have a significant impact on rates calculated from BRFSS data. Consequently, BRFSS data prior to 2011 should not be directly compared to data from 2011 forward. As a result of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the BRFSS definition of disability was modified from being based on 2 questions (\u201cAre you limited in any way in any activities because of physical, mental, or emotional problems?\u201d and \u201cDo you now have any health problem that requires you to use special equipment, such as a cane, a wheelchair, a special bed, or a special telephone?\u201d) to 6 questions (\u201cAre you deaf or do you have serious difficulty hearing?\u201d, \u201d Are you blind or do you have serious difficulty seeing, even when wearing glasses?\u201d, \u201dBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions?\u201d, \u201dDo you have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs?\u201d, \u201dDo you have difficulty dressing or bathing?\u201d, and \u201dBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor\u2019s office or shopping?\u201d).  Data collection for this new definition of disability was initiated on the BRFSS in 2016.  Prior data that was based on the 2-question definition, has been renamed as \u201cLimitation status\u201d, and has been preserved in this table through 2017. Beginning in 2015, New York State modified the sampling methodology for the BRFSS survey to support calculation of rates at a regional level.  These regions are defined based on Medicaid\u2019s Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) program.  A crosswalk from the 62 New York State counties to the DSRIP regions can be found in the Data Dictionary documentation for these tables."}, {"key": "Disclaimers_Limitations", "value": "1)  Data are sample-based, and therefore have sampling error and potential non-sampling error. 95% confidence errors are provided to indicate the degree of sampling error. 2)\tData are self-reported, and therefore are subject to respondents\u2019 misunderstanding of questions, personal biases, nonresponse, etc."}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "health.data.ny.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://health.data.ny.gov/d/4kmw-8mvn", "link": "https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Health-Care-Coverage-Status-BRFSS-2007-2010/4kmw-8mvn", "owner": {"id": "s9j2-nqmr", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Open Data NY - DOH"}, "creator": {"id": "s9j2-nqmr", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Open Data NY - DOH"}}

It is unknown how many influenza patients do not seek medical care, are not tested by a reliable assay, or are tested in settings that do not report results to ECLRS.

However, it is not known how influenza testing practices or the proportion of all tests being performed in clinical laboratory settings have changed over time or how they vary geographically. Thus, caution should be used when comparing data such as absolute numbers of cases between seasons or counties. Despite these limitations, the data can provide useful situational awareness (e.g., trend) information during an influenza season. Data may also be used to compare epidemic characteristics, e.g., timing or proportion of virus types, between seasons. However, comparing absolute numbers of cases between seasons should be approached with caution, as noted above. Also, because the onset of influenza activity varies annually, caution should be used when comparing a single week\u2019s data (or season-to-date data) to the corresponding week(s) in previous seasons as a measure of relative activity.

The SWSCR dataset includes weight status data collected from all public school districts outside of the five boroughs of NYC. The dataset is a valid source of information about variation in overweight and obesity in public school districts outside of New York City. However, because these rates reflect a broad range of factors that vary by school district, to make absolute comparisons about observed differences in the rates of obesity and overweight between school districts requires the use of multivariate statistics.  Data are aggregated to New York State Department of Education county code assigned to reporting schools and school districts, and to NYSDOH regions and statewide.  Because school district boundaries do not align with county or regional boundaries, the county and regional-level estimates reflect data from students attending school within schools assigned a particular county or regional code. County and regional assignment is not based on county or region of residence. The estimates represent the percentage of students reported within a weight status category, which reflects data reported to the Student Weight Status Category Reporting System. These data should not be considered to represent all school aged-children attending school in a district, county or region because of restrictions in reporting due to FERPA, especially parents'/guardians' ability to request that their child's weight status data be excluded from reporting and other sources of missing data.  Use the school years variable to distinguish between the full file (which spans 2 years and includes all public school districts) and the single-year, district only file (which spans a single year and includes only the approximately 50% of public school districts that reported during that year).

Therefore the percentage of the student population represented in the district, county and regional-level estimates may vary. New York City school districts are exempt from the NYS Education Law 903 and 904 that established the SWSCR system. Therefore this dataset excludes public school districts from the five boroughs of New York City (Brooklyn, Kings, New York, Queens, and Richmond).

Both changes were piloted and evaluated for three years prior to implementation in 2011, and were found to improve the representativeness of the BRFSS sample. However, these changes in the methodology were found to have a significant impact on rates calculated from BRFSS data. Consequently, BRFSS data prior to 2011 should not be directly compared to data from 2011 forward. As a result of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the BRFSS definition of disability was modified from being based on 2 questions (\u201cAre you limited in any way in any activities because of physical, mental, or emotional problems?\u201d and \u201cDo you now have any health problem that requires you to use special equipment, such as a cane, a wheelchair, a special bed, or a special telephone?\u201d) to 6 questions (\u201cAre you deaf or do you have serious difficulty hearing?\u201d, \u201d Are you blind or do you have serious difficulty seeing, even when wearing glasses?\u201d, \u201dBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions?\u201d, \u201dDo you have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs?\u201d, \u201dDo you have difficulty dressing or bathing?\u201d, and \u201dBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor\u2019s office or shopping?\u201d).  Data collection for this new definition of disability was initiated on the BRFSS in 2016.  Prior data that was based on the 2-question definition, has been renamed as \u201cLimitation status\u201d, and has been preserved in this table through 2017. Beginning in 2015, New York State modified the sampling methodology for the BRFSS survey to support calculation of rates at a regional level.

It is unknown how many influenza patients do not seek medical care, are not tested by a reliable assay, or are tested in settings that do not report results to ECLRS. Further, certain tests such as RIDTs have limited accuracy; false negative and false positive results do occur.   The number of laboratories reporting data to ECLRS has increased over time. However, it is not known how influenza testing practices or the proportion of all tests being performed in clinical laboratory settings have changed over time or how they vary geographically. Thus, caution should be used when comparing data such as absolute numbers of cases between seasons or counties.   Despite these limitations, the data can provide useful situational awareness (e.g., trend) information during an influenza season. Data may also be used to compare epidemic characteristics, e.g., timing or proportion of virus types, between seasons. However, comparing absolute numbers of cases between seasons should be approached with caution, as noted above.  Also, because the onset of influenza activity varies annually, caution should be used when comparing a single week\u2019s data (or season-to-date data) to the corresponding week(s) in previous seasons as a measure of relative activity.  The number of cases reported is only one measure of influenza\u2019s impact; information on illness severity cannot be derived from the case counts."}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "health.data.ny.gov"}, "permalink": "https://health.data.ny.gov/d/jr8b-6gh6", "link": "https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Influenza-Laboratory-Confirmed-Cases-by-County-Beg/jr8b-6gh6", "owner": {"id": "s9j2-nqmr", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Open Data NY - DOH"}, "creator": {"id": "s9j2-nqmr", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Open Data NY - DOH"}}

The primary goal of publishing this dataset is to provide users timely information about local disease spread and reporting of positive cases. The data will be updated daily, reflecting tests reported by 12:00 am (midnight) three days prior.  Data are published on a three-day lag in order to allow all test results to be reported.\n\nReporting of SARS-CoV2 laboratory testing results is mandated under Part 2 of the New York State Sanitary Code. Clinical laboratories, as defined in Public Health Law (PHL) \u00a7 571 electronically report test results to the New York State Department of Health (DOH) via the Electronic Clinical Laboratory Reporting System (ECLRS). The DOH Division of Epidemiology\u2019s Bureau of Surveillance and Data System (BSDS) monitors ECLRS reporting and ensures that all results are accurate. \n\nTest counts are based on specimen collection date.  A person may have multiple specimens tested on one day, these would be counted one time, i.e., if two specimens are collected from an individual at the same time and then evaluated, the outcome of the evaluation of those two samples to diagnose the individual is counted as a single test of one person, even though the specimens may be tested separately.  All positive test results that are at least 90 days apart are counted as cases/new positives.\n\nNew positive test counts are assigned to a county based on this order of preference: 1) the patient\u2019s address, 2) the ordering healthcare provider/campus address, or 3) the ordering facility/campus address.\n\nArchived versions of the reinfections dataset are also available:\nFirst infections - https://health.data.ny.gov/d/xdss-u53e\nReinfections - https://health.data.ny.gov/d/7aaj-cdtu", "attribution": "New York State Department of Health", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-01-10T19:01:27.000Z", "createdAt": "2023-08-10T17:08:12.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-01-10T19:01:20.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-01-10T19:01:27.000Z", "columns_name": ["Geography Description", "Total New Positives", "Cases Per 100k Antigen", "Cases Per 100k PCR", "Total Cases Per 100k (7-day avg)", "Total Cases Per 100k", "Geography Level", "New Positives Antigen", "Test Date", "New Positives PCR"], "columns_field_name": ["geography_description", "total_new_positives", "cases_per_100k_antigen", "cases_per_100k_pcr", "total_cases_per_100k_7_day", "total_cases_per_100k", "geography_level", "new_positives_antigen", "test_date", "new_positives_pcr"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number"], "columns_description": ["The county or region of residence for the person tested.", "The number of new positive tests for COVID-19 infection on the test date in each county.", "The rate of new positive antigen tests per hundred thousand people.

The primary goal of publishing this dataset is to provide users with timely information about hospitalizations among patients with lab-confirmed COVID-19 disease.\n\nThe data source for this dataset is the daily COVID-19 survey through the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) Health Electronic Response Data System (HERDS). Hospitals are required to complete this survey daily and data reflects the number of patients hospitalized and number of patients in the ICU reported by hospitals through the survey each day. These data include NYS resident and non-NYS resident hospitalizations.

The primary goal of publishing this dataset is to provide users timely information about local disease spread and reporting of positive cases. The data will be updated daily, reflecting tests completed by 12:00 am (midnight) the day of the update (i.e., all tests reported by the end of the day on the day before the update).\n\n<b>Note</b>: On November 14, 2020, only 14 hours of laboratory data was collected and shared. A 2:00 pm cutoff time was implemented, allowing the NYSDOH to enhance data quality reviews. All other published laboratory data represented 24 hours of data collection.\n\nAs of April 4, 2022, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) no longer requires entities conducting COVID testing to report negative or indeterminate antigen test results. This may impact the number and interpretation of total test results reported to the state and also impacts calculation of test percent positivity. Because of this, as of April 5, 2022, test percent positivity is calculated using PCR tests only. Reporting of total new daily cases (positive results) will continue to include PCR and antigen tests.\n\nReporting of SARS-CoV2 laboratory testing results is mandated under Part 2 of the New York State Sanitary Code. Clinical laboratories, as defined in Public Health Law (PHL) \u00a7 571 electronically report test results to the New York State Department of Health (DOH) via the Electronic Clinical Laboratory Reporting System (ECLRS). The DOH Division of Epidemiology\u2019s Bureau of Surveillance and Data System (BSDS) monitors ECLRS reporting and ensures that all positives and negatives are accurate. Starting September 30, 2020, this data also includes pooled/batch tests reported by institutions of higher education. This is also known as surveillance testing and not performed by a clinical laboratory. \n\nTest counts reflect those reported to DOH each day. A person may have multiple specimens tested on one day, these would be counted one time, i.e., if two specimens are collected from an individual at the same time and then evaluated, the outcome of the evaluation of those two samples to diagnose the individual is counted as a single test of one person, even though the specimens may be tested separately. Conversely, if an individual is tested on more than one day, the data will show two tests of an individual, one for each date the person was tested. An individual will only be counted positive one time. \n\nTest counts are assigned to a county based on this order of preference: 1) the patient\u2019s address, 2) the ordering healthcare provider/campus address, or 3) the ordering facility/campus address.", "attribution": "New York State Department of Health", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-09-01T16:19:43.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-03-29T16:57:56.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-09-01T16:19:43.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-08-31T18:01:50.000Z", "columns_name": ["County", "Test Date", "New Positives", "Test % Positive", "Geography", "Cumulative Number of Tests Performed", "Total Number of Tests Performed", "Cumulative Number of Positives"], "columns_field_name": ["county", "test_date", "new_positives", "test_positive", "geography", "cumulative_number_of_tests", "total_number_of_tests", "cumulative_number_of_positives"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["The county of residence for the person tested.", "The date the test result was processed by the NYS Electronic Clinical Laboratory Reporting System (ECLRS).", "The number of new persons tested positive for COVID-19 infection on the test date in each county.", "For the dates before 4/4/2022: The percentage of all COVID tests reported to NYSDOH that are positive.
