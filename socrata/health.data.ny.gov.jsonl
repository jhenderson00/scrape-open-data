Both changes were piloted and evaluated for three years prior to implementation in 2011, and were found to improve the representativeness of the BRFSS sample.

As a result of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the BRFSS definition of disability was modified from being based on 2 questions (\u201cAre you limited in any way in any activities because of physical, mental, or emotional problems?\u201d and \u201cDo you now have any health problem that requires you to use special equipment, such as a cane, a wheelchair, a special bed, or a special telephone?\u201d) to 6 questions (\u201cAre you deaf or do you have serious difficulty hearing?\u201d, \u201d Are you blind or do you have serious difficulty seeing, even when wearing glasses?\u201d, \u201dBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions?\u201d, \u201dDo you have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs?\u201d, \u201dDo you have difficulty dressing or bathing?\u201d, and \u201dBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor\u2019s office or shopping?\u201d).  Data collection for this new definition of disability was initiated on the BRFSS in 2016.  Prior data that was based on the 2-question definition, has been renamed as \u201cLimitation status\u201d, and has been preserved in this table through 2017.

This dataset does not include fatalities related to COVID-19 disease that did not occur at a hospital, nursing home, or adult care facility. The primary goal of publishing this dataset is to provide users with information about healthcare facility fatalities among patients with lab-confirmed COVID-19 disease. \r\n\r\nThe information in this dataset is also updated daily on the NYS COVID-19 Tracker at https://www.ny.gov/covid-19tracker.\r\n\r\nThe data source for this dataset is the daily COVID-19 survey through the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) Health Electronic Response Data System (HERDS). Hospitals, nursing homes, and adult care facilities are required to complete this survey daily. The information from the survey is used for statewide surveillance, planning, resource allocation, and emergency response activities. Hospitals began reporting for the HERDS COVID-19 survey in March 2020, while Nursing Homes and Adult Care Facilities began reporting in April 2020. It is important to note that fatalities related to COVID-19 disease that occurred prior to the first publication dates are also included. \r\n\r\nThe fatality numbers in this dataset are calculated by assigning age groups to each patient based on the patient age, then summing the patient fatalities within each age group, as of each reporting date.

The SWSCR dataset includes weight status data collected from all public school districts outside of the five boroughs of NYC. The dataset is a valid source of information about variation in overweight and obesity in public school districts outside of New York City. However, because these rates reflect a broad range of factors that vary by school district, to make absolute comparisons about observed differences in the rates of obesity and overweight between school districts requires the use of multivariate statistics.  Data are aggregated to New York State Department of Education county code assigned to reporting schools and school districts, and to NYSDOH regions and statewide.  Because school district boundaries do not align with county or regional boundaries, the county and regional-level estimates reflect data from students attending school within schools assigned a particular county or regional code. County and regional assignment is not based on county or region of residence. The estimates represent the percentage of students reported within a weight status category, which reflects data reported to the Student Weight Status Category Reporting System. These data should not be considered to represent all school aged-children attending school in a district, county or region because of restrictions in reporting due to FERPA, especially parents'/guardians' ability to request that their child's weight status data be excluded from reporting and other sources of missing data.

New York City school districts are exempt from the NYS Education Law 903 and 904 that established the SWSCR system. Therefore this dataset excludes public school districts from the five boroughs of New York City (Brooklyn, Kings, New York, Queens, and Richmond).

Both changes were piloted and evaluated for three years prior to implementation in 2011, and were found to improve the representativeness of the BRFSS sample. However, these changes in the methodology were found to have a significant impact on rates calculated from BRFSS data. Consequently, BRFSS data prior to 2011 should not be directly compared to data from 2011 forward. As a result of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the BRFSS definition of disability was modified from being based on 2 questions (\u201cAre you limited in any way in any activities because of physical, mental, or emotional problems?\u201d and \u201cDo you now have any health problem that requires you to use special equipment, such as a cane, a wheelchair, a special bed, or a special telephone?\u201d) to 6 questions (\u201cAre you deaf or do you have serious difficulty hearing?\u201d, \u201d Are you blind or do you have serious difficulty seeing, even when wearing glasses?\u201d, \u201dBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions?\u201d, \u201dDo you have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs?\u201d, \u201dDo you have difficulty dressing or bathing?\u201d, and \u201dBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor\u2019s office or shopping?\u201d).  Data collection for this new definition of disability was initiated on the BRFSS in 2016.  Prior data that was based on the 2-question definition, has been renamed as \u201cLimitation status\u201d, and has been preserved in this table through 2017.

Thus, caution should be used when comparing data such as absolute numbers of cases between seasons or counties.   Despite these limitations, the data can provide useful situational awareness (e.g., trend) information during an influenza season. Data may also be used to compare epidemic characteristics, e.g., timing or proportion of virus types, between seasons. However, comparing absolute numbers of cases between seasons should be approached with caution, as noted above.  Also, because the onset of influenza activity varies annually, caution should be used when comparing a single week\u2019s data (or season-to-date data) to the corresponding week(s) in previous seasons as a measure of relative activity.

The primary goal of publishing this dataset is to provide users timely information about local disease spread and reporting of positive cases. The data will be updated daily, reflecting tests completed by 12:00 am (midnight) the day of the update (i.e., all tests reported by the end of the day on the day before the update).\n<p>\n<b>Note</b>: On November 14, 2020, only 14 hours of laboratory data was collected and shared. A 2:00 pm cutoff time was implemented, allowing the NYSDOH to enhance data quality reviews. All other published laboratory data represented 24 hours of data collection.\n</p><p>\n\n<p>\n<b>As of 4/4/22, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) no longer requires entities conducting COVID testing to report negative or indeterminate antigen test results. This may impact the number and interpretation of total test results reported to the state and also impacts calculation of test percent positivity. Because of this, as of 4/5/22, test percent positivity is calculated using PCR tests only. Reporting of total new daily cases (positive results) will continue to include PCR and antigen tests.</p><p>\n\nReporting of SARS-CoV2 laboratory testing results is mandated under Part 2 of the New York State Sanitary Code. Clinical laboratories, as defined in Public Health Law (PHL) \u00a7 571 electronically report test results to the New York State Department of Health (DOH) via the Electronic Clinical Laboratory Reporting System (ECLRS). The DOH Division of Epidemiology\u2019s Bureau of Surveillance and Data System (BSDS) monitors ECLRS reporting and ensures that all positives and negatives are accurate. Starting September 30, 2020, this data also includes pooled/batch tests reported by institutions of higher education. This is also known as surveillance testing and not performed by a clinical laboratory. \n</p><p>\nTest counts reflect those reported to DOH each day.
