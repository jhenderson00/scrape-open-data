Data may also be used to compare epidemic characteristics, e.g., timing or proportion of virus types, between seasons.

Both changes were piloted and evaluated for three years prior to implementation in 2011, and were found to improve the representativeness of the BRFSS sample.

As a result of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the BRFSS definition of disability was modified from being based on 2 questions (\u201cAre you limited in any way in any activities because of physical, mental, or emotional problems?\u201d and \u201cDo you now have any health problem that requires you to use special equipment, such as a cane, a wheelchair, a special bed, or a special telephone?\u201d) to 6 questions (\u201cAre you deaf or do you have serious difficulty hearing?\u201d, \u201d Are you blind or do you have serious difficulty seeing, even when wearing glasses?\u201d, \u201dBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions?\u201d, \u201dDo you have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs?\u201d, \u201dDo you have difficulty dressing or bathing?\u201d, and \u201dBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor\u2019s office or shopping?\u201d).  Data collection for this new definition of disability was initiated on the BRFSS in 2016.  Prior data that was based on the 2-question definition, has been renamed as \u201cLimitation status\u201d, and has been preserved in this table through 2017.

Both changes were piloted and evaluated for three years prior to implementation in 2011, and were found to improve the representativeness of the BRFSS sample. However, these changes in the methodology were found to have a significant impact on rates calculated from BRFSS data. Consequently, BRFSS data prior to 2011 should not be directly compared to data from 2011 forward. As a result of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the BRFSS definition of disability was modified from being based on 2 questions (\u201cAre you limited in any way in any activities because of physical, mental, or emotional problems?\u201d and \u201cDo you now have any health problem that requires you to use special equipment, such as a cane, a wheelchair, a special bed, or a special telephone?\u201d) to 6 questions (\u201cAre you deaf or do you have serious difficulty hearing?\u201d, \u201d Are you blind or do you have serious difficulty seeing, even when wearing glasses?\u201d, \u201dBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions?\u201d, \u201dDo you have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs?\u201d, \u201dDo you have difficulty dressing or bathing?\u201d, and \u201dBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor\u2019s office or shopping?\u201d).  Data collection for this new definition of disability was initiated on the BRFSS in 2016.  Prior data that was based on the 2-question definition, has been renamed as \u201cLimitation status\u201d, and has been preserved in this table through 2017.

This may impact the number and interpretation of total test results reported to the state and also impacts calculation of test percent positivity. Because of this, as of 4/5/22, test percent positivity is calculated using PCR tests only. Reporting of total new daily cases (positive results) will continue to include PCR and antigen tests.</p><p>\n\nReporting of SARS-CoV2 laboratory testing results is mandated under Part 2 of the New York State Sanitary Code. Clinical laboratories, as defined in Public Health Law (PHL) \u00a7 571 electronically report test results to the New York State Department of Health (DOH) via the Electronic Clinical Laboratory Reporting System (ECLRS). The DOH Division of Epidemiology\u2019s Bureau of Surveillance and Data System (BSDS) monitors ECLRS reporting and ensures that all positives and negatives are accurate. Starting September 30, 2020, this data also includes pooled/batch tests reported by institutions of higher education. This is also known as surveillance testing and not performed by a clinical laboratory. \n</p><p>\nTest counts reflect those reported to DOH each day. A person may have multiple specimens tested on one day, these would be counted one time, i.e., if two specimens are collected from an individual at the same time and then evaluated, the outcome of the evaluation of those two samples to diagnose the individual is counted as a single test of one person, even though the specimens may be tested separately. Conversely, if an individual is tested on more than one day, the data will show two tests of an individual, one for each date the person was tested. An individual will only be counted positive one time. \n</p><p>\nTest counts are assigned to a county based on this order of preference: 1) the patient\u2019s address, 2) the ordering healthcare provider/campus address, or 3) the ordering facility/campus address.\n</p>", "attribution": "New York State Department of Health", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-03-05T19:01:50.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-03-29T16:57:56.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-03-05T19:01:44.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-03-05T19:01:50.000Z", "columns_name": ["Test Date", "County", "New Positives", "Cumulative Number of Positives", "Total Number of Tests Performed", "Cumulative Number of Tests Performed", "Test % Positive", "Geography"], "columns_field_name": ["test_date", "county", "new_positives", "cumulative_number_of_positives", "total_number_of_tests", "cumulative_number_of_tests", "test_positive", "geography"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["The date the test result was processed by the NYS Electronic Clinical Laboratory Reporting System (ECLRS).", "The county of residence for the person tested.", "The number of new persons tested positive for COVID-19 infection on the test date in each county.", "Running total for the number of persons tested positive for COVID-19 infection in each county as of the test date.", "The number of tests of individuals performed on the test date in each county.

This dataset does not include fatalities related to COVID-19 disease that did not occur at a hospital, nursing home, or adult care facility. The primary goal of publishing this dataset is to provide users with information about healthcare facility fatalities among patients with lab-confirmed COVID-19 disease. \n\nThe information in this dataset is also updated daily on the NYS COVID-19 Tracker at https://www.ny.gov/covid-19tracker.\nThe data source for this dataset is the daily COVID-19 survey through the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) Health Electronic Response Data System (HERDS). Hospitals, nursing homes, and adult care facilities are required to complete this survey daily. The information from the survey is used for statewide surveillance, planning, resource allocation, and emergency response activities. Hospitals began reporting for the HERDS COVID-19 survey in March 2020, while Nursing Homes and Adult Care Facilities began reporting in April 2020. It is important to note that fatalities related to COVID-19 disease that occurred prior to the first publication dates are also included.\n\nThe county fatality numbers in this dataset are calculated by summing the number of fatalities by patient county of residence and reporting date, and patient fatalities that occurred based on the facility county, respectively. The statewide fatality numbers are calculated by summing the number of fatalities across all patient counties of residence, and across all facilities by county, by reporting date, respectively.
