The primary goal of publishing this dataset is to provide users timely information about local disease spread and reporting of positive cases. The data will be updated daily, reflecting tests completed by 12:00 am (midnight) the day of the update (i.e., all tests reported by the end of the day on the day before the update).\n\n<b>Note</b>: On November 14, 2020, only 14 hours of laboratory data was collected and shared. A 2:00 pm cutoff time was implemented, allowing the NYSDOH to enhance data quality reviews. All other published laboratory data represented 24 hours of data collection.\n\nAs of April 4, 2022, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) no longer requires entities conducting COVID testing to report negative or indeterminate antigen test results. This may impact the number and interpretation of total test results reported to the state and also impacts calculation of test percent positivity. Because of this, as of April 5, 2022, test percent positivity is calculated using PCR tests only. Reporting of total new daily cases (positive results) will continue to include PCR and antigen tests.\n\nReporting of SARS-CoV2 laboratory testing results is mandated under Part 2 of the New York State Sanitary Code. Clinical laboratories, as defined in Public Health Law (PHL) \u00a7 571 electronically report test results to the New York State Department of Health (DOH) via the Electronic Clinical Laboratory Reporting System (ECLRS). The DOH Division of Epidemiology\u2019s Bureau of Surveillance and Data System (BSDS) monitors ECLRS reporting and ensures that all positives and negatives are accurate. Starting September 30, 2020, this data also includes pooled/batch tests reported by institutions of higher education. This is also known as surveillance testing and not performed by a clinical laboratory. \n\nTest counts reflect those reported to DOH each day. A person may have multiple specimens tested on one day, these would be counted one time, i.e., if two specimens are collected from an individual at the same time and then evaluated, the outcome of the evaluation of those two samples to diagnose the individual is counted as a single test of one person, even though the specimens may be tested separately. Conversely, if an individual is tested on more than one day, the data will show two tests of an individual, one for each date the person was tested. An individual will only be counted positive one time. \n\nTest counts are assigned to a county based on this order of preference: 1) the patient\u2019s address, 2) the ordering healthcare provider/campus address, or 3) the ordering facility/campus address.", "attribution": "New York State Department of Health", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-09-01T16:19:43.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-03-29T16:57:56.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-09-01T16:19:43.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-08-31T18:01:50.000Z", "columns_name": ["Geography", "Cumulative Number of Tests Performed", "Cumulative Number of Positives", "County", "New Positives", "Test % Positive", "Test Date", "Total Number of Tests Performed"], "columns_field_name": ["geography", "cumulative_number_of_tests", "cumulative_number_of_positives", "county", "new_positives", "test_positive", "test_date", "total_number_of_tests"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Calendar date", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Identifies the level of geographical aggregation of a record.

However, it is not known how influenza testing practices or the proportion of all tests being performed in clinical laboratory settings have changed over time or how they vary geographically. Thus, caution should be used when comparing data such as absolute numbers of cases between seasons or counties.   Despite these limitations, the data can provide useful situational awareness (e.g., trend) information during an influenza season. Data may also be used to compare epidemic characteristics, e.g., timing or proportion of virus types, between seasons. However, comparing absolute numbers of cases between seasons should be approached with caution, as noted above.  Also, because the onset of influenza activity varies annually, caution should be used when comparing a single week\u2019s data (or season-to-date data) to the corresponding week(s) in previous seasons as a measure of relative activity.  The number of cases reported is only one measure of influenza\u2019s impact; information on illness severity cannot be derived from the case counts."}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "health.data.ny.gov"}, "permalink": "https://health.data.ny.gov/d/jr8b-6gh6", "link": "https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Influenza-Laboratory-Confirmed-Cases-By-County-Beg/jr8b-6gh6", "owner": {"id": "s9j2-nqmr", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Open Data NY - DOH"}, "creator": {"id": "s9j2-nqmr", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Open Data NY - DOH"}}

Both changes were piloted and evaluated for three years prior to implementation in 2011, and were found to improve the representativeness of the BRFSS sample.

Data collection for this new definition of disability was initiated on the BRFSS in 2016.

Both changes were piloted and evaluated for three years prior to implementation in 2011, and were found to improve the representativeness of the BRFSS sample. However, these changes in the methodology were found to have a significant impact on rates calculated from BRFSS data. Consequently, BRFSS data prior to 2011 should not be directly compared to data from 2011 forward. As a result of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the BRFSS definition of disability was modified from being based on 2 questions (\u201cAre you limited in any way in any activities because of physical, mental, or emotional problems?\u201d and \u201cDo you now have any health problem that requires you to use special equipment, such as a cane, a wheelchair, a special bed, or a special telephone?\u201d) to 6 questions (\u201cAre you deaf or do you have serious difficulty hearing?\u201d, \u201d Are you blind or do you have serious difficulty seeing, even when wearing glasses?\u201d, \u201dBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions?\u201d, \u201dDo you have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs?\u201d, \u201dDo you have difficulty dressing or bathing?\u201d, and \u201dBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor\u2019s office or shopping?\u201d).  Data collection for this new definition of disability was initiated on the BRFSS in 2016.  Prior data that was based on the 2-question definition, has been renamed as \u201cLimitation status\u201d, and has been preserved in this table through 2017. Beginning in 2015, New York State modified the sampling methodology for the BRFSS survey to support calculation of rates at a regional level.
