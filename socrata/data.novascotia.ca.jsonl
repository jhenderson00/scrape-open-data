This dataset includes data from the Current branch of the program. Data from the Water Quality and Wave branches of the program are also available on the Nova Scotia Open Data Portal. CMAR has worked with the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture (NSDFA) and marine service providers to measure ocean current at various locations in Nova Scotia since 2007. The data is collected with Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) deployed on the seafloor. An ADCP is a hydroacoustic current meter that measures water velocities over a range of depths. These sensors measure soundwaves scattered back from moving particles in the water column and use the Doppler effect to estimate speed and direction.  Current data is organized by county. Each county dataset includes data from multiple ADCP deployments that vary in instrument make, model, configuration, capability, and installation location. These characteristics should be taken into consideration when analyzing the data. The \u201cNova Scotia Current Data: Deployment Information\u201d dataset (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/rs2e-ekha) summarises the specifications of each deployment. Individual deployments are identified in the county dataset and metadata by a unique ID in the deployment_id column.   The county datasets are large and can exceed the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the waterbody, station, and/or deployment_id of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/364r-tvmi).   Current data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Current Data: Deployment Information\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/rs2e-ekha). Summary reports for each county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/coastal-monitoring-program/). Data collection and retrieval are ongoing. Some data are excluded from the final dataset during quality control processes. Data have been trimmed of side-lobe interference. The datasets and reports may be revised pending ongoing data collection and analyses. CMAR recommends users apply additional quality control prior to using the data. If you have accessed any of the Current data, CMAR would appreciate your feedback through this quick questionnaire (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3TD6umrsVVKnQL13VVMJIpckCi2ctONJsgN7_g-4c-tKTuw/viewform).

For the writing portion of the assessment, students completed two writing tasks. Student performance in writing was reported for the four components: Ideas, Organization, Language Use and Conventions. Individual student results were reported in four levels: Level 1 (below the expectation), Level 2 (approaching the expectation), Level 3 (at the expectation) Level 4 (above the expectation). Students also received a scaled score in reading (provincial mean = 500, standard deviation = 100, range 200-800). Nova Scotia teachers worked with the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development to build this assessment, score the writing tasks and set the performance expectations in Reading and Writing. The expectation is what students should know and be able to do on their own at the beginning of grade 6.

This dataset includes data from the Current branch of the program. Data from the Water Quality and Wave branches of the program are also available on the Nova Scotia Open Data Portal. CMAR has worked with the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture (NSDFA) and marine service providers to measure ocean current at various locations in Nova Scotia since 2007. The data is collected with Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) deployed on the seafloor. An ADCP is a hydroacoustic current meter that measures water velocities over a range of depths. These sensors measure soundwaves scattered back from moving particles in the water column and use the Doppler effect to estimate speed and direction.  Current data is organized by county. Each county dataset includes data from multiple ADCP deployments that vary in instrument make, model, configuration, capability, and installation location. These characteristics should be taken into consideration when analyzing the data. The \u201cNova Scotia Current Data: Deployment Information\u201d dataset (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/rs2e-ekha) summarises the specifications of each deployment. Individual deployments are identified in the county dataset and metadata by a unique ID in the deployment_id column.   The county datasets are large and can exceed the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the waterbody, station, and/or deployment_id of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/d9vu-mugd).   Current data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Current Data: Deployment Information\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/rs2e-ekha). Summary reports for each county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/coastal-monitoring-program/). Data collection and retrieval are ongoing. Some data are excluded from the final dataset during quality control processes. Data have been trimmed of side-lobe interference. The datasets and reports may be revised pending ongoing data collection and analyses. CMAR recommends users apply additional quality control prior to using the data. If you have accessed any of the Current data, CMAR would appreciate your feedback through this quick questionnaire (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3TD6umrsVVKnQL13VVMJIpckCi2ctONJsgN7_g-4c-tKTuw/viewform).

This dataset includes data from the Current branch of the program. Data from the Water Quality and Wave branches of the program are also available on the Nova Scotia Open Data Portal. CMAR has worked with the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture (NSDFA) and marine service providers to measure ocean current at various locations in Nova Scotia since 2007. The data is collected with Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) deployed on the seafloor. An ADCP is a hydroacoustic current meter that measures water velocities over a range of depths. These sensors measure soundwaves scattered back from moving particles in the water column and use the Doppler effect to estimate speed and direction.  Current data is organized by county. Each county dataset includes data from multiple ADCP deployments that vary in instrument make, model, configuration, capability, and installation location. These characteristics should be taken into consideration when analyzing the data. The \u201cNova Scotia Current Data: Deployment Information\u201d dataset (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/rs2e-ekha) summarises the specifications of each deployment. Individual deployments are identified in the county dataset and metadata by a unique ID in the deployment_id column.   The county datasets are large and can exceed the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the waterbody, station, and/or deployment_id of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/688u-j4en).   Current data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Current Data: Deployment Information\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/rs2e-ekha) Summary reports for each county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/coastal-monitoring-program/).

This program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture in 2012 and CMAR became involved in 2017. CMAR collects water quality data (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and intermittent salinity) using autonomous sensors deployed on \u201csensor strings\u201d. A sensor string typically consists of a line anchored to the sea floor by an acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths below the surface (as measured at low tide). Alternatively, a string may be attached to surface moorings, including floating docks, buoys, and equipment. Sensor strings are deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour. Sensors are retrieved for data offload by triggering the acoustic release when applicable, by directly removing from surface moorings, or occasionally by divers or dragging.  The Coastal Monitoring Program data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the WATERBODY, STATION, DEPTH, VARIABLE, and/or TIMESTAMP of interest before exporting.

The \"Nova Scotia Water Quality Data: Station Locations\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4). Summary reports by county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/reports/). Data can also be downloaded from the ERDAPP server through the Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System (CIOOS) platform (https://catalogue.cioosatlantic.ca/dataset?q=cmar). Data collection and retrieval are ongoing. Some data are excluded from the final dataset during quality control processes. The datasets and reports may be revised pending ongoing data collection and analyses.  A note on units: For Halifax and Lunenburg counties, dissolved oxygen was measured in units of percent saturation or mg/L, depending on the sensor. For all other counties, dissolved oxygen was measured in units of percent saturation. Measurements in mg/L were corrected for salinity using the Garcia-Gordon (1992) salinity correction factor with a salinity value of 30.6 practical salinity units (based on available data for the region). This correction factor is not required for values recorded in percent saturation. Please contact info@cmar.ca for more information.

This program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture in 2012 and CMAR became involved in 2017. CMAR collects water quality data (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and intermittent salinity) using autonomous sensors deployed on \u201csensor strings\u201d. A sensor string typically consists of a line anchored to the sea floor by an acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths below the surface (as measured at low tide). Alternatively, a string may be attached to surface moorings, including floating docks, buoys, and equipment. Sensor strings are deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour. Sensors are retrieved for data offload by triggering the acoustic release when applicable, by directly removing from surface moorings, or occasionally by divers or dragging.  The Coastal Monitoring Program data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the WATERBODY, STATION, DEPTH, VARIABLE, and/or TIMESTAMP of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Lunenburg-County-Water-Quality-Data-Daily-Average-/xg2s-uhbg).   Water Quality Data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Water Quality Data: Station Locations\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4). Summary reports by county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/reports/). Data can also be downloaded from the ERDAPP server through the Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System (CIOOS) platform (https://catalogue.cioosatlantic.ca/dataset?q=cmar). Data collection and retrieval are ongoing. Some data are excluded from the final dataset during quality control processes. The datasets and reports may be revised pending ongoing data collection and analyses.  A note on units: For Halifax and Lunenburg counties, dissolved oxygen was measured in units of percent saturation or mg/L, depending on the sensor. For all other counties, dissolved oxygen was measured in units of percent saturation. Measurements in mg/L were corrected for salinity using the Garcia-Gordon (1992) salinity correction factor with a salinity value of 30.6 practical salinity units (based on available data for the region). This correction factor is not required for values recorded in percent saturation. Please contact info@cmar.ca for more information.

This dataset includes data from the Current branch of the program. Data from the Water Quality and Wave branches of the program are also available on the Nova Scotia Open Data Portal. CMAR has worked with the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture (NSDFA) and marine service providers to measure ocean current at various locations in Nova Scotia since 2007. The data is collected with Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) deployed on the seafloor. An ADCP is a hydroacoustic current meter that measures water velocities over a range of depths. These sensors measure soundwaves scattered back from moving particles in the water column and use the Doppler effect to estimate speed and direction.  Current data is organized by county. Each county dataset includes data from multiple ADCP deployments that vary in instrument make, model, configuration, capability, and installation location. These characteristics should be taken into consideration when analyzing the data. The \u201cNova Scotia Current Data: Deployment Information\u201d dataset (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/rs2e-ekha) summarises the specifications of each deployment. Individual deployments are identified in the county dataset and metadata by a unique ID in the deployment_id column.   The county datasets are large and can exceed the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the waterbody, station, and/or deployment_id of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/wb9p-fqcg).   Current data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Current Data: Deployment Information\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/wb9p-fqcg). Summary reports for each county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/coastal-monitoring-program/). Data collection and retrieval are ongoing. Some data are excluded from the final dataset during quality control processes. Data have been trimmed of side-lobe interference. The datasets and reports may be revised pending ongoing data collection and analyses. CMAR recommends users apply additional quality control prior to using the data. If you have accessed any of the Current data, CMAR would appreciate your feedback through this quick questionnaire (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3TD6umrsVVKnQL13VVMJIpckCi2ctONJsgN7_g-4c-tKTuw/viewform).

This dataset includes data from the Current branch of the program. Data from the Water Quality and Wave branches of the program are also available on the Nova Scotia Open Data Portal. CMAR has worked with the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture (NSDFA) and marine service providers to measure ocean current at various locations in Nova Scotia since 2007. The data is collected with Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) deployed on the seafloor. An ADCP is a hydroacoustic current meter that measures water velocities over a range of depths. These sensors measure soundwaves scattered back from moving particles in the water column and use the Doppler effect to estimate speed and direction.  Current data is organized by county. Each county dataset includes data from multiple ADCP deployments that vary in instrument make, model, configuration, capability, and installation location. These characteristics should be taken into consideration when analyzing the data. The \u201cNova Scotia Current Data: Deployment Information\u201d dataset (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/rs2e-ekha) summarises the specifications of each deployment. Individual deployments are identified in the county dataset and metadata by a unique ID in the deployment_id column.   The county datasets are large and can exceed the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the waterbody, station, and/or deployment_id of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/btag-qamr).   Current data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Current Data: Deployment Information\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/rs2e-ekha). Summary reports for each county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/coastal-monitoring-program/). Data collection and retrieval are ongoing. Some data are excluded from the final dataset during quality control processes. Data have been trimmed of side-lobe interference.

This program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture in 2012 and CMAR became involved in 2017. CMAR collects water quality data (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and intermittent salinity) using autonomous sensors deployed on \u201csensor strings\u201d. A sensor string typically consists of a line anchored to the sea floor by an acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths below the surface (as measured at low tide). Alternatively, a string may be attached to surface moorings, including floating docks, buoys, and equipment. Sensor strings are deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour. Sensors are retrieved for data offload by triggering the acoustic release when applicable, by directly removing from surface moorings, or occasionally by divers or dragging.  The Coastal Monitoring Program data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the WATERBODY, STATION, DEPTH, VARIABLE, and/or TIMESTAMP of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Colchester-County-Water-Quality-Data-Daily-Average/cx5r-jnfx). Water Quality Data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Water Quality Data: Station Locations\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4). Summary reports by county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/reports/). Data can also be downloaded from the ERDAPP server through the Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System (CIOOS) platform (https://catalogue.cioosatlantic.ca/dataset?q=cmar). Data collection and retrieval are ongoing. Some data are excluded from the final dataset during quality control processes. The datasets and reports may be revised pending ongoing data collection and analyses.  A note on units: For Halifax and Lunenburg counties, dissolved oxygen was measured in units of percent saturation or mg/L, depending on the sensor. For all other counties, dissolved oxygen was measured in units of percent saturation. Measurements in mg/L were corrected for salinity using the Garcia-Gordon (1992) salinity correction factor with a salinity value of 30.6 practical salinity units (based on available data for the region). This correction factor is not required for values recorded in percent saturation. Please contact info@cmar.ca for more information.  If you have accessed any of the Coastal Monitoring Program data, CMAR would appreciate your feedback through this quick questionnaire (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3TD6umrsVVKnQL13VVMJIpckCi2ctONJsgN7_g-4c-tKTuw/viewform).

Each individual row of data (Ensemble) from the wind-wave buoys presents wave height (significant, maximum) in metres and average wave direction in degrees relative to true north, corrected for localized magnetic declination specific to the deployment coordinates.

Effective period dates can vary according to collective agreements currently in effect. Most classification effective dates run from April 1 - March 31, however CUPE effective dates run from November 1 - October 31. As contracts are negotiated, pay scales can change, even retroactively. This dataset is re-loaded annually, and may not contain new or retroactive changes resulting from negotiations until the next annual refresh. Refer to published Collective Agreements in these cases.  b) Pay Plan Type is either Excluded (Non-Union) or Bargaining Unit (Union) c) If Pay Plan Level is blank, there are no Pay Plan Levels for the specified Pay Plan d) For a specified Pay Plan and/or Level, there will only be a Bi-weekly or Hourly Pay Rate, not both (one will be blank) e) If you try to expand Hourly Pay Rates to Bi-weekly Amounts or Hourly/Bi-weekly Pay Rates to Annual Amounts, they will be estimates only (factors such as varying work hours and the number of annual pay periods will vary from year to year).

Each individual row of data (Ensemble) from the ADCPs presents wave height (significant, maximum, height average of the top 1/3 & 1/10 largest waves) measured in metres, and period (peak, maximum, period average of the top 1/3 & 1/10 largest waves) measured in seconds. Each individual row of data (Ensemble) from the wind-wave buoys presents wave height (significant, maximum) in metres and average wave direction in degrees relative to true north, corrected for localized magnetic declination specific to the deployment coordinates. The Ensemble Interval (time between averaged measurements) can vary between data sets depending on the configuration of the instrument used for a given deployment. Date and time data are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)."}, {"key": "Detailed-Metadata_Time-Period-Coverage", "value": "2020"}, {"key": "Detailed-Metadata_Language", "value": "eng"}, {"key": "Detailed-Metadata_Frequency", "value": "As needed"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.novascotia.ca", "license": "Nova Scotia Open Government Licence"}, "permalink": "https://data.novascotia.ca/d/hrs3-qwwh", "link": "https://data.novascotia.ca/Fishing-and-Aquaculture/Annapolis-County-Wave-Data/hrs3-qwwh", "owner": {"id": "9pyy-md4w", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Open Data Nova Scotia"}, "creator": {"id": "9pyy-md4w", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Open Data Nova Scotia"}}

For the writing portion of the assessment, students completed two writing tasks. Student performance in writing was reported for the four components: Ideas, Organization, Language Use and Conventions. Individual student results were reported in four levels: Level 1 (below the expectation), Level 2 (approaching the expectation), Level 3 (at the expectation) Level 4 (above the expectation). Students also received a scaled score in reading (provincial mean = 500, standard deviation = 100, range 200-800). Nova Scotia teachers worked with the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development to build this assessment, score the writing tasks and set the performance expectations in Reading and Writing.

This dataset includes data from the Current branch of the program. Data from the Water Quality and Wave branches of the program are also available on the Nova Scotia Open Data Portal. CMAR has worked with the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture (NSDFA) and marine service providers to measure ocean current at various locations in Nova Scotia since 2007. The data is collected with Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) deployed on the seafloor. An ADCP is a hydroacoustic current meter that measures water velocities over a range of depths. These sensors measure soundwaves scattered back from moving particles in the water column and use the Doppler effect to estimate speed and direction.  Current data is organized by county. Each county dataset includes data from multiple ADCP deployments that vary in instrument make, model, configuration, capability, and installation location. These characteristics should be taken into consideration when analyzing the data. The \u201cNova Scotia Current Data: Deployment Information\u201d dataset (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/rs2e-ekha) summarises the specifications of each deployment. Individual deployments are identified in the county dataset and metadata by a unique ID in the deployment_id column.   The county datasets are large and can exceed the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the waterbody, station, and/or deployment_id of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/n5cx-nesf).   Current data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Current Data: Deployment Information\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/rs2e-ekha). Summary reports for each county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/coastal-monitoring-program/). Data collection and retrieval are ongoing. Some data are excluded from the final dataset during quality control processes. Data have been trimmed of side-lobe interference. The datasets and reports may be revised pending ongoing data collection and analyses. CMAR recommends users apply additional quality control prior to using the data. If you have accessed any of the Current data, CMAR would appreciate your feedback through this quick questionnaire (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3TD6umrsVVKnQL13VVMJIpckCi2ctONJsgN7_g-4c-tKTuw/viewform).

Data are extracted from a live database environment and are provisional and subject to change. Some case investigations in recent years remain ongoing. Data here include both confirmed and probable toxicity deaths. Probable drug toxicity deaths will either become confirmed cases once cause of death is certified, or will be determined to not be a toxicity death (death from another cause) and removed from these counts in future data releases. 'All manners' category includes deaths where manner was classified as either accident, suicide, or undetermined. (Acute toxicity deaths are not classified as natural in manner of death, and no toxicity deaths were classified as homicide.) Data reflect cause and manner of death recorded on death certificate. Geocoding of address data has resulted in reclassification of zone of residence for a small number of cases (compared to prior releases of data). Population data have been updated with the most recent available data from Statistics Canada (17-10-0134-01; rate data may differ slightly from previous releases).  Data includes deaths caused by acute toxicity following administration of exogenous substance(s), including pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical drugs and alcohol. Excludes: gases and inhalants, death due to medical consequences of long term substance use, medical assistance in dying, trauma with substances detected but not involved in the mechanism of death. NS totals may be greater than sum of health zones as totals include cases where location of residence was out of province. Totals will also be greater than the sum of accident and suicide where cases remain under investigation and/or manner was certified as 'undetermined'. Data for substances are not mutually exclusive as some deaths are due to toxicity from multiple substances, which may act synergistically to cause death (and may or may not have reached lethal levels alone). As such, counts of deaths by substance cannot be added together for meaningful sums. See the \u2018All substances\u2019 category for overall counts of unique deaths and associated rates.    This dataset includes categories for drug type. Drug-specific data rely on toxicology findings which have a typical lag of 2-8 weeks. Fields are empty when column is not applicable to that data indicator.

This dataset includes data from the Current branch of the program. Data from the Water Quality and Wave branches of the program are also available on the Nova Scotia Open Data Portal. CMAR has worked with the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture (NSDFA) and marine service providers to measure ocean current at various locations in Nova Scotia since 2007. The data is collected with Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) deployed on the seafloor. An ADCP is a hydroacoustic current meter that measures water velocities over a range of depths. These sensors measure soundwaves scattered back from moving particles in the water column and use the Doppler effect to estimate speed and direction.  Current data is organized by county. Each county dataset includes data from multiple ADCP deployments that vary in instrument make, model, configuration, capability, and installation location. These characteristics should be taken into consideration when analyzing the data. The \u201cNova Scotia Current Data: Deployment Information\u201d dataset (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/rs2e-ekha) summarises the specifications of each deployment. Individual deployments are identified in the county dataset and metadata by a unique ID in the deployment_id column.   The county datasets are large and can exceed the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the waterbody, station, and/or deployment_id of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/b4qv-zmqj).   Current data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Current Data: Deployment Information\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/rs2e-ekha). Summary reports for each county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/coastal-monitoring-program/). Data collection and retrieval are ongoing. Some data are excluded from the final dataset during quality control processes. Data have been trimmed of side-lobe interference. The datasets and reports may be revised pending ongoing data collection and analyses. CMAR recommends users apply additional quality control prior to using the data. If you have accessed any of the Current data, CMAR would appreciate your feedback through this quick questionnaire (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3TD6umrsVVKnQL13VVMJIpckCi2ctONJsgN7_g-4c-tKTuw/viewform).

The program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture in the early 1990s. In 2019, CMAR assumed responsibility for the program and expanded its scope and mandate. Through the Water Quality Branch of the program, CMAR collects temperature, dissolved oxygen, and salinity data using sensors deployed on \u201csensor strings\u201d. A sensor string typically consists of a line anchored to the sea floor by an acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths below the surface (as measured at low tide). Alternatively, a string may be attached to surface moorings, including floating docks, buoys, and equipment. Sensor strings are deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour. Sensors are retrieved for data offload by triggering the acoustic release when applicable, by directly removing from surface moorings, or occasionally by divers or grappling methods. Automated Quality Control tests have been applied to the data to identify outlying and unexpected observations. The results of these tests are summarized in the \u201cqc_flag\u201d columns of the dataset. Each data point is assigned a flag value of \u201cPass\u201d, \u201cSuspect/Of Interest\u201d, \u201cFail\u201d, or \u201cNot Evaluated\u201d. Observations flagged as \u201cPass\u201d passed all tests and can be included in analyses. Dissolved oxygen observations flagged as \u201cSuspect/Of Interest\u201d likely indicate biofouling signals and should be excluded from analysis or used with extreme caution. Observations for other variables flagged as \u201cSuspect/Of Interest\u201d should be reviewed before being included in analyses. Observations flagged as \u201cFail\u201d should be excluded from most analyses. Some tests cannot be applied to certain observations, which will be flagged as \u201cNot Evaluated\u201d. These observations can typically be included in analyses. Flags should be used as a guide only, and data users are responsible for evaluating the quality of the data prior to use in any analysis. For more information about the Quality Control tests, visit the CMAR Data Governance website (https://dempsey-cmar.github.io/cmp-data-governance/pages/cmp_about.html). The Coastal Monitoring Program Water Quality data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends filtering the data to the waterbody, station, depth, quality control flag, and/or time period of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/d6fb-k8yz). The \"Nova Scotia Water Quality Data: Station Locations\" dataset on this Portal shows additional locations with available Water Quality data collected through CMAR\u2019s Coastal Monitoring Program (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4). Summary reports by county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/coastal-monitoring-program/). Data can also be downloaded from the ERDAPP server through the Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System (CIOOS) platform (https://catalogue.cioosatlantic.ca/dataset?q=cmar). Data collection and retrieval are ongoing. The datasets and reports may be revised pending ongoing data collection and analyses. If you have accessed any Coastal Monitoring Program data, CMAR would appreciate your feedback:\u00a0https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3TD6umrsVVKnQL13VVMJIpckCi2ctONJsgN7_g-4c-tKTuw/viewform.

The results of these tests are summarized in the \u201cqc_flag\u201d columns of the dataset. Each data point is assigned a flag value of \u201cPass\u201d, \u201cSuspect/Of Interest\u201d, \u201cFail\u201d, or \u201cNot Evaluated\u201d. Observations flagged as \u201cPass\u201d passed all tests and can be included in analyses. Dissolved oxygen observations flagged as \u201cSuspect/Of Interest\u201d likely indicate biofouling signals and should be excluded from analysis or used with extreme caution. Observations for other variables flagged as \u201cSuspect/Of Interest\u201d should be reviewed before being included in analyses. Observations flagged as \u201cFail\u201d should be excluded from most analyses. Some tests cannot be applied to certain observations, which will be flagged as \u201cNot Evaluated\u201d. These observations can typically be included in analyses. Flags should be used as a guide only, and data users are responsible for evaluating the quality of the data prior to use in any analysis. For more information about the Quality Control tests, visit the CMAR Data Governance website (https://dempsey-cmar.github.io/cmp-data-governance/pages/cmp_about.html). The Coastal Monitoring Program Water Quality data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends filtering the data to the waterbody, station, depth, quality control flag, and/or time period of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/a3qb-nf5k). The \"Nova Scotia Water Quality Data: Station Locations\" dataset on this Portal shows additional locations with available Water Quality data collected through CMAR\u2019s Coastal Monitoring Program (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4). Summary reports by county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/coastal-monitoring-program/). Data can also be downloaded from the ERDAPP server through the Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System (CIOOS) platform (https://catalogue.cioosatlantic.ca/dataset?q=cmar). Data collection and retrieval are ongoing. The datasets and reports may be revised pending ongoing data collection and analyses.

This dataset includes data from the Current branch of the program. Data from the Water Quality and Wave branches of the program are also available on the Nova Scotia Open Data Portal. CMAR has worked with the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture (NSDFA) and marine service providers to measure ocean current at various locations in Nova Scotia since 2007. The data is collected with Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) deployed on the seafloor. An ADCP is a hydroacoustic current meter that measures water velocities over a range of depths. These sensors measure soundwaves scattered back from moving particles in the water column and use the Doppler effect to estimate speed and direction.  Current data is organized by county. Each county dataset includes data from multiple ADCP deployments that vary in instrument make, model, configuration, capability, and installation location. These characteristics should be taken into consideration when analyzing the data. The \u201cNova Scotia Current Data: Deployment Information\u201d dataset (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/rs2e-ekha) summarises the specifications of each deployment. Individual deployments are identified in the county dataset and metadata by a unique ID in the deployment_id column.   The county datasets are large and can exceed the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the waterbody, station, and/or deployment_id of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/mz4v-dpyc).   Current data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Current Data: Deployment Information\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/rs2e-ekha) Summary reports for each county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/coastal-monitoring-program/).

This dataset includes data from the Current branch of the program. Data from the Water Quality and Wave branches of the program are also available on the Nova Scotia Open Data Portal. CMAR has worked with the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture (NSDFA) and marine service providers to measure ocean current at various locations in Nova Scotia since 2007. The data is collected with Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) deployed on the seafloor. An ADCP is a hydroacoustic current meter that measures water velocities over a range of depths. These sensors measure soundwaves scattered back from moving particles in the water column and use the Doppler effect to estimate speed and direction. Current data is organized by county. Each county dataset includes data from multiple ADCP deployments that vary in instrument make, model, configuration, capability, and installation location. These characteristics should be taken into consideration when analyzing the data. The \u201cNova Scotia Current Data: Deployment Information\u201d dataset (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/rs2e-ekha) summarises the specifications of each deployment. Individual deployments are identified in the county dataset and metadata by a unique ID in the deployment_id column. The county datasets are large and can exceed the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the waterbody, station, and/or deployment_id of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/Fishing-and-Aquaculture/Antigonish-County-Daily-Average-Current-Speed-by-D/dxk4-auk4). Current data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Current Data: Deployment Information\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/rs2e-ekha) Summary reports for each county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/coastal-monitoring-program/).

This program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture in 2012 and CMAR became involved in 2017. CMAR collects water quality data (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and intermittent salinity) using autonomous sensors deployed on \u201csensor strings\u201d. A sensor string typically consists of a line anchored to the sea floor by an acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths below the surface (as measured at low tide). Alternatively, a string may be attached to surface moorings, including floating docks, buoys, and equipment. Sensor strings are deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour. Sensors are retrieved for data offload by triggering the acoustic release when applicable, by directly removing from surface moorings, or occasionally by divers or dragging.  The Coastal Monitoring Program data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the WATERBODY, STATION, DEPTH, VARIABLE, and/or TIMESTAMP of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Shelburne-County-Water-Quality-Data-Daily-Average-/5ech-4c5t). Water Quality Data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Water Quality Data: Station Locations\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4). Summary reports by county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/reports/). Data can also be downloaded from the ERDAPP server through the Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System (CIOOS) platform (https://catalogue.cioosatlantic.ca/dataset?q=cmar). Data collection and retrieval are ongoing. Some data are excluded from the final dataset during quality control processes. The datasets and reports may be revised pending ongoing data collection and analyses.  A note on units: For Halifax and Lunenburg counties, dissolved oxygen was measured in units of percent saturation or mg/L, depending on the sensor. For all other counties, dissolved oxygen was measured in units of percent saturation. Measurements in mg/L were corrected for salinity using the Garcia-Gordon (1992) salinity correction factor with a salinity value of 30.6 practical salinity units (based on available data for the region). This correction factor is not required for values recorded in percent saturation. Please contact info@cmar.ca for more information.

French Immersion students do not write this examination.  For the reading portion, students read different types of texts and answered questions about what they read. Students also completed two writing tasks. Student performance in writing was reported for the four components: Ideas, Organization, Language Use and Conventions. Individual student results were reported in four levels: Level 1 (below the expectation), Level 2 (approaching the expectation), Level 3 (at the expectation) Level 4 (above the expectation). Students also received a scaled score in reading (provincial mean = 500, standard deviation = 100, range 200-800). Nova Scotia teachers worked with the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development to develop this examination and to set the expectation of the examination.

This program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture in 2012 and CMAR became involved in 2017. CMAR collects water quality data (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and intermittent salinity) using autonomous sensors deployed on \u201csensor strings\u201d. A sensor string typically consists of a line anchored to the sea floor by an acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths below the surface (as measured at low tide). Alternatively, a string may be attached to surface moorings, including floating docks, buoys, and equipment. Sensor strings are deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour. Sensors are retrieved for data offload by triggering the acoustic release when applicable, by directly removing from surface moorings, or occasionally by divers or dragging.  The Coastal Monitoring Program data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the WATERBODY, STATION, DEPTH, VARIABLE, and/or TIMESTAMP of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Queens-County-Water-Quality-Data-Daily-Average-Val/twbe-dv9i). Water Quality Data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Water Quality Data: Station Locations\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4). Summary reports by county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/reports/). Data can also be downloaded from the ERDAPP server through the Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System (CIOOS) platform (https://catalogue.cioosatlantic.ca/dataset?q=cmar). Data collection and retrieval are ongoing. Some data are excluded from the final dataset during quality control processes. The datasets and reports may be revised pending ongoing data collection and analyses.  A note on units: For Halifax and Lunenburg counties, dissolved oxygen was measured in units of percent saturation or mg/L, depending on the sensor. For all other counties, dissolved oxygen was measured in units of percent saturation. Measurements in mg/L were corrected for salinity using the Garcia-Gordon (1992) salinity correction factor with a salinity value of 30.6 practical salinity units (based on available data for the region). This correction factor is not required for values recorded in percent saturation. Please contact info@cmar.ca for more information.  If you have accessed any of the Coastal Monitoring Program data, CMAR would appreciate your feedback through this quick questionnaire (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3TD6umrsVVKnQL13VVMJIpckCi2ctONJsgN7_g-4c-tKTuw/viewform).

This dataset includes data from the Current branch of the program. Data from the Water Quality and Wave branches of the program are also available on the Nova Scotia Open Data Portal. CMAR has worked with the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture (NSDFA) and marine service providers to measure ocean current at various locations in Nova Scotia since 2007. The data is collected with Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) deployed on the seafloor. An ADCP is a hydroacoustic current meter that measures water velocities over a range of depths. These sensors measure soundwaves scattered back from moving particles in the water column and use the Doppler effect to estimate speed and direction.  Current data is organized by county. Each county dataset includes data from multiple ADCP deployments that vary in instrument make, model, configuration, capability, and installation location. These characteristics should be taken into consideration when analyzing the data. The \u201cNova Scotia Current Data: Deployment Information\u201d dataset (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/rs2e-ekha) summarises the specifications of each deployment. Individual deployments are identified in the county dataset and metadata by a unique ID in the deployment_id column.   The county datasets are large and can exceed the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the waterbody, station, and/or deployment_id of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/e9p6-as65).   Current data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Current Data: Deployment Information\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/rs2e-ekha). Summary reports for each county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/coastal-monitoring-program/). Data collection and retrieval are ongoing. Some data are excluded from the final dataset during quality control processes. Data have been trimmed of side-lobe interference. The datasets and reports may be revised pending ongoing data collection and analyses. CMAR recommends users apply additional quality control prior to using the data. If you have accessed any of the Current data, CMAR would appreciate your feedback through this quick questionnaire (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3TD6umrsVVKnQL13VVMJIpckCi2ctONJsgN7_g-4c-tKTuw/viewform).

Each individual row of data (Ensemble) from the wind-wave buoys presents wave height (significant, maximum) in metres and average wave direction in degrees relative to true north, corrected for localized magnetic declination specific to the deployment coordinates.

This program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture in 2012 and CMAR became involved in 2017. CMAR collects water quality data (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and intermittent salinity) using autonomous sensors deployed on \u201csensor strings\u201d. A sensor string typically consists of a line anchored to the sea floor by an acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths below the surface (as measured at low tide). Alternatively, a string may be attached to surface moorings, including floating docks, buoys, and equipment. Sensor strings are deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour. Sensors are retrieved for data offload by triggering the acoustic release when applicable, by directly removing from surface moorings, or occasionally by divers or dragging. The Coastal Monitoring Program data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the WATERBODY, STATION, DEPTH, VARIABLE, and/or TIMESTAMP of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Victoria-County-Water-Quality-Data-Daily-Average-V/chb4-suz2). Water Quality Data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Water Quality Data: Station Locations\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4). Summary reports by county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/reports/). Data can also be downloaded from the ERDAPP server through the Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System (CIOOS) platform (https://catalogue.cioosatlantic.ca/dataset?q=cmar). Data collection and retrieval are ongoing. Some data are excluded from the final dataset during quality control processes. The datasets and reports may be revised pending ongoing data collection and analyses. A note on units: For Halifax and Lunenburg counties, dissolved oxygen was measured in units of percent saturation or mg/L, depending on the sensor. For all other counties, dissolved oxygen was measured in units of percent saturation. Measurements in mg/L were corrected for salinity using the Garcia-Gordon (1992) salinity correction factor with a salinity value of 30.6 practical salinity units (based on available data for the region). This correction factor is not required for values recorded in percent saturation. Please contact info@cmar.ca for more information. If you have accessed any of the Coastal Monitoring Program data, CMAR would appreciate your feedback through this quick questionnaire (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3TD6umrsVVKnQL13VVMJIpckCi2ctONJsgN7_g-4c-tKTuw/viewform).

the province of Nova Scotia and its 18 individual census divisions (counties). Results are presented for two emissions scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), four time periods (1981-2010, 2015-2045, 2035-2065, and 2065-2095), and three different percentiles for each to show the model range (p05, p50, and p95). The time periods were calculated by fitting a linear trend to the 31-year periods and taking the average, so 2065-2095 equates to the expected SLR in 2080 (representing the middle year of each time period). The maximum, mean, and minimum values for each region represent the statistics for different locations within each county (e.g., for Annapolis, looking at RCP8.5 p50 in 2080, anticipated sea level rise is between 55.7-58.3 cm depending where in the county you are). Sea level rise projections were developed for Canada by James et al. (Geological Survey of Canada, 2021, Open File 8764). This information incorporates the most recent sea level projections from IPCC AR5 (Church et al., 2013a) which includes contributions from glaciers and thermo-steric expansion of the ocean. The local contributions to sea level rise associated with glacial isostatic adjustment were updated with the NAD83v70VG vertical land motion (Robin et al., 2020).

For the reading portion of the assessment, students read different types of texts and answered questions about what they read. For the writing portion of the assessment, students completed two writing tasks. Student performance in writing was reported for the four components: Ideas, Organization, Language Use and Conventions. Individual student results were reported in four levels: Level 1 (below the expectation), Level 2 (approaching the expectation), Level 3 (at the expectation) Level 4 (above the expectation). Students also received a scaled score in reading (provincial mean = 500, standard deviation = 100, range 200-800). Nova Scotia teachers worked with the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development to build this assessment, score the writing tasks and set the performance expectations in Reading and Writing. The expectation is what students should know and be able to do on their own at the end of grade 8. As of April 1, 2018, Nova Scotia Regional School Boards became Regional Centres for Education (RCE).

The program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture in the early 1990s. In 2019, CMAR assumed responsibility for the program and expanded its scope and mandate. Through the Water Quality Branch of the program, CMAR collects temperature, dissolved oxygen, and salinity data using sensors deployed on \u201csensor strings\u201d. A sensor string typically consists of a line anchored to the sea floor by an acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths below the surface (as measured at low tide). Alternatively, a string may be attached to surface moorings, including floating docks, buoys, and equipment. Sensor strings are deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour. Sensors are retrieved for data offload by triggering the acoustic release when applicable, by directly removing from surface moorings, or occasionally by divers or grappling methods. Automated Quality Control tests have been applied to the data to identify outlying and unexpected observations. The results of these tests are summarized in the \u201cqc_flag\u201d columns of the dataset. Each data point is assigned a flag value of \u201cPass\u201d, \u201cSuspect/Of Interest\u201d, \u201cFail\u201d, or \u201cNot Evaluated\u201d. Observations flagged as \u201cPass\u201d passed all tests and can be included in analyses. Dissolved oxygen observations flagged as \u201cSuspect/Of Interest\u201d likely indicate biofouling signals and should be excluded from analysis or used with extreme caution. Observations for other variables flagged as \u201cSuspect/Of Interest\u201d should be reviewed before being included in analyses. Observations flagged as \u201cFail\u201d should be excluded from most analyses. Some tests cannot be applied to certain observations, which will be flagged as \u201cNot Evaluated\u201d. These observations can typically be included in analyses. Flags should be used as a guide only, and data users are responsible for evaluating the quality of the data prior to use in any analysis. For more information about the Quality Control tests, visit the CMAR Data Governance website (https://dempsey-cmar.github.io/cmp-data-governance/pages/cmp_about.html). The Coastal Monitoring Program Water Quality data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends filtering the data to the waterbody, station, depth, quality control flag, and/or time period of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/5p9y-iyag). The \"Nova Scotia Water Quality Data: Station Locations\" dataset on this Portal shows additional locations with available Water Quality data collected through CMAR\u2019s Coastal Monitoring Program (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4). Summary reports by county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/coastal-monitoring-program/). Data can also be downloaded from the ERDAPP server through the Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System (CIOOS) platform (https://catalogue.cioosatlantic.ca/dataset?q=cmar).

It delineates all the forest areas on publicly owned land within the province (see Appendix B of the Old-Growth Forest Policy 2022) that were accounted for as old-growth forest areas and old-growth restoration opportunities. The primary source of information used to identify the areas accounted for under the 2012 Old Forest Policy was the province\u2019s forest inventory database. Additional data such as field surveys have been used, where possible, to identify specific additional areas to add to the Old-Growth Forest Policy Layer and to improve the quality of information on specific areas already identified using the forest inventory database. The Old-Growth Forest Policy Layer is managed as a geospatial database independent of the forest inventory database. This acknowledges that the boundaries of old-growth forest areas and old-growth restoration opportunities may not align perfectly with the stand boundaries of the forest inventory database on account of additional data collected in the field as well as re-interpretations of stand boundaries as the forest inventory database is updated.   The Old-Growth Forest Policy contains both accounting provisions and protection provisions. The protection provisions only apply to the management of Crown land by the Department of Natural Resources and Renewables. It is administered by the Minister of Natural Resources and Renewables under the authority of the Crown Lands Act of 1989. The accounting provisions apply to all forested land in Nova Scotia held by Her Majesty in right of both the province and the Government of Canada including (a) Crown land, (b) forested lands administered by the Minister of Environment and Climate Change under the Wilderness Areas Protection Act (wilderness areas) and the Special Places Protection Act (nature reserves), and (c) federal forested lands at the Kejimkujik and Cape Breton Highlands National Parks and the Fortress of Louisburg National Historic Site. Lands in categories (b) and (c) have their own legal provisions for protection under the authority of their respective jurisdictions, as do provincial parks under the Provincial Parks Act.  Old-growth forest restoration opportunities areas for accounting provision inside existing protected areas were identified using information from both the Predictive Ecosite Mapping (PEM) and the forest inventory database. Using these geospatial datasets, forest areas were identified based on only considering mature, late successional forest areas. Maturity was defined based on height criteria. Stand age, unless measured during a site visit, is not reliably estimated in the provincial forest inventory, and therefore and stand height is used as a proxy. Late-successional forest types are defined based on the Forest Ecosystem Classification (FEC) vegetation types identified in the Old-Growth Forest Policy (2022) (See section 3.0 of the Old-Growth Forest Policy 2022 for a full list).   The Old-Growth Forest Policy Layer contains an \u2018Old Growth\u2019 attribute used to indicate whether a stand has been confirmed as old growth forest. Stands outside of protected areas that have been confirmed as old growth forest using NRR\u2019s assessment protocol, are assigned a value of 1. Stands outside of protected areas, which are restoration opportunities or whose old growth status is unknown have a value of 0. All stands inside protected areas are given a value of 0.   The \u2019Selection Method\u2019 attribute in the Old-Growth Forest Policy Layer is used to indicate which method was used in adding stands to the layer. Stands inside protected areas that were added using data from the PEM and forest inventory, as describe above, are given a value of 2. All other stands added as either old growth or restoration opportunities are assigned a value of 1.  The location of all old growth in the Province is unknown, however NRR maintains a registry of old stands that have been evaluated using NRR's Old Forest Assessment system (http://www.gov.ns.ca/natr/forestry/programs/ecosystems/scoresht.asp).

This program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture in 2012 and CMAR became involved in 2017. CMAR collects temperature (degrees Celsius), dissolved oxygen (% saturation), and intermittent salinity (practical salinity units) data using autonomous sensors attached to moored lines, called \u2018sensor strings\u2019. Each string is attached to the seafloor by an anchored acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths. Sensor strings are typically deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour depending on the sensor. Data are retrieved by triggering the acoustic release, enabling the sensor string to float to the surface for data download. Some data are excluded from the final dataset during quality control processes.   The Coastal Monitoring Program data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. We recommend using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the WATERBODY, STATION, DEPTH, VARIABLE, and/or TIMESTAMP of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Data-Digby-County-Daily/yeii-vbir).   Coastal Monitoring Program data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Coastal Monitoring Program: Station Locations\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4). Summary reports by county are available on the CMAR website https://cmar.ca/reports/). Data collection and retrieval are ongoing.

Each individual row of data (Ensemble) from the wind-wave buoys presents wave height (significant, maximum) in metres and average wave direction in degrees relative to true north, corrected for localized magnetic declination specific to the deployment coordinates.

The program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture in the early 1990s. In 2019, CMAR assumed responsibility for the program and expanded its scope and mandate. Through the Water Quality Branch of the program, CMAR collects temperature, dissolved oxygen, and salinity data using sensors deployed on \u201csensor strings\u201d. A sensor string typically consists of a line anchored to the sea floor by an acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths below the surface (as measured at low tide). Alternatively, a string may be attached to surface moorings, including floating docks, buoys, and equipment. Sensor strings are deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour. Sensors are retrieved for data offload by triggering the acoustic release when applicable, by directly removing from surface moorings, or occasionally by divers or grappling methods. Automated Quality Control tests have been applied to the data to identify outlying and unexpected observations. The results of these tests are summarized in the \u201cqc_flag\u201d columns of the dataset. Each data point is assigned a flag value of \u201cPass\u201d, \u201cSuspect/Of Interest\u201d, \u201cFail\u201d, or \u201cNot Evaluated\u201d. Observations flagged as \u201cPass\u201d passed all tests and can be included in analyses. Dissolved oxygen observations flagged as \u201cSuspect/Of Interest\u201d likely indicate biofouling signals and should be excluded from analysis or used with extreme caution. Observations for other variables flagged as \u201cSuspect/Of Interest\u201d should be reviewed before being included in analyses. Observations flagged as \u201cFail\u201d should be excluded from most analyses. Some tests cannot be applied to certain observations, which will be flagged as \u201cNot Evaluated\u201d. These observations can typically be included in analyses. Flags should be used as a guide only, and data users are responsible for evaluating the quality of the data prior to use in any analysis. For more information about the Quality Control tests, visit the CMAR Data Governance website (https://dempsey-cmar.github.io/cmp-data-governance/pages/cmp_about.html). The Coastal Monitoring Program Water Quality data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends filtering the data to the waterbody, station, depth, quality control flag, and/or time period of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/vpt7-apvp). The \"Nova Scotia Water Quality Data: Station Locations\" dataset on this Portal shows additional locations with available Water Quality data collected through CMAR\u2019s Coastal Monitoring Program (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4). Summary reports by county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/coastal-monitoring-program/). Data can also be downloaded from the ERDAPP server through the Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System (CIOOS) platform (https://catalogue.cioosatlantic.ca/dataset?q=cmar). Data collection and retrieval are ongoing. The datasets and reports may be revised pending ongoing data collection and analyses.

This dataset includes data from the Current branch of the program. Data from the Water Quality and Wave branches of the program are also available on the Nova Scotia Open Data Portal. CMAR has worked with the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture (NSDFA) and marine service providers to measure ocean current at various locations in Nova Scotia since 2007. The data is collected with Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) deployed on the seafloor. An ADCP is a hydroacoustic current meter that measures water velocities over a range of depths. These sensors measure soundwaves scattered back from moving particles in the water column and use the Doppler effect to estimate speed and direction.  Current data is organized by county. Each county dataset includes data from multiple ADCP deployments that vary in instrument make, model, configuration, capability, and installation location. These characteristics should be taken into consideration when analyzing the data. The \u201cNova Scotia Current Data: Deployment Information\u201d dataset (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/rs2e-ekha) summarises the specifications of each deployment. Individual deployments are identified in the county dataset and metadata by a unique ID in the deployment_id column.   The county datasets are large and can exceed the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the waterbody, station, and/or deployment_id of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/9f4x-q35z).   Current data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through the Open Data Portal. The \"Nova Scotia Current Data: Deployment Information\" dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/rs2e-ekha). Summary reports for each county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/coastal-monitoring-program/). Data collection and retrieval are ongoing. Some data are excluded from the final dataset during quality control processes. Data have been trimmed of side-lobe interference. The datasets and reports may be revised pending ongoing data collection and analyses. CMAR recommends users apply additional quality control prior to using the data. If you have accessed any of the Current data, CMAR would appreciate your feedback through this quick questionnaire (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3TD6umrsVVKnQL13VVMJIpckCi2ctONJsgN7_g-4c-tKTuw/viewform).
