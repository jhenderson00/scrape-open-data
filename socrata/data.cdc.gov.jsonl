Although these data will continue to be publicly available, this dataset will no longer be updated.\n\nThis archived public use dataset has 11 data elements reflecting United States COVID-19 community levels for all available counties. \n\nThe COVID-19 community levels were developed using a combination of three metrics \u2014 new COVID-19 admissions per 100,000 population in the past 7 days, the percent of staffed inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients, and total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days. The COVID-19 community level was determined by the higher of the new admissions and inpatient beds metrics, based on the current level of new cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days. New COVID-19 admissions and the percent of staffed inpatient beds occupied represent the current potential for strain on the health system. Data on new cases acts as an early warning indicator of potential increases in health system strain in the event of a COVID-19 surge.\n\nUsing these data, the COVID-19 community level was classified as low, medium, or high.\n\nCOVID-19 Community Levels were used to help communities and individuals make decisions based on their local context and their unique needs. Community vaccination coverage and other local information, like early alerts from surveillance, such as through wastewater or the number of emergency department visits for COVID-19, when available, can also inform decision making for health officials and individuals.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date data for any county or state, visit the relevant health department website. COVID Data Tracker may display data that differ from state and local websites. This can be due to differences in how data were collected, how metrics were calculated, or the timing of web updates.\n\n<b>Archived Data Notes:</b>\n\nThis dataset was renamed from \"United States COVID-19 Community Levels by County as Originally Posted\" to \"United States COVID-19 Community Levels by County\" on March 31, 2022. \n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> Column name for county population was changed to \u201ccounty_population\u201d. No change was made to the data points previous released.\n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> New column, \u201chealth_service_area_population\u201d, was added to the dataset to denote the total population in the designated Health Service Area based on 2019 Census estimate. \n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> FIPS codes for territories American Samoa, Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and United States Virgin Islands were re-formatted to 5-digit numeric for records released on 3/3/2022 to be consistent with other records in the dataset.\n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> Changes were made to the text fields in variables \u201ccounty\u201d, \u201cstate\u201d, and \u201chealth_service_area\u201d so the formats are consistent across releases.\n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> The \u201c%\u201d sign was removed from the text field in column \u201ccovid_inpatient_bed_utilization\u201d. No change was made to the data. As indicated in the column description, values in this column represent the percentage of staffed inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients (7-day average).  \n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> Data values for columns, \u201ccounty_population\u201d, \u201chealth_service_area_number\u201d, and \u201chealth_service_area\u201d were backfilled for records released on 2/24/2022. These columns were added since the week of 3/3/2022, thus the values were previously missing for records released the week prior.\n\n<b>April 7, 2022:</b> Updates made to data released on 3/24/2022 for Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and United States Virgin Islands to correct a data mapping error.\n\n<b>April 21, 2022:</b> COVID-19 Community Level (CCL) data released for counties in Nebraska for the week of April 21, 2022 have 3 counties identified in the high category and 37 in the medium category.

These data reflect cases among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 24, 2022, and deaths among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 3, 2022. \n\nVaccination status: A person vaccinated with a primary series had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after verifiably completing the primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series \u226514 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected.\nAdditional or booster dose: A person vaccinated with a primary series and an additional or booster dose had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after receipt of an additional or booster dose of any COVID-19 vaccine on or after August 13, 2021. For people ages 18 years and older, data are graphed starting the week including September 24, 2021, when a COVID-19 booster dose was first recommended by CDC for adults 65+ years old and people in certain populations and high risk occupational and institutional settings. For people ages 12-17 years, data are graphed starting the week of December 26, 2021, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for adolescents ages 16-17 years. For people ages 5-11 years, data are included starting the week of June 5, 2022, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for children aged 5-11 years. For people ages 50 years and older, data on second booster doses are graphed starting the week including March 29, 2022, when the recommendation was made for second boosters. Vertical lines represent dates when changes occurred in U.S. policy for COVID-19 vaccination (details provided above). Reporting is by primary series vaccine type rather than additional or booster dose vaccine type. The booster dose vaccine type may be different than the primary series vaccine type. \n** Because data on the immune status of cases and associated deaths are unavailable, an additional dose in an immunocompromised person cannot be distinguished from a booster dose. This is a relevant consideration because vaccines can be less effective in this group.\nDeaths: A COVID-19\u2013associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died; health department staff reviewed to make a determination using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources. Rates of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status are reported based on when the patient was tested for COVID-19, not the date they died. Deaths usually occur up to 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.\nParticipating jurisdictions: Currently, these 31 health departments that regularly link their case surveillance to immunization information system data are included in these incidence rate estimates: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, New York City (New York), North Carolina, Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia; 30 jurisdictions also report deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people. These jurisdictions represent 72% of the total U.S. population and all ten of the Health and Human Services Regions.

CSTE updated the position statement on August 5, 2020 to clarify the interpretation of antigen detection tests and serologic test results within the case classification (<a href=\"https://www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/positionstatement2020/Interim-20-ID-02_COVID-19.pdf\">Interim-20-ID-02</a>). The statement also recommended that all states and territories enact laws to make COVID-19 reportable in their jurisdiction, and that jurisdictions conducting surveillance should submit case notifications to CDC. COVID-19 case surveillance data collected by jurisdictions are shared voluntarily with CDC.\nFor more information, visit: \n<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/action/stories/covid-19-response.html\">NNDSS Supports the COVID-19 Response | CDC</a>.<br>\n\n\n<b>COVID-19 Case Reports</b>\n\nCOVID-19 case reports are routinely", "attribution": "CDC Data, Analytics and Visualization Task Force", "attribution_link": "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/index.html", "contact_email": "eocevent394@cdc.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-08-04T23:43:39.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-02-03T16:17:22.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-08-04T21:31:22.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-08-04T23:43:39.000Z", "columns_name": ["icu_yn", "ethnicity", "sex", "res_county", "case_onset_interval", "state_fips_code", "case_month", "race", "age_group", "hosp_yn", "exposure_yn", "process", "case_positive_specimen_interval", "county_fips_code", "symptom_status", "underlying_conditions_yn", "res_state", "current_status", "death_yn"], "columns_field_name": ["icu_yn", "ethnicity", "sex", "res_county", "case_onset_interval", "state_fips_code", "case_month", "race", "age_group", "hosp_yn", "exposure_yn", "process", "case_positive_specimen", "county_fips_code", "symptom_status", "underlying_conditions_yn", "res_state", "current_status", "death_yn"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Was the patient admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU)?

Excess deaths are typically defined as the difference between observed numbers of deaths and expected numbers. This visualization provides weekly data on excess deaths by jurisdiction of occurrence. Counts of deaths in more recent weeks are compared with historical trends to determine whether the number of deaths is significantly higher than expected.\n\nEstimates of excess deaths can be calculated in a variety of ways, and will vary depending on the methodology and assumptions about how many deaths are expected to occur. Estimates of excess deaths presented in this webpage were calculated using Farrington surveillance algorithms (1). For each jurisdiction, a model is used to generate a set of expected counts, and the upper bound of the 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) of these expected counts is used as a threshold to estimate excess deaths. Observed counts are compared to these upper bound estimates to determine whether a significant increase in deaths has occurred. Provisional counts are weighted to account for potential underreporting in the most recent weeks. However, data for the most recent week(s) are still likely to be incomplete. Only about 60% of deaths are reported within 10 days of the date of death, and there is considerable variation by jurisdiction.

This dataset contains archived community transmission and related data elements by county as originally displayed on the COVID Data Tracker.

An archived dataset containing weekly community transmission data by county as originally posted can also be found here: <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/dt66-w6m6\">Weekly COVID-19 County Level of Community Transmission as Originally Posted | Data | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov)</a>. \n\n<b>Related data</b>\nCDC has been providing the public with two versions of COVID-19 county-level community transmission level data: this dataset with the daily values as originally posted on the COVID Data Tracker, and an historical dataset with daily data as well as the updates and corrections from state and local health departments. Similar to this dataset, the <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-T/nra9-vzzn\">original historical dataset</a> is archived on 10/20/2022. It will continue to be publicly available but will no longer be updated. A new dataset containing historical community transmission data by county is now published weekly and can be found at: <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/dataset/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/jgk8-6dpn\">Weekly COVID-19 County Level of Community Transmission Historical Changes | Data | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov)</a>.\n\nThis public use dataset has 7 data elements reflecting community transmission levels for all available counties and jurisdictions. It contains reported daily transmission levels at the county level with the same values used to display transmission maps on the COVID Data Tracker. Each day, the dataset is appended to contain the most recent day's data. Transmission level is set to low, moderate, substantial, or high using the calculation rules below.\n\n<b>Methods for calculating county level of community transmission indicator</b>\nThe County Level of Community Transmission indicator uses two metrics: (1) total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 persons in the last 7 days and (2) percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) in the last 7 days. For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission values as low, moderate, substantial, or high (below and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7030e2.htm?s_cid=mm7030e2_w#T1_down\">here</a>). If the values for each of these two metrics differ (e.g., one indicates moderate and the other low), then the higher of the two should be used for decision-making.\n\n<b>CDC core metrics of and thresholds for community transmission levels of SARS-CoV-2</b>\n\n<b>Total New Case Rate Metric:</b> \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is calculated by adding the number of new cases in the county (or other administrative level) in the last 7 days divided by the population in the county (or other administrative level) and multiplying by 100,000. \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is considered to have a transmission level of Low (0-9.99); Moderate (10.00-49.99); Substantial (50.00-99.99); and High (greater than or equal to 100.00).\n\n<b>Test Percent Positivity Metric:</b> \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is calculated by dividing the number of positive tests in the county (or other administrative level) during the last 7 days by the total number of tests conducted over the last 7 days. \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is considered to have a transmission level of Low (less than 5.00); Moderate (5.00-7.99); Substantial (8.00-9.99); and High (greater than or equal to 10.00).\n\nIf", "attribution": "CDC COVID-19 Response", "attribution_link": "https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view", "contact_email": "eocevent394@cdc.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-05-11T21:41:48.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-08-06T15:10:05.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-05-11T21:41:48.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-10-20T00:02:27.000Z", "columns_name": ["county_name", "report_date", "cases_per_100K_7_day_count_change", "fips_code", "community_transmission_level", "percent_test_results_reported_positive_last_7_days", "state_name"], "columns_field_name": ["county_name", "report_date", "cases_per_100k_7_day_count", "fips_code", "community_transmission_level", "percent_test_results_reported", "state_name"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["County", "Date county level of community transmission indicator reported on COVID Data Tracker", "Total number of new cases per 100,000 persons within the last 7 days", "County FIPS code, zero padded", "Community Transmission Level Indicator [low, moderate, substantial, high, blank]", "Percentage of positive diagnostic and screening nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) during the last 7 days", "State"], "columns_format": [{}, {"view": "date_ymd"}, {}, {}, {}, {"precision": "2"}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2021-09-21T17:52:14.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Public Health Surveillance", "domain_tags": ["case", "community transmission", "coronavirus", "county", "covid-19", "laboratory"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Email", "value": "eocevent394@cdc.gov"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "009:020"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Public-Access-Level", "value": "public"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Temporal-Applicability", "value": "2021-08-16/2022-10-19"}, {"key": "Common-Core_References", "value": "https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-County-Level-of-Community-Transmissi/nra9-vzzn"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Geographic-Coverage", "value": "US"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "CDC"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "No longer updated (dataset archived)"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "009:20"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Name", "value": "Surveillance Review and Response Group"}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Suggested-Citation", "value": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 Response.

These data reflect cases among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 24, 2022, and deaths among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 3, 2022. \n\nVaccination status: A person vaccinated with a primary series had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after verifiably completing the primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series \u226514 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected.\nAdditional or booster dose: A person vaccinated with a primary series and an additional or booster dose had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after receipt of an additional or booster dose of any COVID-19 vaccine on or after August 13, 2021. For people ages 18 years and older, data are graphed starting the week including September 24, 2021, when a COVID-19 booster dose was first recommended by CDC for adults 65+ years old and people in certain populations and high risk occupational and institutional settings. For people ages 12-17 years, data are graphed starting the week of December 26, 2021, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for adolescents ages 16-17 years. For people ages 5-11 years, data are included starting the week of June 5, 2022, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for children aged 5-11 years. For people ages 50 years and older, data on second booster doses are graphed starting the week including March 29, 2022, when the recommendation was made for second boosters. Vertical lines represent dates when changes occurred in U.S. policy for COVID-19 vaccination (details provided above). Reporting is by primary series vaccine type rather than additional or booster dose vaccine type. The booster dose vaccine type may be different than the primary series vaccine type.\n** Because data on the immune status of cases and associated deaths are unavailable, an additional dose in an immunocompromised person cannot be distinguished from a booster dose. This is a relevant consideration because vaccines can be less effective in this group.\nDeaths: A COVID-19\u2013associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died; health department staff reviewed to make a determination using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources. Rates of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status are reported based on when the patient was tested for COVID-19, not the date they died. Deaths usually occur up to 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.\nParticipating jurisdictions: Currently, these 31 health departments that regularly link their case surveillance to immunization information system data are included in these incidence rate estimates: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, New York City (New York), North Carolina, Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia; 30 jurisdictions also report deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people.

This dataset will receive a final update on June 1, 2023, to reconcile historical data through May 10, 2023, and will remain publicly available.\n\n<b>Aggregate Data Collection Process </b>\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, data have been gathered through a robust process with the following steps: \n<ul><li>A CDC data team reviews and validates the information obtained from jurisdictions\u2019 state and local websites via an overnight data review process.</li>\n<li>If more than one official county data source exists, CDC uses a comprehensive data selection process comparing each official county data source, and takes the highest case and death counts respectively, unless otherwise specified by the state. </li>\n<li>CDC compiles these data and posts the finalized information on COVID Data Tracker. </li>\n<li>County level data is aggregated to obtain state and territory specific totals.</li>\n</ul>This process is collaborative, with CDC and jurisdictions working together to ensure the accuracy of COVID-19 case and death numbers. County counts provide the most up-to-date numbers on cases and deaths by report date. CDC may retrospectively update counts to correct data quality issues. \n\n<b>Relation to Archived Dataset</b>\nPrior to October 20, 2022, CDC collected aggregate case and death data at the state level. This data was compiled and published daily on data.cdc.gov in a dataset called <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36\">United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State over Time</a>. As of 10/20/2022, this dataset has been archived and will no longer update. \n\n<b>Methodology Changes </b>\nSeveral differences exist between the current, weekly-updated dataset and the archived version of the <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36\">United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State over Time</a> dataset: \n<ul><li><b>Source:</b>\u202fThe current Weekly-Updated Version is based on county-level aggregate count data, while the Archived Version is based on State-level aggregate count data. </li>\n<li><b>Confirmed/Probable Cases/Death breakdown:\u202f</b> While the probable cases and deaths are included in the total case and total death counts in both versions (if applicable), they were reported separately from the confirmed cases and deaths by jurisdiction in the Archived Version.\u202f In the current Weekly-Updated Version, the counts by jurisdiction are not reported by confirmed or probable status (See Confirmed and Probable Counts section for more detail).</li>\n<li><b>Time Series Frequency:</b> The current Weekly-Updated Version contains weekly time series data (i.e., one record per week per jurisdiction), while the Archived Version contains daily time series data (i.e., one record per day per jurisdiction). </li>\n<li><b>Update Frequency:</b>\u202fThe current Weekly-Updated Version is updated weekly, while the Archived Version was updated twice daily up to October 20, 2022. </li></ul>\n<b>Important note:</b> The counts reflected during a given time period in this dataset may not match the counts reflected for the same time period in the archived dataset noted above.

This dataset includes 2017, 2016 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2017, 2016), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2013-2017, 2012-2016 estimates. Because some questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS, there are 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, pap tests, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleep less than 7 hours) from the 2016 BRFSS that are the same in the 2019 release as the previous 2018 release.

A new dataset containing community transmission data by county as originally posted is now published weekly and can be found at: <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/dataset/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/dt66-w6m6\">Weekly COVID-19 County Level of Community Transmission as Originally Posted | Data | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov)</a>.\n\nThis public use dataset has 7 data elements reflecting historical data for community transmission levels for all available counties and jurisdictions. It contains historical data for the county level of community transmission and includes updated data submitted by states and jurisdictions. Each day, the dataset was updated to include the most recent days\u2019 data and incorporate any historical changes made by jurisdictions. This dataset includes data since January 22, 2020. Transmission level is set to low, moderate, substantial, or high using the calculation rules below.\n\n<b>Methods for calculating county level of community transmission indicator</b>\nThe County Level of Community Transmission indicator uses two metrics: (1) total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 persons in the last 7 days and (2) percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) in the last 7 days. For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission values as low, moderate, substantial, or high (below and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7030e2.htm?s_cid=mm7030e2_w#T1_down\">here</a>). If the values for each of these two metrics differ (e.g., one indicates moderate and the other low), then the higher of the two should be used for decision-making.\n\n<b>CDC core metrics of and thresholds for community transmission levels of SARS-CoV-2</b>\n\n<b>Total New Case Rate Metric:</b> \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is calculated by adding the number of new cases in the county (or other administrative level) in the last 7 days divided by the population in the county (or other administrative level) and multiplying by 100,000. \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is considered to have transmission level of Low (0-9.99); Moderate (10.00-49.99); Substantial (50.00-99.99); and High (greater than or equal to 100.00).\n\n<b>Test Percent Positivity Metric:</b> \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is calculated by dividing the number of positive tests in the county (or other administrative level) during the last 7 days by the total number of tests resulted over the last 7 days. \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is considered to have transmission level of Low (less than 5.00); Moderate (5.00-7.99); Substa", "attribution": "CDC COVID-19 Response", "attribution_link": "https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view", "contact_email": "eocevent394@cdc.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-05-11T21:42:01.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-08-06T15:40:43.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-05-11T21:42:01.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-10-21T01:15:18.000Z", "columns_name": ["cases_per_100K_7_day_count_change", "percent_test_results_reported_positive_last_7_days", "state_name", "community_transmission_level", "date", "fips_code", "county_name"], "columns_field_name": ["cases_per_100k_7_day_count", "percent_test_results_reported", "state_name", "community_transmission_level", "date", "fips_code", "county_name"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Total number of new cases per 100,000 persons within the last 7 days", "Percentage of positive diagnostic and screening nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) during the last 7 days", "State", "Community Transmission Level Indicator [low, moderate, substantial, high, blank]", "Week ending date for the 7-day period for the case rate and the percent positivity", "County FIPS code, zero padded", "County"], "columns_format": [{}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "percentScale": "1", "precision": "2"}, {}, {}, {"view": "date"}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-01-06T19:05:28.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Public Health Surveillance", "domain_tags": ["cases", "community transmission", "coronavirus", "county", "covid-19", "laboratory"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Email", "value": "eocevent394@cdc.gov"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "009:020"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Public-Access-Level", "value": "public"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Temporal-Applicability", "value": "2020-01-22/2022-10-18"}, {"key": "Common-Core_References", "value": "https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-County-Level-of-Community-Transmissi/8396-v7yb"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Geographic-Coverage", "value": "US"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "CDC"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "No longer updated (dataset archived)"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "009:20"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Name", "value": "Surveillance Review and Response Group"}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Suggested-Citation", "value": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 Response.

Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch.

This dataset includes estimates for 36 measures: 13 for health outcomes, 9 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, and 3 for health status. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2021 or 2020 data, Census Bureau 2021 or 2020 county population estimate data, and American Community Survey 2017\u20132021, or 2016\u20132020 estimates.

For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission values as low, moderate, substantial, or high (below and\u202f<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7030e2.htm?s_cid=mm7030e2_w#T1_down\">here</a>).

Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years between 2000 and 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published. Data on age-adjusted death rates prior to 1999 are taken from historical data (see References below).\n\nLife expectancy data are available up to 2017. Due to changes in categories of race used in publications, data are not available for the black population consistently before 1968, and not at all before 1960.

PLACES covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 36 measures: 13 for health outcomes, 9 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, and 3 for health status. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2021 or 2020 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey 2015\u20132019 estimates. The 2023 release uses 2021 BRFSS data for 29 measures and 2020 BRFSS data for seven measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours) that the survey collects data on every other year.

On August 4, 2020, incomplete case counts were replaced with a \"U\" indicating case counts are not available for specified time period. \n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/.

PLACES is the expansion of the original 500 Cities project and covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia (DC)\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2019 or 2018 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015\u20132019 or 2014\u20132018 estimates. The 2021 release uses 2019 BRFSS data for 22 measures and 2018 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours a night). Seven measures are based on the 2018 BRFSS data because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. These data can be joined with the census tract 2015 boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 29 measures at the census tract level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software.

The data is grouped by different time periods including 3-month period, weekly, and total (cumulative since January 1, 2020). United States death counts and rates include the 50 states, plus the District of Columbia and New York City. New York state estimates exclude New York City. Puerto Rico is included in HHS Region 2 estimates.\n\nDeaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, coded to ICD\u201310 code U07.1. Number of deaths reported in this file are the total number of COVID-19 deaths received and coded as of the date of analysis and may not represent all deaths that occurred in that period. Counts of deaths occurring before or after the reporting period are not included in the file.\n\nData during recent periods are incomplete because of the lag in time between when the death occurred and when the death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes. This delay can range from 1 week to 8 weeks or more, depending on the jurisdiction and cause of death.\n\nDeath counts should not be compared across states. Data timeliness varies by state. Some states report deaths on a daily basis, while other states report deaths weekly or monthly. \n\nThe ten (10) United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regions include the following jurisdictions. Region 1: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont; Region 2: New Jersey, New York, New York City, Puerto Rico; Region 3: Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia; Region 4: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee; Region 5: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin; Region 6: Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas; Region 7: Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska; Region 8: Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming; Region 9: Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada; Region 10: Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Washington.\n\nRates were calculated using the population estimates for 2021, which are estimated as of July 1, 2021 based on the Blended Base produced by the US Census Bureau in lieu of the April 1, 2020 decennial population count. The Blended Base consists of the blend of Vintage 2020 postcensal population estimates, 2020 Demographic Analysis Estimates, and 2020 Census PL 94-171 Redistricting File (see https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology/2020-2021/methods-statement-v2021.pdf).\n\nRate are based on deaths occurring in the specified week/month and are age-adjusted to the 2000 standard population using the direct method (see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr70/nvsr70-08-508.pdf). These rates differ from annual age-adjusted rates, typically presented in NCHS publications based on a full year of data and annualized weekly/monthly age-adjusted rates which have been adjusted to allow comparison with annual rates.  Annualization rates presents deaths per year per 100,000 population that would be expected in a year if the observed period specific (weekly/monthly) rate prevailed for a full year.\n\nSub-national death counts between 1-9 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS data confidentiality standards. Rates based on death counts less than 20 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS standards of reliability as specified in NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions (available from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_175.pdf.).", "attribution": "NCHS/DVS", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "cdcinfo@cdc.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-08-16T14:37:20.000Z", "createdAt": "2023-03-31T18:42:26.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-08-16T14:37:11.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-08-16T14:37:20.000Z", "columns_name": ["crude_COVID_rate_ann", "aa_COVID_rate", "crude_COVID_rate", "data_period_start", "data_as_of", "data_period_end", "Jurisdiction_Residence", "pct_diff_wk", "pct_change_wk", "COVID_deaths", "aa_COVID_rate_ann", "footnote", "COVID_pct_of_total", "Group"], "columns_field_name": ["crude_covid_rate_ann", "aa_covid_rate", "crude_covid_rate", "data_period_start", "data_as_of", "data_period_end", "jurisdiction_residence", "pct_diff_wk", "pct_change_wk", "covid_deaths", "aa_covid_rate_ann", "footnote", "covid_pct_of_total", "group"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Crude COVID-19 death rate - annualized", "Age-adjusted COVID-19 death rate", "Crude COVID-19 death rate", "First date of data period", "Date of analysis", "Last date of data period", "Jurisdiction of Residence", "Absolute percent change by week,  % of deaths due to COVID-19 ", "Relative percent change by week, % of deaths due to COVID-19 ", "Deaths involving COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1)", "Age-adjusted COVID-19 death rate - annualized", "Footnote", "Percent of deaths due to COVID-19", "Time period of reporting"], "columns_format": [{"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"view": "date"}, {"view": "date"}, {"view": "date"}, {}, {}, {}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2023-04-06T18:25:42.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "NCHS", "domain_tags": ["coronavirus", "covid-19", "death rate", "deaths", "hhs region", "mortality", "nchs", "nvss", "puerto rico", "state", "united states"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Email", "value": "cdcinfo@cdc.gov"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "009:020"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Public-Access-Level", "value": "public"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Temporal-Applicability", "value": "2019-12-29/2023-07-29"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Geographic-Coverage", "value": "United States, Puerto Rico"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "National Center for Health Statistics"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "R/P1W"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "009:20"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Issued", "value": "2023-03-31"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Name", "value": "National Center for Health Statistics"}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Suggested-Citation", "value": "National Center for Health Statistics.

The PLACES project is the expansion of the original 500 Cities project and covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia (DC)\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code tabulation Areas (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2018 or 2017 data, Census Bureau 2018 or 2017 county population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2018 or 2013-2017 estimates. The 2020 release uses 2018 BRFSS data for 23 measures and 2017 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening). Four measures are based on the 2017 BRFSS data because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. These data can be joined with the census 2015 county boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 27 measures at the county level.

This is the largest nationwide COVID-19 seroprevalence survey to date. De-identified blood samples are tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to better understand the percentage of people in the United States who have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and to track how this percentage changes over time. Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccines currently used in the United States result in production of anti-spike (anti-S) antibodies but only infection results in production of anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) antibodies. Infection-induced seroprevalence estimates the proportion of the population with evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and refers to the prevalence of the population with both anti-S and anti-N antibodies.\n\nThis link connects to a webpage that displays the data from the Nationwide Blood Donor Seroprevalence Survey.

On April 5, 2020, COVID-19 was added to the <a href=\"https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/search-results-year/\"> Nationally Notifiable Condition List </a> and classified as \"immediately notifiable, urgent (within 24 hours)\" by a Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) Interim Position Statement (<a href=\"https://www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/positionstatement2020/Interim-20-ID-01_COVID-19_NO.pdf\">Interim-20-ID-01</a>). CSTE updated the position statement on August 5, 2020 to clarify the interpretation of antigen detection tests and serologic test results within the case classification (<a href=\"https://www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/positionstatement2020/Interim-20-ID-02_COVID-19.pdf\">Interim-20-ID-02</a>). The statement also recommended that all states and territories enact laws to make COVID-19 reportable in their jurisdiction, and that jurisdictions conducting surveillance should submit case notifications to CDC. COVID-19 case surveillance data collected by jurisdictions are shared voluntarily with CDC.\nFor more information, visit: \n<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/action/stories/covid-19-response.html\">NNDSS Supports the COVID-19 Response | CDC</a>.<br>\n\n\n<b>COVID-19 Case Reports</b>\n\nCOVID-19 case reports are routinely", "attribution": "CDC Data, Analytics and Visualization Task Force", "attribution_link": "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/index.html", "contact_email": "eocevent394@cdc.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-08-04T23:43:39.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-02-03T16:17:22.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-08-04T21:31:22.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-08-04T23:43:39.000Z", "columns_name": ["icu_yn", "ethnicity", "sex", "res_county", "case_onset_interval", "state_fips_code", "case_month", "race", "age_group", "hosp_yn", "exposure_yn", "process", "case_positive_specimen_interval", "county_fips_code", "symptom_status", "underlying_conditions_yn", "res_state", "current_status", "death_yn"], "columns_field_name": ["icu_yn", "ethnicity", "sex", "res_county", "case_onset_interval", "state_fips_code", "case_month", "race", "age_group", "hosp_yn", "exposure_yn", "process", "case_positive_specimen", "county_fips_code", "symptom_status", "underlying_conditions_yn", "res_state", "current_status", "death_yn"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Was the patient admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU)?

It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2018 or 2017 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2018 or 2013-2017 estimates. The 2020 release uses 2018 BRFSS data for 23 measures and 2017 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening). Four measures are based on the 2017 BRFSS data because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. These data can be joined with the 2019 Census TIGER/Line place boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 27 measures at the place level.

Although these data will continue to be publicly available, this dataset will no longer be updated.\n\nThe surveillance case definition for COVID-19, a nationally notifiable disease, was first described in a <a href=\"https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/coronavirus-disease-2019-2021/\">position statement</a> from the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists, which was later <a href=\"https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/\">revised</a>. However, there is some variation in how jurisdictions implemented these case definitions. More information on how CDC collects COVID-19 case surveillance data can be found at <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html\">FAQ: COVID-19 Data and Surveillance</a>.\n\n<b>Aggregate Data Collection Process</b>\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, data were reported from state and local health departments through a robust process with the following steps:\n<ul><li>Aggregate county-level counts were obtained indirectly, via automated overnight web collection, or directly, via a data submission process.</li><li>If more than one official county data source existed, CDC used a comprehensive data selection process comparing each official county data source to retrieve the highest case and death counts, unless otherwise specified by the state.</li><li>A CDC data team reviewed counts for congruency prior to integration and set up alerts to monitor for discrepancies in the data.</li><li>CDC routinely compiled these data and post the finalized information on COVID Data Tracker.</li><li>County level data were aggregated to obtain state- and territory- specific totals.</li><li>Counting of cases and deaths is based on date of report and not on the date of symptom onset. CDC calculates rates in these data by using population estimates provided by the US Census Bureau Population Estimates Program (2019 Vintage).</li><li>COVID-19 aggregate case and death data are organized in a time series that includes cumulative number of cases and deaths as reported by a jurisdiction on a given date.  New case and death counts are calculated as the week-to-week change in cumulative counts of cases and deaths reported (i.e., newly reported cases and deaths = cumulative number of cases/deaths reported this week minus the cumulative total reported the prior week.</li></ul>\n\nThis process was collaborative, with CDC and jurisdictions working together to ensure the accuracy of COVID-19 case and death numbers. County counts provided the most up-to-date numbers on cases and deaths by report date. Throughout data collection, CDC retrospectively updated counts to correct known data quality issues.\n\n<b>Description</b>\nThis archived public use dataset focuses on the cumulative and weekly case and death rates per 100,000 persons within various sociodemographic factors across all states and their counties. All resulting data are expressed as rates calculated as the number of cases or deaths per 100,000 persons in counties meeting various classification criteria using <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html\">the US Census Bureau Population Estimates Program</a> (2019 Vintage).\n\nEach county within jurisdictions is classified into multiple categories for each factor. All rates in this dataset are based on classification of counties by the characteristics of their population, not individual-level factors.  This applies to each of the available factors observed in this dataset. Specific factors and their corresponding categories are detailed below.\n\n<b>Population-level factors</b>\nEach unique population factor is detailed below.

It contains historical data for the county level of community transmission and includes updated data submitted by states and jurisdictions. Each day, the dataset was updated to include the most recent days\u2019 data and incorporate any historical changes made by jurisdictions. This dataset includes data since January 22, 2020. Transmission level is set to low, moderate, substantial, or high using the calculation rules below.\n\n<b>Methods for calculating county level of community transmission indicator</b>\nThe County Level of Community Transmission indicator uses two metrics: (1) total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 persons in the last 7 days and (2) percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) in the last 7 days. For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission values as low, moderate, substantial, or high (below and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7030e2.htm?s_cid=mm7030e2_w#T1_down\">here</a>).

{"resource": {"name": "NCHS - Injury Mortality: United States", "id": "nt65-c7a7", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This dataset describes injury mortality in the United States beginning in 1999. Two concepts are included in the circumstances of an injury death: intent of injury and mechanism of injury. Intent of injury describes whether the injury was inflicted purposefully (intentional injury) and, if purposeful, whether the injury was self-inflicted (suicide or self-harm) or inflicted by another person (homicide). Injuries that were not purposefully inflicted are considered unintentional (accidental) injuries. Mechanism of injury describes the source of the energy transfer that resulted in physical or physiological harm to the body. Examples of mechanisms of injury include falls, motor vehicle traffic crashes, burns, poisonings, and drownings (1,2). \r\n\r\nData are based on information from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Age-adjusted death rates (per 100,000 standard population) are based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for non-census years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\r\n\r\nCauses of injury death are classified by the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD\u201310). Categories of injury intent and injury mechanism generally follow the categories in the external-cause-of-injury mortality matrix (1,2). Cause-of-death statistics are based on the underlying cause of death.\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nCDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, mortality data (see http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm); and CDC WONDER (see http://wonder.cdc.gov).\r\n\r\nREFERENCES \r\n\r\n1.

It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 29 measures: 13 for health outcomes, 9 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, and 3 for health status. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities.

{"resource": {"name": "NCHS - Drug Poisoning Mortality by County: United States", "id": "p56q-jrxg", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This dataset contains model-based county estimates for drug-poisoning mortality. \r\n\r\nDeaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD\u201310). Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD\u201310 underlying cause-of-death codes X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined intent).\r\n\r\nEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132016 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\r\n\r\nDeath rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD\u201310 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, \u201cOther ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality\u201d (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Drug poisoning death rates may be underestimated in those instances.\r\n\r\nSmoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 population) were obtained according to methods described elsewhere (3\u20135). Briefly, two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year. These annual county-level estimates \u201cborrow strength\u201d across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3,5). Estimates for 1999-2015 have been updated, and may differ slightly from previously published estimates. Differences are expected to be minimal, and may result from different county boundaries used in this release (see below) and from the inclusion of an additional year of data. Previously published estimates can be found here for comparison.(6) Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colorado, and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (7,8). Additionally, Clifton Forge County, Virginia only appears on the mortality files prior to 2003, while Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. These counties were therefore merged with adjacent counties where necessary to create a consistent set of geographic units across the time period. County boundaries are largely consistent with the vintage 2005-2007 bridged-race population file geographies, with the modifications noted previously (7,8).\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n1.

Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD\u201310 underlying cause-of-death codes X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined intent).\r\n\r\nEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\r\n\r\nEstimate does not meet standards of reliability or precision. Death rates are flagged as \u201cUnreliable\u201d in the chart when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less.\r\n\r\nDeath rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD\u201310 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, \u201cOther ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality\u201d (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Estimates should be interpreted with caution.\r\n\r\nSmoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 population) were obtained according to methods described elsewhere (3\u20135). Briefly, two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year during 1999\u20132015. These annual county-level estimates \u201cborrow strength\u201d across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3,5).

Carbapenemase-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae to Chancroid - 2019. In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \r\n\u00a7 Data for Carbapenemase-producing Carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (CP-CRE) will be displayed in this table after the CDC obtains Office of Management and Budget Paperwork Reduction Act approval to receive data for this

PLACES is the expansion of the original 500 Cities Project and covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia (DC)\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 29 measures: 4 chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 13 health outcomes, 3 health status, and 9 on using preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2019 or 2018 data, Census Bureau 2019 or 2018 county population estimate data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015\u20132019 or 2014\u20132018 estimates. The 2021 release uses 2019 BRFSS data for 22 measures and 2018 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours a night). Seven measures are based on the 2018 BRFSS because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS.

This dataset includes data from the retired BRFSS Vision Module. From 2005-2011 the BRFSS employed a ten question vision module regarding vision impairment, access and utilization of eye care, and self-reported eye diseases. In 2013 and subsequently, one question in the core of BRFSS asks about vision: \u201cAre you blind or do you have serious difficulty seeing, even when wearing glasses?\u201d The latest data for this core question can be found in the Vision and Eye Health Surveillance System (VEHSS). VEHSS is intended to provide population estimates of vision loss function, eye diseases, health disparities, as well as barriers and facilitators to access to vision and eye care. This information can be used for designing, implementing, and evaluating vision and eye health prevention programs.

This dataset will receive a final update on June 1, 2023, to reconcile historical data through May 10, 2023, and will remain publicly available.\n\n<b>Aggregate Data Collection Process </b>\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, data have been gathered through a robust process with the following steps: \n<ul><li>A CDC data team reviews and validates the information obtained from jurisdictions\u2019 state and local websites via an overnight data review process.</li>\n<li>If more than one official county data source exists, CDC uses a comprehensive data selection process comparing each official county data source, and takes the highest case and death counts respectively, unless otherwise specified by the state. </li>\n<li>CDC compiles these data and posts the finalized information on COVID Data Tracker. </li>\n<li>County level data is aggregated to obtain state and territory specific totals.</li>\n</ul>This process is collaborative, with CDC and jurisdictions working together to ensure the accuracy of COVID-19 case and death numbers. County counts provide the most up-to-date numbers on cases and deaths by report date. CDC may retrospectively update counts to correct data quality issues. \n\n<b>Relation to Archived Dataset</b>\nPrior to October 20, 2022, CDC collected aggregate case and death data at the state level. This data was compiled and published daily on data.cdc.gov in a dataset called <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36\">United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State over Time</a>. As of 10/20/2022, this dataset has been archived and will no longer update. \n\n<b>Methodology Changes </b>\nSeveral differences exist between the current, weekly-updated dataset and the archived version of the <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36\">United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State over Time</a> dataset: \n<ul><li><b>Source:</b>\u202fThe current Weekly-Updated Version is based on county-level aggregate count data, while the Archived Version is based on State-level aggregate count data. </li>\n<li><b>Confirmed/Probable Cases/Death breakdown:\u202f</b> While the probable cases and deaths are included in the total case and total death counts in both versions (if applicable), they were reported separately from the confirmed cases and deaths by jurisdiction in the Archived Version.\u202f In the current Weekly-Updated Version, the counts by jurisdiction are not reported by confirmed or probable status (See Confirmed and Probable Counts section for more detail).</li>\n<li><b>Time Series Frequency:</b> The current Weekly-Updated Version contains weekly time series data (i.e., one record per week per jurisdiction), while the Archived Version contains daily time series data (i.e., one record per day per jurisdiction). </li>\n<li><b>Update Frequency:</b>\u202fThe current Weekly-Updated Version is updated weekly, while the Archived Version was updated twice daily up to October 20, 2022. </li></ul>\n<b>Important note:</b> The counts reflected during a given time period in this dataset may not match the counts reflected for the same time period in the archived dataset noted above. Discrepancies may exist due to differences between county and state COVID-19 case surveillance and reconciliation efforts. \n\n<b>Confirmed and Probable Counts </b>\nIn this dataset, counts by jurisdiction are not displayed by confirmed or probable status.

This dataset contains estimates of the prevalence of visual acuity loss and major eye diseases generated using a Bayesian meta-analytic modeling approach that combines information from multiple data sources to produce comprehensive estimates of prevalence by age, race, and gender at the national, state and county levels. These composite prevalence estimates are the primary surveillance measures developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Vision & Eye Health Surveillance System (VEHSS).  \n\nFor more information about these estimates including summary tables and maps, methods, and links to related publications visit https://www.cdc.gov/visionhealth/vehss/estimates/index.html\nTo view this data in the VEHSS interactive data visualization application, visit https://ddt-vehss.cdc.gov/ and search for \u201cVEHSS Composite Prevalence Estimate\u201d.\n\n\nVisual Acuity Loss:\nVisual acuity loss prevalence estimates represent best-corrected visual acuity in the better-seeing eye and are included in rows where Category=\u2019Measured Visual Acuity\u2019.  Rows with Subgroup = \u2018Any vision loss' represents any impairment or blindness of 20/40 or worse; rows with Subgroup = 'US-defined blindness' refers to the subset of vision loss that is 20/200 or worse.\n\n\nAge Related Macular Degeneration:\nThe age-related macular degeneration (AMD) estimates represent AMD as measured with retinal imaging examination, and are included in rows where Category = \u2018Age Related Macular Degeneration\u2019.  The Subgroup \u2018Vision threatening AMD\u2019 includes patients with geographic atrophy, wet-form AMD, or choroidal neovascularization in either eye. The Subgroup \u2018Non-vision threatening AMD\u2019 includes patients with early or intermediate dry-form AMD defined as retinal pigment epithelium abnormalities or drusen \u2265125 \u00b5m in the worse-affected eye, and do not have vision threatening AMD.\n\n\nDiabetic Retinopathy:\nThe diabetic retinopathy (DR) estimates represent DR as measured with retinal imaging examination, and are included in rows where Category=\u2019Diabetic Eye Diseases\u2019.  The Subgroup \u2018Vision threatening DR\u2019 includes patients with severe non-proliferative DR, proliferative DR, and diabetic macular edema. The Subgroup \u2018Non-vision threatening DR\u2019 is defined as patients with mild-moderate non-proliferative DR or unspecified DR, and do not have vision threatening DR.\n\n\nGlaucoma:\nVEHSS Composite Prevalence Estimates for glaucoma are forthcoming. \n\n\nAge Groups:\nThe VEHSS Composite Prevalence Estimates are available by major age groups (All ages, ages 0-17, 18-39, 40-64, 65-84, 85+) and detailed (5-year) age groups, which are indicated by the text \u201cby detailed age groups\u201d in the \u2018Indicator\u2019 field. \n\n\nPrevalence Data Type:\nThese estimates are also available as crude (Data_Value_Type = \u2018Crude Prevalence\u2019) or adjusted data (Data_Value_Type=\u2019Adjusted Prevalence).  Crude Prevalence is the estimate of the actual number and percentage of people living with each condition.  Adjusted Prevalence estimates are adjusted to match the national population by age, race/ethnicity, and gender.  Adjusted prevalence estimates can be used to help identify disparities in prevalence between geographic areas that are not explained by differences in demographic characteristics.\n\n  \nData Sources:\nData sources for VEHSS Composite Prevalence Estimates include the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the American Community Survey (ACS), the National Survey of Children\u2019s Health (NSCH), the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), Medicare Fee-For-Service claims, the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System, MarketScan commercial insurance claims, the Health Resources & Service Administration\u2019s Area Resources File, and published examination study results from the Baltimore Pediatric Eye Disease Study (BPEDS), the Chinese American Eye Study (CHES), the Eye Diseases Prevalence Research Group (EDPRG), the Los Angeles Latino E", "attribution": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "ddtpubsmailbox@cdc.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-07-27T12:34:14.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-03-25T14:44:31.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-07-27T12:34:14.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-06-21T13:38:41.000Z", "columns_name": ["GeographicLevel", "RaceEthnicityID", "AgeID", "DataValueTypeID", "ResponseID", "QuestionID", "LocationID", "Sample_Size", "Numerator", "High_Confidence_Limit", "Low_Confidence_limit", "Data_Value", "Data_Value_Type", "RiskFactorResponse", "RiskFactor", "Age", "Subgroup", "Indicator", "Category", "LocationDesc", "LocationAbbr", "YearEnd", "YearStart", "GeoLocation", "RiskFactorResponseID", "RiskFactorID", "GenderID", "CategoryID", "TopicID", "Data_Value_Footnote", "Data_Value_Footnote_Symbol", "Data_Value_Unit", "RaceEthnicity", "Gender", "Topic", "DataSource"], "columns_field_name": ["geographiclevel", "raceethnicityid", "ageid", "datavaluetypeid", "responseid", "questionid", "locationid", "sample_size", "numerator", "high_confidence_limit", "low_confidence_limit", "data_value", "data_value_type", "riskfactorresponse", "riskfactor", "age", "response", "question", "category", "locationdesc", "locationabbr", "yearend", "yearstart", "geolocation", "riskfactorresponseid", "riskfactorid", "genderid", "categoryid", "topicid", "data_value_footnote", "data_value_footnote_symbol", "data_value_unit", "raceethnicity", "gender", "topic", "datasource"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Point", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Location descriptor (National, State, County)", "Lookup identifier value for the Race/Ethnicity stratification", "Lookup identifier value for the Age stratification", "Lookup identifier value for the Data Value Type", "Lookup identifier value for the Response", "Lookup identifier value for the Question", "Lookup identifier value for the Location.

{"resource": {"name": "Loss of Work Due to Illness from COVID-19", "id": "qgkx-mswu", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "The Research and Development Survey (RANDS) is a platform designed for conducting survey question evaluation and statistical research. RANDS is an ongoing series of surveys from probability-sampled commercial survey panels used for methodological research at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). RANDS estimates are generated using an experimental approach that differs from the survey design approaches generally used by NCHS, including possible biases from different response patterns and sampling frames as well as increased variability from lower sample sizes. Use of the RANDS platform allows NCHS to produce more timely data than would be possible using traditional data collection methods. RANDS is not designed to replace NCHS\u2019 higher quality, core data collections. Below are experimental estimates of loss of work due to illness with coronavirus for three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19. Data collection for the three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19 occurred between June 9, 2020 and July 6, 2020, August 3, 2020 and August 20, 2020, and May 17, 2021 and June 30, 2021. Information needed to interpret these estimates can be found in the Technical Notes. RANDS during COVID-19 included a question about the inability to work due to being sick or having a family member sick with COVID-19. The National Health Interview Survey, conducted by NCHS, is the source for high-quality data to monitor work-loss days and work limitations in the United States. For example, in 2018, 42.7% of adults aged 18 and over missed at least 1 day of work in the previous year due to illness or injury and 9.3% of adults aged 18 to 69 were limited in their ability to work or unable to work due to physical, mental, or emotional problems. The experimental estimates on this page are derived from RANDS during COVID-19 and show the percentage of U.S. adults who did not work for pay at a job or business, at any point, in the previous week because either they or someone in their family was sick with COVID-19.

PLACES covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 36 measures: 13 for health outcomes, 9 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, and 3 for health status. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations.

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/.

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/.

This dataset includes 2016, 2015 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2016, 2015), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2012-2016, 2011-2015 estimates. Because some questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS, there are 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, cholesterol screening) from the 2015 BRFSS that are the same in the 2018 release as the previous 2017 release.

Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD\u201310 underlying cause-of-death codes X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined intent).\n\nEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\n\nDeath rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD\u201310 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, \u201cOther ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality\u201d (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states.

It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 29 measures: 4 chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 13 health outcomes, 3 health status, and 9 on using preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2019 or 2018 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015\u20132019 or 2014\u20132018 estimates.

Seven measures are based on the 2018 BRFSS because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS.

PLACES covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia (DC)\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2020 or 2019 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015\u20132019 estimates. The 2022 release uses 2020 BRFSS data for 25 measures and 2019 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening) that the survey collects data on every other year. These data can be joined with the census tract 2015 boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 29 measures at the census tract level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software.\nhttps://cdcarcgis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=3b7221d4e47740cab9235b839fa55cd7", "attribution": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease

PLACES covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. This dataset includes estimates for 36 measures: 13 for health outcomes, 9 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, and 3 for health status. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations.

{"resource": {"name": "Reduced Access to Care During COVID-19", "id": "th9n-ghnr", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "The Research and Development Survey (RANDS) is a platform designed for conducting survey question evaluation and statistical research. RANDS is an ongoing series of surveys from probability-sampled commercial survey panels used for methodological research at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). RANDS estimates are generated using an experimental approach that differs from the survey design approaches generally used by NCHS, including possible biases from different response patterns and sampling frames as well as increased variability from lower sample sizes. Use of the RANDS platform allows NCHS to produce more timely data than would be possible using traditional data collection methods. RANDS is not designed to replace NCHS\u2019 higher quality, core data collections. Below are experimental estimates of reduced access to healthcare for three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19. Data collection for the three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19 occurred between June 9, 2020 and July 6, 2020, August 3, 2020 and August 20, 2020, and May 17, 2021 and June 30, 2021. Information needed to interpret these estimates can be found in the Technical Notes. RANDS during COVID-19 included questions about unmet care in the last 2 months during the coronavirus pandemic. Unmet needs for health care are often the result of cost-related barriers. The National Health Interview Survey, conducted by NCHS, is the source for high-quality data to monitor cost-related health care access problems in the United States. For example, in 2018, 7.3% of persons of all ages reported delaying medical care due to cost and 4.8% reported needing medical care but not getting it due to cost in the past year. However, cost is not the only reason someone might delay or not receive needed medical care. As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, people also may not get needed medical care due to cancelled appointments, cutbacks in transportation options, fear of going to the emergency room, or an altruistic desire to not be a burden on the health care system, among other reasons. The Household Pulse Survey (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/reduced-access-to-care.htm), an online survey conducted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by the Census Bureau in partnership with other federal agencies including NCHS, also reports estimates of reduced access to care during the pandemic (beginning in Phase 1, which started on April 23, 2020). The Household Pulse Survey reports the percentage of adults who delayed medical care in the last 4 weeks or who needed medical care at any time in the last 4 weeks for something other than coronavirus but did not get it because of the pandemic. The experimental estimates on this page are derived from RANDS during COVID-19 and show the percentage of U.S. adults who were unable to receive medical care (including urgent care, surgery, screening tests, ongoing treatment, regular checkups, prescriptions, dental care, vision care, and hearing care) in the last 2 months.

Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available.

For people ages 50 years and older, data on second booster doses are graphed starting the week including March 29, 2022, when the recommendation was made for second boosters. Vertical lines represent dates when changes occurred in U.S. policy for COVID-19 vaccination (details provided above). Reporting is by primary series vaccine type rather than additional or booster dose vaccine type. The booster dose vaccine type may be different than the primary series vaccine type.\n** Because data on the immune status of cases and associated deaths are unavailable, an additional dose in an immunocompromised person cannot be distinguished from a booster dose. This is a relevant consideration because vaccines can be less effective in this group.\nDeaths: A COVID-19\u2013associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died; health department staff reviewed to make a determination using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources. Rates of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status are reported based on when the patient was tested for COVID-19, not the date they died. Deaths usually occur up to 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.\nParticipating jurisdictions: Currently, these 31 health departments that regularly link their case surveillance to immunization information system data are included in these incidence rate estimates: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, New York City (New York), North Carolina, Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia; 30 jurisdictions also report deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people. These jurisdictions represent 72% of the total U.S. population and all ten of the Health and Human Services Regions.

Smallpox to Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome \u2013 2022. In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotes:\n\n\u2022\tThese are weekly cases of selected infectious national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables available at https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/data-statistics/index.html. Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are subject to ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Therefore, numbers listed in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Case counts in the tables are presented as published each week. See also Guide to Interpreting Provisional and Finalized NNDSS Data at https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/docs/Readers-Guide-WONDER-Tables-20210421-508.pdf.\n\u2022 Notices, errata, and other notes are available in the Notice To Data Users page at https://wonder.cdc.gov/nndss/NTR.html.\n\u2022\tThe list of national notifiable infectious diseases and conditions and their national surveillance case definitions are available at https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/. This list incorporates the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) position statements approved by CSTE for national surveillance.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n*Case counts for reporting years 2021 and 2022 are provisional and subject to change.

Estimates less than 10 are suppressed. These early model-based provisional estimates were generated using a multi-stage hierarchical Bayesian modeling process to generate smoothed estimates of the weekly numbers of death, accounting for reporting lags. These estimates are based on several assumptions about how the reporting lags have changed in recent months across different jurisdictions, and the resulting estimates differ from other sources of provisional mortality data.  For now, these estimates should be considered highly uncertain until further evaluations can be done to determine the validity of these assumptions about timeliness. The true patterns in reporting lags will not be known until data are finalized, typically 11\u201312 months after the end of the calendar year. Importantly, these estimates are not a replacement for monthly provisional drug overdose death counts, or quarterly provisional mortality estimates.

This data is already available on other websites, but this chart brings the information together into one view for comparison.  You can find additional information on the Accelerated and Advance Payments at the following links: \n\nFact Sheet: https://www.cms.gov/files/document/Accelerated-and-Advanced-Payments-Fact-Sheet.pdf; \n\nZip file on providers in each state: https://www.cms.gov/files/zip/accelerated-payment-provider-details-state.zip\n\nMedicare Accelerated and Advance Payments State-by-State information and by Provider Type: https://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-accelerated-and-advance-payments-state.pdf.\n\nThis file was assembled by HHS via CMS, HRSA and reviewed by leadership and compares the HHS Provider Relief Fund and the CMS Accelerated and Advance Payments by State and provider as of December 4, 2020.  \n\nHHS Provider Relief Fund \nPresident Trump is providing support to healthcare providers fighting the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic through the bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, & Economic Security Act and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, which provide a total of $175 billion for relief funds to hospitals and other healthcare providers on the front lines of the COVID-19 response. This funding supports healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19 and ensures uninsured Americans can get treatment for COVID-19. HHS is distributing this Provider Relief Fund money and these payments do not need to be repaid.\nThe Department allocated $50 billion of the Provider Relief Fund for general distribution to Medicare facilities and providers impacted by COVID-19, based on eligible providers' net reimbursement. It allocated another $22 billion to providers in areas particularly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, rural providers, and providers who serve low-income populations and uninsured Americans.  HHS will be allocating the remaining funds in the near future.\n  \nAs part of the Provider Relief Fund distribution, all providers have 45 days to attest that they meet certain criteria to keep the funding they received, including public disclosure.  As of May 15, 2020, there has been a total of $34 billion in attested payments.  The chart only includes those providers that have attested to the payments by that date.  We will continue to update this information and add the additional providers and payments once their attestation is complete. \n\nCMS Accelerated and Advance Payments Program\nOn March 28, 2020, to increase cash flow to providers of services and suppliers impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) expanded the Accelerated and Advance Payment Program to a broader group of Medicare Part A providers and Part B suppliers. Beginning on April 26, 2020, CMS stopped accepting new applications for the Advance Payment Program, and CMS began reevaluating all pending and new applications for Accelerated Payments in light of the availability of direct payments made through HHS\u2019s Provider Relief Fund.\n\nSince expanding the AAP program on March 28, 2020, CMS approved over 21,000 applications totaling $59.6 billion in payments to Part A providers, which includes hospitals, through May 18, 2020. For Part B suppliers\u2014including doctors, non-physician practitioners and durable medical equipment suppliers\u2014 during the same time period, CMS approved almost 24,000 applications advancing $40.4 billion in payments. The AAP program is not a grant, and providers and suppliers are required to repay the loan.\n\nCMS has published AAP data, as required by the Continuing Appropriations and Other Extensions Act of 2021, on this website: https://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-medicare-accelerated-and-advance-payments-program-covid-19-public-health-emergency-payment.pdf", "attribution": "Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services", "attribution_link": "https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/cares-act-provider-relief-fund/index.html", "contact_email": "HIGLASServiceDesk@gdit.com", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-08-08T12:24:28.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-05-21T13:23:38.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-08-08T12:21:48.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-08-08T12:24:28.000Z", "columns_name": ["AAP", "Provider Relief Fund", "Provider Name", "State / Territory"], "columns_field_name": ["aap", "provider_relief_fund", "provider_name", "state_territory"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-05-21T16:10:46.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["health", "public safety", "economy"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Administrative", "domain_tags": ["accelerated and advance payments", "cares act", "coronavirus", "covid-19", "provider relief fund"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Email", "value": "HIGLASServiceDesk@gdit.com"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "009:020"}, {"key": "Common-Core_References", "value": "https://www.cms.gov/files/document/Accelerated-and-Advanced-Payments-Fact-Sheet.pdf"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Geographic-Coverage", "value": "US"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "HHS ASPA"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "On a continuous basis"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "009:38"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Name", "value": "Megan Worstell "}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.cdc.gov", "license": "Public Domain U.S. Government"}, "permalink": "https://data.cdc.gov/d/v2pi-w3up", "link": "https://data.cdc.gov/Administrative/Provider-Relief-Fund-Accelerated-and-Advance-Payme/v2pi-w3up", "owner": {"id": "tjyw-xtku", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "HHS ASPA"}, "creator": {"id": "tjyw-xtku", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "HHS ASPA"}}

Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series \u226514 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected. \nTo estimate the number of unvaccinated persons in each MMWR week, the 2019 U.S. Census population estimates by jurisdiction and age group were used (except for California, where State Department of Finance 2021 population projections were determined to be more accurate). The number of unvaccinated persons each MMWR week was estimated by subtracting the cumulative number of vaccinated (all products) and partially vaccinated persons (all products) from the respective population totals for each jurisdiction and age group. \nContinuity correction: A continuity correction has been applied to the denominators by capping the percent population coverage at 95%. To do this, we assumed that at least 5% of each age group would always be unvaccinated in each jurisdiction.

These figures accompany this report by presenting information on potentially excess deaths in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas at the state level. They also add additional years of data and options for selecting different age ranges and benchmarks.\r\n\r\nPotentially excess deaths are defined in MMWR Surveillance Summary 66(No. SS-1):1-8 as deaths that exceed the numbers that would be expected if the death rates of states with the lowest rates (benchmarks) occurred across all states. They are calculated by subtracting expected deaths for specific benchmarks from observed deaths.\r\n\r\nNot all potentially excess deaths can be prevented; some areas might have characteristics that predispose them to higher rates of death. However, many potentially excess deaths might represent deaths that could be prevented through improved public health programs that support healthier behaviors and neighborhoods or better access to health care services.\r\n\r\nMortality data for U.S. residents come from the National Vital Statistics System.

It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2021 or 2020 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015\u20132019 estimates. The 2023 release uses 2021 BRFSS data for 29 measures and 2020 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours) that the survey collects data on every other year. These data can be joined with the 2019 Census TIGER/Line place boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 36 measures at the place level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS

This dataset includes 2015, 2014 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2015, 2014), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2011-2015, 2010-2014 estimates. Because some questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS, there are 7 measures from the 2014 BRFSS that are the same in the 2017 release as the previous 2016 release.

Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years between 2000 and 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published. Data on age-adjusted death rates prior to 1999 are taken from historical data (see References below).\n\nLife expectancy data are available up to 2017. Due to changes in categories of race used in publications, data are not available for the black population consistently before 1968, and not at all before 1960.

{"resource": {"name": "2020-2021 Nationwide Blood Donor Seroprevalence Survey Combined Infection- and Vaccination-Induced Seroprevalence Estimates", "id": "wi5c-cscz", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "CDC is collaborating with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Vitalant Research Institute (VRI), Westat Inc., and numerous blood collection organizations across the United States to conduct a nationwide COVID-19 seroprevalence survey of blood donors. This is the largest nationwide COVID-19 seroprevalence survey to date. De-identified blood samples are tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to better understand the percentage of people in the United States who have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and to track how this percentage changes over time. Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccines currently used in the United States result in production of anti-spike (anti-S) antibodies but only infection results in production of anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) antibodies. Combined seroprevalence estimates the proportion of the population with evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 vaccination, or both. It estimates the proportion of the population with some presumed protection against infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. The term \u201ccombined seroprevalence\u201d refers to the combined infection- and vaccination-induced SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalences. This is the population that has  anti-S antibodies, regardless of the presence of anti-N antibodies.\n\nThis link connects to a webpage that displays the data from the Nationwide Blood Donor Seroprevalence Survey.

NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up.  Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html.\r\n \r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\nC.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. \r\nU: Unavailable. \u2014: No reported cases. N: Not reportable. NA:  Not Available.  NN: Not Nationally Notifiable. NP: Nationally notifiable but not published. Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts. Med: Median.

Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD\u201310 underlying cause-of-death codes X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined intent).\r\n\r\nEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132016 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\r\n\r\nDeath rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD\u201310 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, \u201cOther ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality\u201d (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Drug poisoning death rates may be underestimated in those instances.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n1. National Center for Health Statistics. National Vital Statistics System: Mortality data.

Counts for the most recent final annual data are provided for comparison. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia as of the date specified and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Provisional counts are often incomplete and causes of death may be pending investigation resulting in an underestimate relative to final counts. To address this, methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays by generating a set of predicted provisional counts.\n\nSeveral data quality metrics, including the percent completeness in overall death reporting, percentage of deaths with cause of death pending further investigation, and the percentage of drug overdose deaths with specific drugs or drug classes reported are included to aid in interpretation of provisional data as these measures are related to the accuracy of provisional counts. Reporting of the specific drugs and drug classes involved in drug overdose deaths varies by jurisdiction, and comparisons of death rates involving specific drugs across selected jurisdictions should not be made. Provisional data presented will be updated on a monthly basis as additional records are received.\n\nFor more information please visit: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm", "attribution": "National Center for Health Statistics", "attribution_link": "https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm", "contact_email": "cdcinfo@cdc.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-08-16T13:57:56.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-03-06T19:13:01.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-08-16T13:57:48.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-08-16T13:57:56.000Z", "columns_name": ["State", "State Name", "Period", "Month", "Percent Complete", "Predicted Value", "Footnote", "Year", "Percent Pending Investigation", "Data Value", "Indicator", "Footnote Symbol"], "columns_field_name": ["state", "state_name", "period", "month", "percent_complete", "predicted_value", "footnote", "year", "percent_pending_investigation", "data_value", "indicator", "footnote_symbol"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ",", "align": "right"}, {"align": "right"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ",", "align": "right"}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ",", "align": "right"}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-04-17T15:47:04.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "public safety", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "NCHS", "domain_tags": ["cocaine", "deaths", "drug", "drug overdose", "heroin", "methadone", "monthly", "mortality", "nchs", "nvss", "opiate", "opioid", "provisional", "psychostimulants", "state", "united states", "vsrr"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Email", "value": "cdcinfo@cdc.gov"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "009:020"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Public-Access-Level", "value": "public"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Temporal-Applicability", "value": "2015-01-01/2023-02-28"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Geographic-Coverage", "value": "United States"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "National Center for Health Statistics"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "R/P1M"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Homepage", "value": "https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "009:20"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Issued", "value": "2018-03-06"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Name", "value": "National Center for Health Statistics"}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Suggested-Citation", "value": " National Center for Health Statistics.

Excess deaths are typically defined as the difference between observed numbers of deaths and expected numbers. This visualization provides weekly data on excess deaths by jurisdiction of occurrence. Counts of deaths in more recent weeks are compared with historical trends to determine whether the number of deaths is significantly higher than expected.\n\nEstimates of excess deaths can be calculated in a variety of ways, and will vary depending on the methodology and assumptions about how many deaths are expected to occur. Estimates of excess deaths presented in this webpage were calculated using Farrington surveillance algorithms (1). For each jurisdiction, a model is used to generate a set of expected counts, and the upper bound of the 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) of these expected counts is used as a threshold to estimate excess deaths. Observed counts are compared to these upper bound estimates to determine whether a significant increase in deaths has occurred. Provisional counts are weighted to account for potential underreporting in the most recent weeks. However, data for the most recent week(s) are still likely to be incomplete. Only about 60% of deaths are reported within 10 days of the date of death, and there is considerable variation by jurisdiction.

PLACES covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia (DC)\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. Project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2020 or 2019 data, Census Bureau 2020 or 2019 county population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2016\u20132020 or 2015\u20132019 estimates. The 2022 release uses 2020 BRFSS data for 25 measures and 2019 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening) that the survey collects data on every other year. These data can be joined with the census 2020 county boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 29 measures at the county level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software.

PLACES covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2021 or 2020 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015\u20132019 estimates. The 2023 release uses 2021 BRFSS data for 29 measures and 2020 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours) that the survey collects data on every other year. These data can be joined with the census tract 2015 boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 36 measures at the census tract level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software.\nhttps://cdcarcgis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=3b7221d4e47740cab9235b839fa55cd7", "attribution": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease

Although these data will continue to be publicly available, this dataset will no longer be updated.\n\n<b>Aggregate Data Collection Process\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, data were reported through a robust process with the following steps:</b><ul><li>Aggregate county-level counts were obtained indirectly, via automated overnight web collection, or directly, via a data submission process.</li><li>If more than one official county data source existed, CDC used a comprehensive data selection process comparing each official county data source to retrieve the highest case and death counts, unless otherwise specified by the state.</li><li>A CDC data team reviewed counts for congruency prior to integration. CDC routinely compiled these data and post the finalized information on COVID Data Tracker.</li><li>Cases and deaths are based on date of report and not on the date of symptom onset. CDC calculates rates in this data by using population estimates provided by the US Census Bureau Population Estimates Program (2019 Vintage).</li><li>COVID-19 aggregate case and death data were organized in a time series that includes cumulative number of cases and deaths as reported by a jurisdiction on a given date.  New case and death counts were calculated as the week-to-week change in reported cumulative cases and deaths (i.e., newly reported cases and deaths = cumulative number of cases/deaths reported this week minus the cumulative total reported the week before.</li></ul>\n\nThis process was collaborative, with CDC and jurisdictions working together to ensure the accuracy of COVID-19 case and death numbers. County counts provided the most up-to-date numbers on cases and deaths by report date. Throughout data collection, CDC retrospectively updated counts to correct known data quality issues. CDC also worked with jurisdictions after the end of the public health emergency declaration to finalize county data. \n<ul><li><b>Source:</b> The weekly archived dataset is based on county-level aggregate count data</li><li><b>Confirmed/Probable Cases/Death breakdown:</b> Cumulative cases and deaths for each county are included.  Total reported cases include probable and confirmed cases.</li><li><b>Time Series Frequency:</b> The weekly archived dataset contains weekly time series data (i.e., one record per week per county)</li></ul>\n \n<b>Important note:</b> The counts reflected during a given time period in this dataset may not match the counts reflected for the same time period in the daily archived dataset noted above. Discrepancies may exist due to differences between county and state COVID-19 case surveillance and reconciliation efforts.\n\nThe surveillance case definition for COVID-19, a nationally notifiable disease, was first described in a <a href=\"https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/\">position statement</a> from the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists, which was later <a href=\"https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/\">revised</a>. However, there is some variation in how jurisdictions implement these case classifications.
