Although these data will continue to be publicly available, this dataset will no longer be updated.\n\nThis archived public use dataset has 11 data elements reflecting United States COVID-19 community levels for all available counties. \n\nThe COVID-19 community levels were developed using a combination of three metrics \u2014 new COVID-19 admissions per 100,000 population in the past 7 days, the percent of staffed inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients, and total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days. The COVID-19 community level was determined by the higher of the new admissions and inpatient beds metrics, based on the current level of new cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days. New COVID-19 admissions and the percent of staffed inpatient beds occupied represent the current potential for strain on the health system. Data on new cases acts as an early warning indicator of potential increases in health system strain in the event of a COVID-19 surge.\n\nUsing these data, the COVID-19 community level was classified as low, medium, or high.\n\nCOVID-19 Community Levels were used to help communities and individuals make decisions based on their local context and their unique needs. Community vaccination coverage and other local information, like early alerts from surveillance, such as through wastewater or the number of emergency department visits for COVID-19, when available, can also inform decision making for health officials and individuals.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date data for any county or state, visit the relevant health department website. COVID Data Tracker may display data that differ from state and local websites. This can be due to differences in how data were collected, how metrics were calculated, or the timing of web updates.\n\n<b>Archived Data Notes:</b>\n\nThis dataset was renamed from \"United States COVID-19 Community Levels by County as Originally Posted\" to \"United States COVID-19 Community Levels by County\" on March 31, 2022. \n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> Column name for county population was changed to \u201ccounty_population\u201d.

These data reflect cases among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 24, 2022, and deaths among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 3, 2022. \n\nVaccination status: A person vaccinated with a primary series had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after verifiably completing the primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series \u226514 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected.\nAdditional or booster dose: A person vaccinated with a primary series and an additional or booster dose had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after receipt of an additional or booster dose of any COVID-19 vaccine on or after August 13, 2021. For people ages 18 years and older, data are graphed starting the week including September 24, 2021, when a COVID-19 booster dose was first recommended by CDC for adults 65+ years old and people in certain populations and high risk occupational and institutional settings. For people ages 12-17 years, data are graphed starting the week of December 26, 2021, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for adolescents ages 16-17 years. For people ages 5-11 years, data are included starting the week of June 5, 2022, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for children aged 5-11 years. For people ages 50 years and older, data on second booster doses are graphed starting the week including March 29, 2022, when the recommendation was made for second boosters. Vertical lines represent dates when changes occurred in U.S. policy for COVID-19 vaccination (details provided above). Reporting is by primary series vaccine type rather than additional or booster dose vaccine type. The booster dose vaccine type may be different than the primary series vaccine type. \n** Because data on the immune status of cases and associated deaths are unavailable, an additional dose in an immunocompromised person cannot be distinguished from a booster dose. This is a relevant consideration because vaccines can be less effective in this group.\nDeaths: A COVID-19\u2013associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died; health department staff reviewed to make a determination using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources. Rates of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status are reported based on when the patient was tested for COVID-19, not the date they died. Deaths usually occur up to 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.\nParticipating jurisdictions: Currently, these 31 health departments that regularly link their case surveillance to immunization information system data are included in these incidence rate estimates: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, New York City (New York), North Carolina, Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia; 30 jurisdictions also report deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people.

Please note that these jurisdictions will not routinely send new case data after the dates indicated. As of 7/13/23, case notifications from Oregon will only include cases resulting in death.\n\n\nThis case surveillance public use dataset has 19 elements for all COVID-19 cases shared with CDC and includes demographics, geography (county and state of residence), any exposure history, disease severity indicators and outcomes, and presence of any underlying medical conditions and risk behaviors.\n\nCurrently, CDC provides the public with three versions of COVID-19 case surveillance line-listed data: this <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data-with-Ge/n8mc-b4w4\">19 data element dataset with geography</a>, a <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf\">12 data element public use dataset</a>, and a <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Restricted-Access-Detai/mbd7-r32t\">33 data element restricted access dataset</a>.\n\nThe following apply to the public use datasets and the restricted access dataset:\n- Data elements can be found on the COVID-19 case report form located at <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/pui-form.pdf\">www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/pui-form.pdf</a>.\n- Data are considered provisional by CDC and are subject to change until the data are reconciled and verified with the state and territorial data providers.\n- Some data are suppressed to protect individual privacy.\n- Datasets will include all cases with the earliest date available in each record (date received by CDC or date related to illness/specimen collection) at least 14 days prior to the creation of the current datasets. This 14-day lag allows case reporting to be stabilized and ensure that time-dependent outcome data are accurately captured.\n- Datasets are updated monthly. <br>\n- Datasets are created using CDC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/maso/policy/policy385.pdf\">Policy on Public Health Research and Nonresearch Data Management and Access</a> and include protections designed to protect individual privacy. \n<br>\n- For more information about data collection and reporting, please see\u202f<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/about-us-cases-deaths.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/about-us-cases-deaths.html.</a><br>\n- For more information about the COVID-19 case surveillance data, please see <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html\"> https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html</a><br>\n\n\n<b>Overview</b>\n\nThe COVID-19 case surveillance database includes patient-level data reported by U.S. states and autonomous reporting entities, including New York City and the District of Columbia (D.C.), as well as U.S. territories and affiliates.

Similar data are accessible from wonder.cdc.gov.\n\nEstimates of excess deaths can provide information about the burden of mortality potentially related to COVID-19, beyond the number of deaths that are directly attributed to COVID-19. Excess deaths are typically defined as the difference between observed numbers of deaths and expected numbers. This visualization provides weekly data on excess deaths by jurisdiction of occurrence. Counts of deaths in more recent weeks are compared with historical trends to determine whether the number of deaths is significantly higher than expected.\n\nEstimates of excess deaths can be calculated in a variety of ways, and will vary depending on the methodology and assumptions about how many deaths are expected to occur. Estimates of excess deaths presented in this webpage were calculated using Farrington surveillance algorithms (1). For each jurisdiction, a model is used to generate a set of expected counts, and the upper bound of the 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) of these expected counts is used as a threshold to estimate excess deaths. Observed counts are compared to these upper bound estimates to determine whether a significant increase in deaths has occurred. Provisional counts are weighted to account for potential underreporting in the most recent weeks. However, data for the most recent week(s) are still likely to be incomplete. Only about 60% of deaths are reported within 10 days of the date of death, and there is considerable variation by jurisdiction. More detail about the methods, weighting, data, and limitations can be found in the Technical Notes.", "attribution": "NCHS/DVS", "attribution_link": "https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm", "contact_email": "cdcinfo@cdc.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-09-27T19:06:05.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-04-29T20:48:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-09-27T19:05:57.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-09-27T19:06:05.000Z", "columns_name": ["Total Excess Estimate", "Excess Estimate", "Average Expected Count", "Week Ending Date", "Percent Excess Estimate", "Upper Bound Threshold", "Observed Number", "State", "Note", "Suppress", "Outcome", "Year", "Exceeds Threshold", "Type"], "columns_field_name": ["total_excess_estimate", "excess_estimate", "average_expected_count", "week_ending_date", "percent_excess_estimate", "upper_bound_threshold", "observed_number", "state", "note", "suppress", "outcome", "year", "exceeds_threshold", "type"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Checkbox", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Total excess estimate", "Excess estimate", "", "", "Percent excess estimate", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {"align": "right"}, {"view": "date"}, {}, {"align": "right"}, {"align": "right"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"view": "date", "noCommas": "true", "align": "left"}, {"align": "center"}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2021-11-17T15:21:32.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["health", "demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "NCHS", "domain_tags": ["all causes", "coronavirus", "covid-19", "deaths", "excess deaths", "mortality", "nchs", "nvss", "provisional", "puerto rico", "state", "united states", "weekly"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Email", "value": "cdcinfo@cdc.gov"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "009:020"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Public-Access-Level", "value": "public"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Geographic-Coverage", "value": "United States, Puerto Rico"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "National Center for Health Statistics"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "irregular"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Homepage", "value": "https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "009:20"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Issued", "value": "2020-04-29"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Name", "value": "National Center for Health Statistics"}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Suggested-Citation", "value": "National Center for Health Statistics.

This dataset contains archived community transmission and related data elements by county as originally displayed on the COVID Data Tracker.

An archived dataset containing weekly community transmission data by county as originally posted can also be found here: <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/dt66-w6m6\">Weekly COVID-19 County Level of Community Transmission as Originally Posted | Data | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov)</a>. \n\n<b>Related data</b>\nCDC has been providing the public with two versions of COVID-19 county-level community transmission level data: this dataset with the daily values as originally posted on the COVID Data Tracker, and an historical dataset with daily data as well as the updates and corrections from state and local health departments. Similar to this dataset, the <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-T/nra9-vzzn\">original historical dataset</a> is archived on 10/20/2022. It will continue to be publicly available but will no longer be updated. A new dataset containing historical community transmission data by county is now published weekly and can be found at: <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/dataset/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/jgk8-6dpn\">Weekly COVID-19 County Level of Community Transmission Historical Changes | Data | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov)</a>.\n\nThis public use dataset has 7 data elements reflecting community transmission levels for all available counties and jurisdictions. It contains reported daily transmission levels at the county level with the same values used to display transmission maps on the COVID Data Tracker. Each day, the dataset is appended to contain the most recent day's data. Transmission level is set to low, moderate, substantial, or high using the calculation rules below.\n\n<b>Methods for calculating county level of community transmission indicator</b>\nThe County Level of Community Transmission indicator uses two metrics: (1) total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 persons in the last 7 days and (2) percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) in the last 7 days. For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission values as low, moderate, substantial, or high (below and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7030e2.htm?s_cid=mm7030e2_w#T1_down\">here</a>). If the values for each of these two metrics differ (e.g., one indicates moderate and the other low), then the higher of the two should be used for decision-making.\n\n<b>CDC core metrics of and thresholds for community transmission levels of SARS-CoV-2</b>\n\n<b>Total New Case Rate Metric:</b> \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is calculated by adding the number of new cases in the county (or other administrative level) in the last 7 days divided by the population in the county (or other administrative level) and multiplying by 100,000. \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is considered to have a transmission level of Low (0-9.99); Moderate (10.00-49.99); Substantial (50.00-99.99); and High (greater than or equal to 100.00).\n\n<b>Test Percent Positivity Metric:</b> \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is calculated by dividing the number of positive tests in the county (or other administrative level) during the last 7 days by the total number of tests conducted over the last 7 days. \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is considered to have a transmission level of Low (less than 5.00); Moderate (5.00-7.99); Substantial (8.00-9.99); and High (greater than or equal to 10.00).\n\nIf", "attribution": "CDC COVID-19 Response", "attribution_link": "https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view", "contact_email": "eocevent394@cdc.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-05-11T21:41:48.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-08-06T15:10:05.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-05-11T21:41:48.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-10-20T00:02:27.000Z", "columns_name": ["county_name", "report_date", "cases_per_100K_7_day_count_change", "fips_code", "community_transmission_level", "percent_test_results_reported_positive_last_7_days", "state_name"], "columns_field_name": ["county_name", "report_date", "cases_per_100k_7_day_count", "fips_code", "community_transmission_level", "percent_test_results_reported", "state_name"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["County", "Date county level of community transmission indicator reported on COVID Data Tracker", "Total number of new cases per 100,000 persons within the last 7 days", "County FIPS code, zero padded", "Community Transmission Level Indicator [low, moderate, substantial, high, blank]", "Percentage of positive diagnostic and screening nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) during the last 7 days", "State"], "columns_format": [{}, {"view": "date_ymd"}, {}, {}, {}, {"precision": "2"}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2021-09-21T17:52:14.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Public Health Surveillance", "domain_tags": ["case", "community transmission", "coronavirus", "county", "covid-19", "laboratory"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Email", "value": "eocevent394@cdc.gov"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "009:020"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Public-Access-Level", "value": "public"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Temporal-Applicability", "value": "2021-08-16/2022-10-19"}, {"key": "Common-Core_References", "value": "https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-County-Level-of-Community-Transmissi/nra9-vzzn"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Geographic-Coverage", "value": "US"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "CDC"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "No longer updated (dataset archived)"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "009:20"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Name", "value": "Surveillance Review and Response Group"}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Suggested-Citation", "value": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 Response.

These data reflect cases among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 24, 2022, and deaths among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 3, 2022. \n\nVaccination status: A person vaccinated with a primary series had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after verifiably completing the primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series \u226514 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected.\nAdditional or booster dose: A person vaccinated with a primary series and an additional or booster dose had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after receipt of an additional or booster dose of any COVID-19 vaccine on or after August 13, 2021. For people ages 18 years and older, data are graphed starting the week including September 24, 2021, when a COVID-19 booster dose was first recommended by CDC for adults 65+ years old and people in certain populations and high risk occupational and institutional settings. For people ages 12-17 years, data are graphed starting the week of December 26, 2021, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for adolescents ages 16-17 years. For people ages 5-11 years, data are included starting the week of June 5, 2022, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for children aged 5-11 years. For people ages 50 years and older, data on second booster doses are graphed starting the week including March 29, 2022, when the recommendation was made for second boosters. Vertical lines represent dates when changes occurred in U.S. policy for COVID-19 vaccination (details provided above). Reporting is by primary series vaccine type rather than additional or booster dose vaccine type. The booster dose vaccine type may be different than the primary series vaccine type.\n** Because data on the immune status of cases and associated deaths are unavailable, an additional dose in an immunocompromised person cannot be distinguished from a booster dose. This is a relevant consideration because vaccines can be less effective in this group.\nDeaths: A COVID-19\u2013associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died; health department staff reviewed to make a determination using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources. Rates of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status are reported based on when the patient was tested for COVID-19, not the date they died. Deaths usually occur up to 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.\nParticipating jurisdictions: Currently, these 31 health departments that regularly link their case surveillance to immunization information system data are included in these incidence rate estimates: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, New York City (New York), North Carolina, Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia; 30 jurisdictions also report deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people.

This dataset will receive a final update on June 1, 2023, to reconcile historical data through May 10, 2023, and will remain publicly available.\n\n<b>Aggregate Data Collection Process </b>\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, data have been gathered through a robust process with the following steps: \n<ul><li>A CDC data team reviews and validates the information obtained from jurisdictions\u2019 state and local websites via an overnight data review process.</li>\n<li>If more than one official county data source exists, CDC uses a comprehensive data selection process comparing each official county data source, and takes the highest case and death counts respectively, unless otherwise specified by the state. </li>\n<li>CDC compiles these data and posts the finalized information on COVID Data Tracker. </li>\n<li>County level data is aggregated to obtain state and territory specific totals.</li>\n</ul>This process is collaborative, with CDC and jurisdictions working together to ensure the accuracy of COVID-19 case and death numbers. County counts provide the most up-to-date numbers on cases and deaths by report date. CDC may retrospectively update counts to correct data quality issues. \n\n<b>Relation to Archived Dataset</b>\nPrior to October 20, 2022, CDC collected aggregate case and death data at the state level. This data was compiled and published daily on data.cdc.gov in a dataset called <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36\">United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State over Time</a>. As of 10/20/2022, this dataset has been archived and will no longer update. \n\n<b>Methodology Changes </b>\nSeveral differences exist between the current, weekly-updated dataset and the archived version of the <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36\">United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State over Time</a> dataset: \n<ul><li><b>Source:</b>\u202fThe current Weekly-Updated Version is based on county-level aggregate count data, while the Archived Version is based on State-level aggregate count data. </li>\n<li><b>Confirmed/Probable Cases/Death breakdown:\u202f</b> While the probable cases and deaths are included in the total case and total death counts in both versions (if applicable), they were reported separately from the confirmed cases and deaths by jurisdiction in the Archived Version.\u202f In the current Weekly-Updated Version, the counts by jurisdiction are not reported by confirmed or probable status (See Confirmed and Probable Counts section for more detail).</li>\n<li><b>Time Series Frequency:</b> The current Weekly-Updated Version contains weekly time series data (i.e., one record per week per jurisdiction), while the Archived Version contains daily time series data (i.e., one record per day per jurisdiction). </li>\n<li><b>Update Frequency:</b>\u202fThe current Weekly-Updated Version is updated weekly, while the Archived Version was updated twice daily up to October 20, 2022. </li></ul>\n<b>Important note:</b> The counts reflected during a given time period in this dataset may not match the counts reflected for the same time period in the archived dataset noted above. Discrepancies may exist due to differences between county and state COVID-19 case surveillance and reconciliation efforts. \n\n<b>Confirmed and Probable Counts </b>\nIn this dataset, counts by jurisdiction are not displayed by confirmed or probable status.

This dataset includes 2017, 2016 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2017, 2016), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2013-2017, 2012-2016 estimates.

Transmission level is set to low, moderate, substantial, or high using the calculation rules below.\n\n<b>Methods for calculating county level of community transmission indicator</b>\nThe County Level of Community Transmission indicator uses two metrics: (1) total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 persons in the last 7 days and (2) percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) in the last 7 days. For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission values as low, moderate, substantial, or high (below and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7030e2.htm?s_cid=mm7030e2_w#T1_down\">here</a>). If the values for each of these two metrics differ (e.g., one indicates moderate and the other low), then the higher of the two should be used for decision-making.\n\n<b>CDC core metrics of and thresholds for community transmission levels of SARS-CoV-2</b>\n\n<b>Total New Case Rate Metric:</b> \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is calculated by adding the number of new cases in the county (or other administrative level) in the last 7 days divided by the population in the county (or other administrative level) and multiplying by 100,000. \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is considered to have transmission level of Low (0-9.99); Moderate (10.00-49.99); Substantial (50.00-99.99); and High (greater than or equal to 100.00).\n\n<b>Test Percent Positivity Metric:</b> \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is calculated by dividing the number of positive tests in the county (or other administrative level) during the last 7 days by the total number of tests resulted over the last 7 days. \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is considered to have transmission level of Low (less than 5.00); Moderate (5.00-7.99); Substa", "attribution": "CDC COVID-19 Response", "attribution_link": "https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view", "contact_email": "eocevent394@cdc.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-05-11T21:42:01.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-08-06T15:40:43.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-05-11T21:42:01.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-10-21T01:15:18.000Z", "columns_name": ["cases_per_100K_7_day_count_change", "percent_test_results_reported_positive_last_7_days", "state_name", "community_transmission_level", "date", "fips_code", "county_name"], "columns_field_name": ["cases_per_100k_7_day_count", "percent_test_results_reported", "state_name", "community_transmission_level", "date", "fips_code", "county_name"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Total number of new cases per 100,000 persons within the last 7 days", "Percentage of positive diagnostic and screening nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) during the last 7 days", "State", "Community Transmission Level Indicator [low, moderate, substantial, high, blank]", "Week ending date for the 7-day period for the case rate and the percent positivity", "County FIPS code, zero padded", "County"], "columns_format": [{}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "percentScale": "1", "precision": "2"}, {}, {}, {"view": "date"}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-01-06T19:05:28.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Public Health Surveillance", "domain_tags": ["cases", "community transmission", "coronavirus", "county", "covid-19", "laboratory"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Email", "value": "eocevent394@cdc.gov"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "009:020"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Public-Access-Level", "value": "public"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Temporal-Applicability", "value": "2020-01-22/2022-10-18"}, {"key": "Common-Core_References", "value": "https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-County-Level-of-Community-Transmissi/8396-v7yb"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Geographic-Coverage", "value": "US"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "CDC"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "No longer updated (dataset archived)"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "009:20"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Name", "value": "Surveillance Review and Response Group"}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Suggested-Citation", "value": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 Response.

A separate archived file is made available here (<a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/jgk8-6dpn\">: Weekly COVID-19 County Level of Community Transmission Historical Changes</a>) if historically updated data are desired.\n\n<b>Related data</b> \nCDC provides the public with two active versions of COVID-19 county-level community transmission level data: this dataset with the levels as originally posted (<a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/dt66-w6m6\">Weekly Originally Posted dataset</a>), updated weekly with the most recent week\u2019s data since October 20, 2022, and a historical dataset with the county-level transmission data from January 22, 2020 (<a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/jgk8-6dpn\">Weekly Historical Changes dataset</a>).  \n \n<b>Methods for calculating county level of community transmission indicator</b> \nThe County Level of Community Transmission indicator uses two metrics: (1) total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 persons in the last 7 days and (2) percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) in the last 7 days. For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission values as low, moderate, substantial, or high (below and\u202f<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7030e2.htm?s_cid=mm7030e2_w#T1_down\">here</a>). If the values for each of these two metrics differ (e.g., one indicates moderate and the other low), then the higher of the two should be used for decision-making. \n \n<b>CDC core metrics of and thresholds for community transmission levels of SARS-CoV-2</b>\n<b>Total New Case Rate Metric:</b> \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is calculated by adding the number of new cases in the county (or other administrative level) in the last 7 days divided by the population in the county (or other administrative level) and multiplying by 100,000. \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is considered to have a transmission level of Low (0-9.99); Moderate (10.00-49.99); Substantial (50.00-99.99); and High (greater than or equal to 100.00). \n \n<b>Test Percent Positivity Metric:</b> \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is calculated by dividing the number of positive tests in the county (or other administrative level) during the last 7 days by the total number of tests conducted", "attribution": "CDC COVID-19 Response", "attribution_link": "https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view?list_select_state=all_states&list_select_county=all_counties&data-type=Risk&null=Risk", "contact_email": "eocevent394@cdc.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-05-17T19:21:11.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-10-06T13:33:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-05-17T19:21:11.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-05-11T21:39:22.000Z", "columns_name": ["report_date", "fips_code", "percent_test_results_reported_positive_last_7_days", "county_name", "state_name", "community_transmission_level", "cases_per_100K_7_day_count_change"], "columns_field_name": ["report_date", "fips_code", "percent_test_results_reported", "county_name", "state_name", "community_transmission_level", "cases_per_100k_7_day_count"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Date county level of community transmission indicator reported on COVID Data Tracker", "County FIPS code, zero padded", "Percentage of positive diagnostic and screening nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) during the last 7 days", "County", "State", "Community Transmission Level Indicator [low, moderate, substantial, high, blank]", "Total number of new cases per 100,000 persons within the last 7 days"], "columns_format": [{"view": "date"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"precision": "2"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2023-02-24T16:47:57.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Public Health Surveillance", "domain_tags": ["case", "community transmission", "coronavirus", "county", "covid-19", "laboratory"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Email", "value": "eocevent394@cdc.gov"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "009:020"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Public-Access-Level", "value": "public"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Temporal-Applicability", "value": "2020-01-22/2023-05-10"}, {"key": "Common-Core_References", "value": "https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/jgk8-6dpn"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Geographic-Coverage", "value": "US"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "CDC"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "No longer updated (dataset archived)"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "009:20"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Name", "value": "Surveillance Review and Response Group"}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Suggested-Citation", "value": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 Response.

It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 36 measures: 13 for health outcomes, 9 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, and 3 for health status. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2021 or 2020 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey 2015\u20132019 estimates. The 2023 release uses 2021 BRFSS data for 29 measures and 2020 BRFSS data for seven measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours) that the survey collects data on every other year.

PLACES covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia (DC)\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. Project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2020 or 2019 data, Census Bureau 2020 or 2019 county population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2016\u20132020 or 2015\u20132019 estimates. The 2022 release uses 2020 BRFSS data for 25 measures and 2019 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening) that the survey collects data on every other year. These data can be joined with the census 2020 county boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 29 measures at the county level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software.

Vaccine receipt date used for analyses was date of most recent vaccine. Vaccination coverage estimates are based on all interviews through the current week and represent approximately the cumulative percent vaccinated by mid-week. Each week, estimates for prior weeks are recalculated using the additional interviews conducted that week (combined with all previous interviews).   Cumulative vaccination coverage estimates are suppressed when the cumulative sample size is <30 or current week sample size is <5. Vaccination intent estimates for a given week are suppressed when the sample size for that week is <30.

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category.

It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2021 or 2020 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015\u20132019 estimates. The 2023 release uses 2021 BRFSS data for 29 measures and 2020 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours) that the survey collects data on every other year. These data can be joined with the census tract 2015 boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 36 measures at the census tract level.

Although these data will continue to be publicly available, this dataset will no longer be updated.\n\n<b>Aggregate Data Collection Process\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, data were reported through a robust process with the following steps:</b><ul><li>Aggregate county-level counts were obtained indirectly, via automated overnight web collection, or directly, via a data submission process.</li><li>If more than one official county data source existed, CDC used a comprehensive data selection process comparing each official county data source to retrieve the highest case and death counts, unless otherwise specified by the state.</li><li>A CDC data team reviewed counts for congruency prior to integration. CDC routinely compiled these data and post the finalized information on COVID Data Tracker.</li><li>Cases and deaths are based on date of report and not on the date of symptom onset. CDC calculates rates in this data by using population estimates provided by the US Census Bureau Population Estimates Program (2019 Vintage).</li><li>COVID-19 aggregate case and death data were organized in a time series that includes cumulative number of cases and deaths as reported by a jurisdiction on a given date.  New case and death counts were calculated as the week-to-week change in reported cumulative cases and deaths (i.e., newly reported cases and deaths = cumulative number of cases/deaths reported this week minus the cumulative total reported the week before.</li></ul>\n\nThis process was collaborative, with CDC and jurisdictions working together to ensure the accuracy of COVID-19 case and death numbers. County counts provided the most up-to-date numbers on cases and deaths by report date. Throughout data collection, CDC retrospectively updated counts to correct known data quality issues. CDC also worked with jurisdictions after the end of the public health emergency declaration to finalize county data. \n<ul><li><b>Source:</b> The weekly archived dataset is based on county-level aggregate count data</li><li><b>Confirmed/Probable Cases/Death breakdown:</b> Cumulative cases and deaths for each county are included.
