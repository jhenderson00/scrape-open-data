Although these data will continue to be publicly available, this dataset will no longer be updated.\n\nThis archived public use dataset has 11 data elements reflecting United States COVID-19 community levels for all available counties. \n\nThe COVID-19 community levels were developed using a combination of three metrics \u2014 new COVID-19 admissions per 100,000 population in the past 7 days, the percent of staffed inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients, and total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days. The COVID-19 community level was determined by the higher of the new admissions and inpatient beds metrics, based on the current level of new cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days. New COVID-19 admissions and the percent of staffed inpatient beds occupied represent the current potential for strain on the health system. Data on new cases acts as an early warning indicator of potential increases in health system strain in the event of a COVID-19 surge.\n\nUsing these data, the COVID-19 community level was classified as low, medium, or high.\n\nCOVID-19 Community Levels were used to help communities and individuals make decisions based on their local context and their unique needs. Community vaccination coverage and other local information, like early alerts from surveillance, such as through wastewater or the number of emergency department visits for COVID-19, when available, can also inform decision making for health officials and individuals.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date data for any county or state, visit the relevant health department website. COVID Data Tracker may display data that differ from state and local websites. This can be due to differences in how data were collected, how metrics were calculated, or the timing of web updates.\n\n<b>Archived Data Notes:</b>\n\nThis dataset was renamed from \"United States COVID-19 Community Levels by County as Originally Posted\" to \"United States COVID-19 Community Levels by County\" on March 31, 2022. \n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> Column name for county population was changed to \u201ccounty_population\u201d.

These data reflect cases among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 24, 2022, and deaths among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 3, 2022. \n\nVaccination status: A person vaccinated with a primary series had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after verifiably completing the primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series \u226514 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected.\nAdditional or booster dose: A person vaccinated with a primary series and an additional or booster dose had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after receipt of an additional or booster dose of any COVID-19 vaccine on or after August 13, 2021. For people ages 18 years and older, data are graphed starting the week including September 24, 2021, when a COVID-19 booster dose was first recommended by CDC for adults 65+ years old and people in certain populations and high risk occupational and institutional settings. For people ages 12-17 years, data are graphed starting the week of December 26, 2021, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for adolescents ages 16-17 years. For people ages 5-11 years, data are included starting the week of June 5, 2022, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for children aged 5-11 years. For people ages 50 years and older, data on second booster doses are graphed starting the week including March 29, 2022, when the recommendation was made for second boosters. Vertical lines represent dates when changes occurred in U.S. policy for COVID-19 vaccination (details provided above). Reporting is by primary series vaccine type rather than additional or booster dose vaccine type. The booster dose vaccine type may be different than the primary series vaccine type. \n** Because data on the immune status of cases and associated deaths are unavailable, an additional dose in an immunocompromised person cannot be distinguished from a booster dose. This is a relevant consideration because vaccines can be less effective in this group.\nDeaths: A COVID-19\u2013associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died; health department staff reviewed to make a determination using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources. Rates of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status are reported based on when the patient was tested for COVID-19, not the date they died. Deaths usually occur up to 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.\nParticipating jurisdictions: Currently, these 31 health departments that regularly link their case surveillance to immunization information system data are included in these incidence rate estimates: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, New York City (New York), North Carolina, Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia; 30 jurisdictions also report deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people.

{"resource": {"name": "Excess Deaths Associated with COVID-19", "id": "xkkf-xrst", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Effective September 27, 2023, this dataset will no longer be updated. Similar data are accessible from wonder.cdc.gov.\n\nEstimates of excess deaths can provide information about the burden of mortality potentially related to COVID-19, beyond the number of deaths that are directly attributed to COVID-19. Excess deaths are typically defined as the difference between observed numbers of deaths and expected numbers. This visualization provides weekly data on excess deaths by jurisdiction of occurrence. Counts of deaths in more recent weeks are compared with historical trends to determine whether the number of deaths is significantly higher than expected.\n\nEstimates of excess deaths can be calculated in a variety of ways, and will vary depending on the methodology and assumptions about how many deaths are expected to occur. Estimates of excess deaths presented in this webpage were calculated using Farrington surveillance algorithms (1). For each jurisdiction, a model is used to generate a set of expected counts, and the upper bound of the 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) of these expected counts is used as a threshold to estimate excess deaths. Observed counts are compared to these upper bound estimates to determine whether a significant increase in deaths has occurred. Provisional counts are weighted to account for potential underreporting in the most recent weeks. However, data for the most recent week(s) are still likely to be incomplete. Only about 60% of deaths are reported within 10 days of the date of death, and there is considerable variation by jurisdiction. More detail about the methods, weighting, data, and limitations can be found in the Technical Notes.", "attribution": "NCHS/DVS", "attribution_link": "https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm", "contact_email": "cdcinfo@cdc.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-09-27T19:06:05.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-04-29T20:48:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-09-27T19:05:57.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-09-27T19:06:05.000Z", "columns_name": ["Type", "Exceeds Threshold", "Year", "Total Excess Estimate", "State", "Outcome", "Excess Estimate", "Average Expected Count", "Week Ending Date", "Percent Excess Estimate", "Note", "Suppress", "Upper Bound Threshold", "Observed Number"], "columns_field_name": ["type", "exceeds_threshold", "year", "total_excess_estimate", "state", "outcome", "excess_estimate", "average_expected_count", "week_ending_date", "percent_excess_estimate", "note", "suppress", "upper_bound_threshold", "observed_number"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Checkbox", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "Total excess estimate", "", "", "Excess estimate", "", "", "Percent excess estimate", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {"align": "center"}, {"view": "date", "noCommas": "true", "align": "left"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"align": "right"}, {"view": "date"}, {}, {}, {}, {"align": "right"}, {"align": "right"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2021-11-17T15:21:32.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["health", "demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "NCHS", "domain_tags": ["all causes", "coronavirus", "covid-19", "deaths", "excess deaths", "mortality", "nchs", "nvss", "provisional", "puerto rico", "state", "united states", "weekly"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Email", "value": "cdcinfo@cdc.gov"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "009:020"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Public-Access-Level", "value": "public"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Geographic-Coverage", "value": "United States, Puerto Rico"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "National Center for Health Statistics"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "irregular"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Homepage", "value": "https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "009:20"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Issued", "value": "2020-04-29"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Name", "value": "National Center for Health Statistics"}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Suggested-Citation", "value": "National Center for Health Statistics.

This dataset contains archived community transmission and related data elements by county as originally displayed on the COVID Data Tracker. Although these data will continue to be publicly available, this dataset has not been updated since October 20, 2022. An archived dataset containing weekly community transmission data by county as originally posted can also be found here: <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/dt66-w6m6\">Weekly COVID-19 County Level of Community Transmission as Originally Posted | Data | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov)</a>. \n\n<b>Related data</b>\nCDC has been providing the public with two versions of COVID-19 county-level community transmission level data: this dataset with the daily values as originally posted on the COVID Data Tracker, and an historical dataset with daily data as well as the updates and corrections from state and local health departments. Similar to this dataset, the <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-T/nra9-vzzn\">original historical dataset</a> is archived on 10/20/2022. It will continue to be publicly available but will no longer be updated. A new dataset containing historical community transmission data by county is now published weekly and can be found at: <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/dataset/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/jgk8-6dpn\">Weekly COVID-19 County Level of Community Transmission Historical Changes | Data | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov)</a>.\n\nThis public use dataset has 7 data elements reflecting community transmission levels for all available counties and jurisdictions. It contains reported daily transmission levels at the county level with the same values used to display transmission maps on the COVID Data Tracker. Each day, the dataset is appended to contain the most recent day's data. Transmission level is set to low, moderate, substantial, or high using the calculation rules below.\n\n<b>Methods for calculating county level of community transmission indicator</b>\nThe County Level of Community Transmission indicator uses two metrics: (1) total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 persons in the last 7 days and (2) percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) in the last 7 days. For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission values as low, moderate, substantial, or high (below and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7030e2.htm?s_cid=mm7030e2_w#T1_down\">here</a>). If the values for each of these two metrics differ (e.g., one indicates moderate and the other low), then the higher of the two should be used for decision-making.\n\n<b>CDC core metrics of and thresholds for community transmission levels of SARS-CoV-2</b>\n\n<b>Total New Case Rate Metric:</b> \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is calculated by adding the number of new cases in the county (or other administrative level) in the last 7 days divided by the population in the county (or other administrative level) and multiplying by 100,000. \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is considered to have a transmission level of Low (0-9.99); Moderate (10.00-49.99); Substantial (50.00-99.99); and High (greater than or equal to 100.00).\n\n<b>Test Percent Positivity Metric:</b> \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is calculated by dividing the number of positive tests in the county (or other administrative level) during the last 7 days by the total number of tests conducted over the last 7 days. \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is considered to have a transmission level of Low (less than 5.00); Moderate (5.00-7.99); Substantial (8.00-9.99); and High (greater than or equal to 10.00).\n\nIf", "attribution": "CDC COVID-19 Response", "attribution_link": "https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view", "contact_email": "cdcinfo@cdcinquiry.onmicrosoft.com", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-02-20T20:49:33.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-08-06T15:10:05.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-02-20T20:49:33.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-10-20T00:02:27.000Z", "columns_name": ["community_transmission_level", "state_name", "county_name", "report_date", "cases_per_100K_7_day_count_change", "fips_code", "percent_test_results_reported_positive_last_7_days"], "columns_field_name": ["community_transmission_level", "state_name", "county_name", "report_date", "cases_per_100k_7_day_count", "fips_code", "percent_test_results_reported"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Community Transmission Level Indicator [low, moderate, substantial, high, blank]", "State", "County", "Date county level of community transmission indicator reported on COVID Data Tracker", "Total number of new cases per 100,000 persons within the last 7 days", "County FIPS code, zero padded", "Percentage of positive diagnostic and screening nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) during the last 7 days"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {"view": "date_ymd"}, {}, {}, {"precision": "2"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2021-09-21T17:52:14.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Public Health Surveillance", "domain_tags": ["case", "community transmission", "coronavirus", "county", "covid-19", "laboratory"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Email", "value": "cdcinfo@cdcinquiry.onmicrosoft.com"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "009:020"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Public-Access-Level", "value": "public"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Temporal-Applicability", "value": "2021-08-16/2022-10-19"}, {"key": "Common-Core_References", "value": "https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-County-Level-of-Community-Transmissi/nra9-vzzn"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Geographic-Coverage", "value": "US"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "CDC"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "No longer updated (dataset archived)"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "009:20"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Name", "value": "CDC-INFO"}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Suggested-Citation", "value": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 Response.

These data reflect cases among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 24, 2022, and deaths among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 3, 2022. \n\nVaccination status: A person vaccinated with a primary series had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after verifiably completing the primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series \u226514 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected.\nAdditional or booster dose: A person vaccinated with a primary series and an additional or booster dose had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after receipt of an additional or booster dose of any COVID-19 vaccine on or after August 13, 2021. For people ages 18 years and older, data are graphed starting the week including September 24, 2021, when a COVID-19 booster dose was first recommended by CDC for adults 65+ years old and people in certain populations and high risk occupational and institutional settings. For people ages 12-17 years, data are graphed starting the week of December 26, 2021, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for adolescents ages 16-17 years. For people ages 5-11 years, data are included starting the week of June 5, 2022, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for children aged 5-11 years. For people ages 50 years and older, data on second booster doses are graphed starting the week including March 29, 2022, when the recommendation was made for second boosters. Vertical lines represent dates when changes occurred in U.S. policy for COVID-19 vaccination (details provided above). Reporting is by primary series vaccine type rather than additional or booster dose vaccine type. The booster dose vaccine type may be different than the primary series vaccine type.\n** Because data on the immune status of cases and associated deaths are unavailable, an additional dose in an immunocompromised person cannot be distinguished from a booster dose. This is a relevant consideration because vaccines can be less effective in this group.\nDeaths: A COVID-19\u2013associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died; health department staff reviewed to make a determination using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources. Rates of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status are reported based on when the patient was tested for COVID-19, not the date they died. Deaths usually occur up to 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.\nParticipating jurisdictions: Currently, these 31 health departments that regularly link their case surveillance to immunization information system data are included in these incidence rate estimates: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, New York City (New York), North Carolina, Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia; 30 jurisdictions also report deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people.

Similar data are accessible from wonder.cdc.gov.\n\nThis visualization provides weekly data on the number of deaths by jurisdiction of occurrence and cause of death. Counts of deaths in more recent weeks can be compared with counts from earlier years to determine if the number is higher than expected. Selected causes of death are shown, based on analyses of the most prevalent comorbid conditions reported on death certificates where COVID-19 was listed as a cause of death (see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities). Cause of death counts are based on the underlying cause of death, and presented for Respiratory diseases, Circulatory diseases, Malignant neoplasms, and Alzheimer disease and dementia.

This dataset will receive a final update on June 1, 2023, to reconcile historical data through May 10, 2023, and will remain publicly available.\n\n<b>Aggregate Data Collection Process </b>\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, data have been gathered through a robust process with the following steps: \n<ul><li>A CDC data team reviews and validates the information obtained from jurisdictions\u2019 state and local websites via an overnight data review process.</li>\n<li>If more than one official county data source exists, CDC uses a comprehensive data selection process comparing each official county data source, and takes the highest case and death counts respectively, unless otherwise specified by the state. </li>\n<li>CDC compiles these data and posts the finalized information on COVID Data Tracker. </li>\n<li>County level data is aggregated to obtain state and territory specific totals.</li>\n</ul>This process is collaborative, with CDC and jurisdictions working together to ensure the accuracy of COVID-19 case and death numbers. County counts provide the most up-to-date numbers on cases and deaths by report date. CDC may retrospectively update counts to correct data quality issues. \n\n<b>Relation to Archived Dataset</b>\nPrior to October 20, 2022, CDC collected aggregate case and death data at the state level. This data was compiled and published daily on data.cdc.gov in a dataset called <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36\">United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State over Time</a>. As of 10/20/2022, this dataset has been archived and will no longer update. \n\n<b>Methodology Changes </b>\nSeveral differences exist between the current, weekly-updated dataset and the archived version of the <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36\">United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State over Time</a> dataset: \n<ul><li><b>Source:</b>\u202fThe current Weekly-Updated Version is based on county-level aggregate count data, while the Archived Version is based on State-level aggregate count data. </li>\n<li><b>Confirmed/Probable Cases/Death breakdown:\u202f</b> While the probable cases and deaths are included in the total case and total death counts in both versions (if applicable), they were reported separately from the confirmed cases and deaths by jurisdiction in the Archived Version.\u202f In the current Weekly-Updated Version, the counts by jurisdiction are not reported by confirmed or probable status (See Confirmed and Probable Counts section for more detail).</li>\n<li><b>Time Series Frequency:</b> The current Weekly-Updated Version contains weekly time series data (i.e., one record per week per jurisdiction), while the Archived Version contains daily time series data (i.e., one record per day per jurisdiction). </li>\n<li><b>Update Frequency:</b>\u202fThe current Weekly-Updated Version is updated weekly, while the Archived Version was updated twice daily up to October 20, 2022. </li></ul>\n<b>Important note:</b> The counts reflected during a given time period in this dataset may not match the counts reflected for the same time period in the archived dataset noted above. Discrepancies may exist due to differences between county and state COVID-19 case surveillance and reconciliation efforts. \n\n<b>Confirmed and Probable Counts </b>\nIn this dataset, counts by jurisdiction are not displayed by confirmed or probable status. Instead, confirmed and probable cases and deaths are included in the Total Cases and Total Deaths columns, when available.

Counts for the most recent final annual data are provided for comparison. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia as of the date specified and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Provisional counts are often incomplete and causes of death may be pending investigation resulting in an underestimate relative to final counts. To address this, methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays by generating a set of predicted provisional counts.\n\nSeveral data quality metrics, including the percent completeness in overall death reporting, percentage of deaths with cause of death pending further investigation, and the percentage of drug overdose deaths with specific drugs or drug classes reported are included to aid in interpretation of provisional data as these measures are related to the accuracy of provisional counts. Reporting of the specific drugs and drug classes involved in drug overdose deaths varies by jurisdiction, and comparisons of death rates involving specific drugs across selected jurisdictions should not be made. Provisional data presented will be updated on a monthly basis as additional records are received.\n\nFor more information please visit: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm", "attribution": "National Center for Health Statistics", "attribution_link": "https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm", "contact_email": "cdcinfo@cdc.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-04-17T12:37:12.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-03-06T19:13:01.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-04-17T12:37:04.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-04-17T12:37:12.000Z", "columns_name": ["Indicator", "Year", "Percent Pending Investigation", "State", "Footnote", "Data Value", "State Name", "Month", "Footnote Symbol", "Predicted Value", "Period", "Percent Complete"], "columns_field_name": ["indicator", "year", "percent_pending_investigation", "state", "footnote", "data_value", "state_name", "month", "footnote_symbol", "predicted_value", "period", "percent_complete"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ",", "align": "right"}, {}, {}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ",", "align": "right"}, {}, {}, {}, {"align": "right"}, {}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ",", "align": "right"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-04-17T15:47:04.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "public safety", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "NCHS", "domain_tags": ["cocaine", "deaths", "drug", "drug overdose", "heroin", "methadone", "monthly", "mortality", "nchs", "nvss", "opiate", "opioid", "provisional", "psychostimulants", "state", "united states", "vsrr"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Email", "value": "cdcinfo@cdc.gov"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "009:020"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Public-Access-Level", "value": "public"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Temporal-Applicability", "value": "2015-01-01/2023-11-31"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Geographic-Coverage", "value": "United States"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "National Center for Health Statistics"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "R/P1M"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Homepage", "value": "https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "009:20"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Issued", "value": "2018-03-06"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Name", "value": "National Center for Health Statistics"}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Suggested-Citation", "value": " National Center for Health Statistics.

This dataset includes 2017, 2016 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2017, 2016), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2013-2017, 2012-2016 estimates. Because some questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS, there are 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, pap tests, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleep less than 7 hours) from the 2016 BRFSS that are the same in the 2019 release as the previous 2018 release.

Although these data will continue to be publicly available, this dataset has not been updated since October 20, 2022. An archived dataset containing weekly historical community transmission data by county can also be found here: <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/jgk8-6dpn\">Weekly COVID-19 County Level of Community Transmission Historical Changes | Data | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov)</a>. \n\n<b>Related data</b>\nCDC has been providing the public with two versions of COVID-19 county-level community transmission level data: this historical dataset with the daily county-level transmission data from January 22, 2020, and a dataset with the daily values as originally posted on the COVID Data Tracker. Similar to this dataset, the <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-T/nra9-vzzn\">original dataset</a> with daily data as posted is archived on 10/20/2022. It will continue to be publicly available but will no longer be updated. A new dataset containing community transmission data by county as originally posted is now published weekly and can be found at: <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/dataset/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/dt66-w6m6\">Weekly COVID-19 County Level of Community Transmission as Originally Posted | Data | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov)</a>.\n\nThis public use dataset has 7 data elements reflecting historical data for community transmission levels for all available counties and jurisdictions. It contains historical data for the county level of community transmission and includes updated data submitted by states and jurisdictions. Each day, the dataset was updated to include the most recent days\u2019 data and incorporate any historical changes made by jurisdictions. This dataset includes data since January 22, 2020. Transmission level is set to low, moderate, substantial, or high using the calculation rules below.\n\n<b>Methods for calculating county level of community transmission indicator</b>\nThe County Level of Community Transmission indicator uses two metrics: (1) total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 persons in the last 7 days and (2) percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) in the last 7 days. For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission values as low, moderate, substantial, or high (below and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7030e2.htm?s_cid=mm7030e2_w#T1_down\">here</a>). If the values for each of these two metrics differ (e.g., one indicates moderate and the other low), then the higher of the two should be used for decision-making.\n\n<b>CDC core metrics of and thresholds for community transmission levels of SARS-CoV-2</b>\n\n<b>Total New Case Rate Metric:</b> \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is calculated by adding the number of new cases in the county (or other administrative level) in the last 7 days divided by the population in the county (or other administrative level) and multiplying by 100,000. \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is considered to have transmission level of Low (0-9.99); Moderate (10.00-49.99); Substantial (50.00-99.99); and High (greater than or equal to 100.00).\n\n<b>Test Percent Positivity Metric:</b> \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is calculated by dividing the number of positive tests in the county (or other administrative level) during the last 7 days by the total number of tests resulted over the last 7 days. \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is considered to have transmission level of Low (less than 5.00); Moderate (5.00-7.99); Substa", "attribution": "CDC COVID-19 Response", "attribution_link": "https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view", "contact_email": "cdcinfo@cdcinquiry.onmicrosoft.com", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-02-20T20:48:23.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-08-06T15:40:43.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-02-20T20:48:23.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-10-21T01:15:18.000Z", "columns_name": ["fips_code", "county_name", "date", "state_name", "percent_test_results_reported_positive_last_7_days", "cases_per_100K_7_day_count_change", "community_transmission_level"], "columns_field_name": ["fips_code", "county_name", "date", "state_name", "percent_test_results_reported", "cases_per_100k_7_day_count", "community_transmission_level"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["County FIPS code, zero padded", "County", "Week ending date for the 7-day period for the case rate and the percent positivity", "State", "Percentage of positive diagnostic and screening nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) during the last 7 days", "Total number of new cases per 100,000 persons within the last 7 days", "Community Transmission Level Indicator [low, moderate, substantial, high, blank]"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {"view": "date"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "percentScale": "1", "precision": "2"}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-01-06T19:05:28.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Public Health Surveillance", "domain_tags": ["cases", "community transmission", "coronavirus", "county", "covid-19", "laboratory"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Email", "value": "cdcinfo@cdcinquiry.onmicrosoft.com"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "009:020"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Public-Access-Level", "value": "public"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Temporal-Applicability", "value": "2020-01-22/2022-10-18"}, {"key": "Common-Core_References", "value": "https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-County-Level-of-Community-Transmissi/8396-v7yb"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Geographic-Coverage", "value": "US"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "CDC"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "No longer updated (dataset archived)"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "009:20"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Name", "value": "CDC-INFO"}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Suggested-Citation", "value": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 Response.

For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission values as low, moderate, substantial, or high (below and\u202f<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7030e2.htm?s_cid=mm7030e2_w#T1_down\">here</a>).

Data reported by hospitals to NHSN and included in this dataset represent aggregated counts and include metrics capturing information specific to COVID-19 hospital admissions, and inpatient and ICU bed capacity occupancy.\n\n<b>Reporting information:</b><ul><li>As of December 15, 2022, COVID-19 hospital data are required to be reported to  NHSN, which monitors national and local trends in healthcare system stress, capacity, and community disease levels for approximately 6,000 hospitals in the United States. Data reported by hospitals to NHSN represent aggregated counts and include metrics capturing information specific to hospital capacity, occupancy, hospitalizations, and admissions. Prior to December 15, 2022, hospitals reported data directly to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or via a state submission for collection in the HHS Unified Hospital Data Surveillance System (UHDSS). </li><li>While CDC reviews these data for errors and corrects those found, some reporting errors might still exist within the data. To minimize errors and inconsistencies in data reported, CDC removes outliers before calculating the metrics. CDC and partners work with reporters to correct these errors and update the data in subsequent weeks.</li><li>Many hospital subtypes, including acute care and critical access hospitals, as well as Veterans Administration, Defense Health Agency, and Indian Health Service hospitals, are included in the metric calculations provided in this report. Psychiatric, rehabilitation, and religious non-medical hospital types are excluded from calculations.  </li><li>Data are aggregated and displayed for hospitals with the same Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Certification Number (CCN), which are assigned by CMS to counties based on the CMS Provider of Services files. </li> <li>Full details on COVID-19 hospital data reporting guidance can be found here: https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/covid-19-faqs-hospitals-hospital-laboratory-acute-care-facility-data-reporting.pdf</li></ul>\n<b>Calculation of county-level hospital metrics:</b><ul><li>County-level hospital data are derived using calculations performed at the Health Service Area (HSA) level. An HSA is defined by CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics as a geographic area containing at least one county which is self-contained with respect to the population\u2019s provision of routine hospital care. Every county in the United States is assigned to an HSA, and each HSA must contain at least one hospital. Therefore, use of HSAs in the calculation of local hospital metrics allows for more accurate characterization of the relationship between health care utilization and health status at the local level.

Vaccination coverage with the updated 2023-24 COVID-19 vaccine is defined as receipt of at least one vaccination since September 14, 2023. Vaccination coverage estimates are based on all interviews through the current week and represent approximately the cumulative percent vaccinated by mid-week. Each week, estimates for prior weeks are recalculated using the additional interviews conducted that week (combined with all previous interviews). Cumulative vaccination coverage estimates are suppressed when the cumulative sample size is <30 or current week sample size is <5. Confidence Intervals (CI) describe the level of uncertainty around an estimate because a sample was taken. 95% CIs represent the range of values that would result if the data collection had been repeated many times. For a 95% confidence interval, if the sampling method is repeated many times, the true value would fall within this interval at least 95% of the time. Wider CIs reflect larger random error in estimates resulting from survey sampling. Estimates from the NIS-ACM may differ from estimates based on other data sources, and in addition to random error associated with taking a sample, are subject to errors resulting from incomplete sample frame (exclusion of households without cell phones), selection bias (survey respondents may be more likely to be vaccinated than non-respondents), and errors in self-reported vaccination status.

Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD\u201310 underlying cause-of-death codes X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined intent).\r\n\r\nEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\r\n\r\nEstimate does not meet standards of reliability or precision. Death rates are flagged as \u201cUnreliable\u201d in the chart when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less.\r\n\r\nDeath rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD\u201310 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, \u201cOther ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality\u201d (2).

The network currently includes 58 counties in 12 states, and data are collected and reported during the October 1-April 30 season each year.  In some years, additional months of data are collected.  In adults, RSV hospitalization tracking began in the 2016\u20132017 season. In children less than 18 years of age, surveillance began in the 2018\u201319 season. Because the surveillance areas and age groups included in surveillance have changed over time, trends should be interpreted with caution. Hospitalization data are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available.  In particular, case counts and rates for recent hospitalizations are subject to lag.  Lag for RSV-NET case identification and reporting might increase around holidays or during periods of increased hospitalization utilization.  As data are received each week, prior case counts and rates are updated accordingly.\nFor more information about RSV-NET, please see https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/research/rsv-net.html.", "attribution": "RESP-NET", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "pgn6@cdc.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-05-09T13:55:55.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-05-06T16:19:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-05-09T13:55:51.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-05-09T13:55:55.000Z", "columns_name": ["Race", "Month", "Rate", "Season", "State", "Age Category", "Sex"], "columns_field_name": ["race", "month", "rate", "season", "state", "age_category", "sex"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2024-04-25T20:30:45.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Public Health Surveillance", "domain_tags": ["age-adjusted rates", "age-adjusted rates by race and ethnicity", "hospitalization rate", "hospitalizations", "rate", "rates by age group", "rates by race and ethnicity", "respiratory disease", "respiratory illness", "respiratory syncytial virus", "respiratory virus response", "rsv", "rsvnet", "rsv-net", "surveillance"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Email", "value": "pgn6@cdc.gov"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "009:038"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Public-Access-Level", "value": "public"}, {"key": "Common-Core_References", "value": "https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/research/rsv-net.html"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Geographic-Coverage", "value": "RSV-NET Sites"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "CDC"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "Weekly "}, {"key": "Common-Core_Homepage", "value": "https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/research/rsv-net.html"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "009:20"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Name", "value": "RESP-NET"}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Suggested-Citation", "value": "\u201cRSV-NET: Respiratory Syncytial Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/.

PLACES is the expansion of the original 500 Cities Project and covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia (DC)\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 29 measures: 4 chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 13 health outcomes, 3 health status, and 9 on using preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2019 or 2018 data, Census Bureau 2019 or 2018 county population estimate data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015\u20132019 or 2014\u20132018 estimates. The 2021 release uses 2019 BRFSS data for 22 measures and 2018 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours a night). Seven measures are based on the 2018 BRFSS because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS.

This dataset includes data from the retired BRFSS Vision Module. From 2005-2011 the BRFSS employed a ten question vision module regarding vision impairment, access and utilization of eye care, and self-reported eye diseases. In 2013 and subsequently, one question in the core of BRFSS asks about vision: \u201cAre you blind or do you have serious difficulty seeing, even when wearing glasses?\u201d The latest data for this core question can be found in the Vision and Eye Health Surveillance System (VEHSS). VEHSS is intended to provide population estimates of vision loss function, eye diseases, health disparities, as well as barriers and facilitators to access to vision and eye care. This information can be used for designing, implementing, and evaluating vision and eye health prevention programs.

This dataset will receive a final update on June 1, 2023, to reconcile historical data through May 10, 2023, and will remain publicly available.\n\n<b>Aggregate Data Collection Process </b>\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, data have been gathered through a robust process with the following steps: \n<ul><li>A CDC data team reviews and validates the information obtained from jurisdictions\u2019 state and local websites via an overnight data review process.</li>\n<li>If more than one official county data source exists, CDC uses a comprehensive data selection process comparing each official county data source, and takes the highest case and death counts respectively, unless otherwise specified by the state. </li>\n<li>CDC compiles these data and posts the finalized information on COVID Data Tracker. </li>\n<li>County level data is aggregated to obtain state and territory specific totals.</li>\n</ul>This process is collaborative, with CDC and jurisdictions working together to ensure the accuracy of COVID-19 case and death numbers. County counts provide the most up-to-date numbers on cases and deaths by report date. CDC may retrospectively update counts to correct data quality issues. \n\n<b>Relation to Archived Dataset</b>\nPrior to October 20, 2022, CDC collected aggregate case and death data at the state level. This data was compiled and published daily on data.cdc.gov in a dataset called <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36\">United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State over Time</a>. As of 10/20/2022, this dataset has been archived and will no longer update. \n\n<b>Methodology Changes </b>\nSeveral differences exist between the current, weekly-updated dataset and the archived version of the <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36\">United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State over Time</a> dataset: \n<ul><li><b>Source:</b>\u202fThe current Weekly-Updated Version is based on county-level aggregate count data, while the Archived Version is based on State-level aggregate count data. </li>\n<li><b>Confirmed/Probable Cases/Death breakdown:\u202f</b> While the probable cases and deaths are included in the total case and total death counts in both versions (if applicable), they were reported separately from the confirmed cases and deaths by jurisdiction in the Archived Version.\u202f In the current Weekly-Updated Version, the counts by jurisdiction are not reported by confirmed or probable status (See Confirmed and Probable Counts section for more detail).</li>\n<li><b>Time Series Frequency:</b> The current Weekly-Updated Version contains weekly time series data (i.e., one record per week per jurisdiction), while the Archived Version contains daily time series data (i.e., one record per day per jurisdiction). </li>\n<li><b>Update Frequency:</b>\u202fThe current Weekly-Updated Version is updated weekly, while the Archived Version was updated twice daily up to October 20, 2022. </li></ul>\n<b>Important note:</b> The counts reflected during a given time period in this dataset may not match the counts reflected for the same time period in the archived dataset noted above. Discrepancies may exist due to differences between county and state COVID-19 case surveillance and reconciliation efforts. \n\n<b>Confirmed and Probable Counts </b>\nIn this dataset, counts by jurisdiction are not displayed by confirmed or probable status.

PLACES is the expansion of the original 500 Cities Project and covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia (DC)\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 29 measures: 4 chronic disease-related risk behaviors, 13 health outcomes, 3 health status, and 9 on using preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2019 or 2018 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015\u20132019 or 2014\u20132018 estimates.

The PLACES project is the expansion of the original 500 Cities project and covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia (DC)\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code tabulation Areas (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 27 measures: 5 chronic disease-related unhealthy behaviors, 13 health outcomes, and 9 on use of preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates  include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2018 or 2017 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2018 or 2013-2017 estimates. The 2020 release uses 2018 BRFSS data for 23 measures and 2017 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening). Four measures are based on the 2017 BRFSS because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS.

This dataset contains estimates of the prevalence of visual acuity loss and major eye diseases generated using a Bayesian meta-analytic modeling approach that combines information from multiple data sources to produce comprehensive estimates of prevalence by age, race, and gender at the national, state and county levels. These composite prevalence estimates are the primary surveillance measures developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Vision & Eye Health Surveillance System (VEHSS).  \n\nFor more information about these estimates including summary tables and maps, methods, and links to related publications visit https://www.cdc.gov/visionhealth/vehss/estimates/index.html\nTo view this data in the VEHSS interactive data visualization application, visit https://ddt-vehss.cdc.gov/ and search for \u201cVEHSS Composite Prevalence Estimate\u201d.\n\n\nVisual Acuity Loss:\nVisual acuity loss prevalence estimates represent best-corrected visual acuity in the better-seeing eye and are included in rows where Category=\u2019Measured Visual Acuity\u2019.  Rows with Subgroup = \u2018Any vision loss' represents any impairment or blindness of 20/40 or worse; rows with Subgroup = 'US-defined blindness' refers to the subset of vision loss that is 20/200 or worse.\n\n\nAge Related Macular Degeneration:\nThe age-related macular degeneration (AMD) estimates represent AMD as measured with retinal imaging examination, and are included in rows where Category = \u2018Age Related Macular Degeneration\u2019.  The Subgroup \u2018Vision threatening AMD\u2019 includes patients with geographic atrophy, wet-form AMD, or choroidal neovascularization in either eye. The Subgroup \u2018Non-vision threatening AMD\u2019 includes patients with early or intermediate dry-form AMD defined as retinal pigment epithelium abnormalities or drusen \u2265125 \u00b5m in the worse-affected eye, and do not have vision threatening AMD.\n\n\nDiabetic Retinopathy:\nThe diabetic retinopathy (DR) estimates represent DR as measured with retinal imaging examination, and are included in rows where Category=\u2019Diabetic Eye Diseases\u2019.  The Subgroup \u2018Vision threatening DR\u2019 includes patients with severe non-proliferative DR, proliferative DR, and diabetic macular edema. The Subgroup \u2018Non-vision threatening DR\u2019 is defined as patients with mild-moderate non-proliferative DR or unspecified DR, and do not have vision threatening DR.\n\n\nGlaucoma:\nVEHSS Composite Prevalence Estimates for glaucoma are forthcoming. \n\n\nAge Groups:\nThe VEHSS Composite Prevalence Estimates are available by major age groups (All ages, ages 0-17, 18-39, 40-64, 65-84, 85+) and detailed (5-year) age groups, which are indicated by the text \u201cby detailed age groups\u201d in the \u2018Indicator\u2019 field. \n\n\nPrevalence Data Type:\nThese estimates are also available as crude (Data_Value_Type = \u2018Crude Prevalence\u2019) or adjusted data (Data_Value_Type=\u2019Adjusted Prevalence).  Crude Prevalence is the estimate of the actual number and percentage of people living with each condition.  Adjusted Prevalence estimates are adjusted to match the national population by age, race/ethnicity, and gender.  Adjusted prevalence estimates can be used to help identify disparities in prevalence between geographic areas that are not explained by differences in demographic characteristics.\n\n  \nData Sources:\nData sources for VEHSS Composite Prevalence Estimates include the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the American Community Survey (ACS), the National Survey of Children\u2019s Health (NSCH), the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), Medicare Fee-For-Service claims, the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System, MarketScan commercial insurance claims, the Health Resources & Service Administration\u2019s Area Resources File, and published examination study results from the Baltimore Pediatric Eye Disease Study (BPEDS), the Chinese American Eye Study (CHES), the Eye Diseases Prevalence Research Group (EDPRG), the Los Angeles Latino E", "attribution": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "ddtpubsmailbox@cdc.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-09-21T15:47:32.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-03-25T14:44:31.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-09-21T15:47:32.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-06-21T13:38:41.000Z", "columns_name": ["GeographicLevel", "RaceEthnicityID", "AgeID", "DataValueTypeID", "ResponseID", "QuestionID", "LocationID", "Sample_Size", "Numerator", "High_Confidence_Limit", "Low_Confidence_limit", "Data_Value", "Data_Value_Type", "RiskFactorResponse", "RiskFactor", "Age", "Subgroup", "Indicator", "Category", "LocationDesc", "LocationAbbr", "YearEnd", "YearStart", "GeoLocation", "RiskFactorResponseID", "RiskFactorID", "GenderID", "CategoryID", "TopicID", "Data_Value_Footnote", "Data_Value_Footnote_Symbol", "Data_Value_Unit", "RaceEthnicity", "Gender", "Topic", "DataSource"], "columns_field_name": ["geographiclevel", "raceethnicityid", "ageid", "datavaluetypeid", "responseid", "questionid", "locationid", "sample_size", "numerator", "high_confidence_limit", "low_confidence_limit", "data_value", "data_value_type", "riskfactorresponse", "riskfactor", "age", "response", "question", "category", "locationdesc", "locationabbr", "yearend", "yearstart", "geolocation", "riskfactorresponseid", "riskfactorid", "genderid", "categoryid", "topicid", "data_value_footnote", "data_value_footnote_symbol", "data_value_unit", "raceethnicity", "gender", "topic", "datasource"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Point", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Location descriptor (National, State, County)", "Lookup identifier value for the Race/Ethnicity stratification", "Lookup identifier value for the Age stratification", "Lookup identifier value for the Data Value Type", "Lookup identifier value for the Response", "Lookup identifier value for the Question", "Lookup identifier value for the Location.

RANDS is an ongoing series of surveys from probability-sampled commercial survey panels used for methodological research at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). RANDS estimates are generated using an experimental approach that differs from the survey design approaches generally used by NCHS, including possible biases from different response patterns and sampling frames as well as increased variability from lower sample sizes. Use of the RANDS platform allows NCHS to produce more timely data than would be possible using traditional data collection methods. RANDS is not designed to replace NCHS\u2019 higher quality, core data collections. Below are experimental estimates of loss of work due to illness with coronavirus for three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19. Data collection for the three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19 occurred between June 9, 2020 and July 6, 2020, August 3, 2020 and August 20, 2020, and May 17, 2021 and June 30, 2021. Information needed to interpret these estimates can be found in the Technical Notes. RANDS during COVID-19 included a question about the inability to work due to being sick or having a family member sick with COVID-19. The National Health Interview Survey, conducted by NCHS, is the source for high-quality data to monitor work-loss days and work limitations in the United States. For example, in 2018, 42.7% of adults aged 18 and over missed at least 1 day of work in the previous year due to illness or injury and 9.3% of adults aged 18 to 69 were limited in their ability to work or unable to work due to physical, mental, or emotional problems. The experimental estimates on this page are derived from RANDS during COVID-19 and show the percentage of U.S. adults who did not work for pay at a job or business, at any point, in the previous week because either they or someone in their family was sick with COVID-19.

PLACES covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 36 measures: 13 for health outcomes, 9 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, and 3 for health status. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations.

For a 95% confidence interval, if the sampling method is repeated many times, the true value would fall within this interval at least 95% of the time. Wider CIs reflect larger random error in estimates resulting from survey sampling. Estimates from the NIS-ACM may differ from estimates based on other data sources, and in addition to random error associated with taking a sample, are subject to errors resulting from incomplete sample frame (exclusion of households without cell phones), selection bias (survey respondents may be more likely to be vaccinated than non-respondents), and errors in self-reported vaccination status. Estimates are weighted to selected sociodemographic characteristics of the U.S. population to reduce possible bias from incomplete sample frame and selection bias. National estimates include 50 states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands. The Office of Intergovernmental and External Affairs hosts 10 Regional Offices that directly serve state and local organizations; information about Regions and which states are included in each region is available at https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/iea/regional-offices/index.html. Vaccination coverage estimates are based on all interviews through the current week and represent approximately the cumulative percent vaccinated by mid-week.

This dataset provides the percentage of emergency department patient visits for the specified pathogen of all ED patient visits for the specified geographyeach part of the country that were observed for the given week from data submitted to the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP). In addition, the trend over time is characterized as increasing, decreasing or no change, with exceptions for when there areis no data available, or the data are too sparseor there are not enough data to compute a trend. These data are to provide awareness of how the weekly trend is changing for the given geographic region.\u202f \n\nNote that the reported sub-state trends are from Health Service Areas (HSA) and the data reported from the health care facilities located within the given HSA. Health Service Areas are regions of one or more counties that align to patterns of care seeking. The HSA level data are reported for each county in the HSA. \n\nFor the emergency department time series, trajectory classifications reported on for sub-state (HSA) emergency department time series, trajectory classifications are based on approximations of the first derivative (slope) of trends that are smoothed using generalized additive models (GAMs). To determine time intervals in which the slope is sufficiently changing (i.e., rate of change distinguishable from 0), 95% confidence intervals for the slope approximations are calculated and assessed. Weeks with a 95% confidence interval not containing 0 are classified as increasing if the slope estimate is positive and decreasing if the slope estimate is negative. Weeks with a 95% confidence interval containing 0 are classified as stable. In the scenario that an HSA's time series is determined to be too sparse (i.e., many weeks with percentages of 0%), a model is not fit, and the HSA is classified as \u201csparse\u201d.  \n<br>\nFor additional information, please see: <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/surveillance/respiratory-illnesses/index.html#companion-guide\"><b>Companion Guide: NSSP Emergency Department Data on Respiratory Illness</b></a>\n<br>\nUpdated once per week on Fridays.\u202f", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "nssp@cdc.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-05-10T16:08:32.000Z", "createdAt": "2023-12-15T00:58:18.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-05-10T16:08:10.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-05-10T16:08:32.000Z", "columns_name": ["hsa", "hsa_counties", "ed_trends_rsv", "week_end", "geography", "percent_visits_combined", "fips", "percent_visits_smoothed_combined", "hsa_nci_id", "percent_visits_smoothed_influenza", "percent_visits_covid", "county", "percent_visits_influenza", "ed_trends_influenza", "BuildNumber", "trend_source", "ed_trends_covid", "percent_visits_smoothed_rsv", "percent_visits_rsv", "percent_visits_smoothed_covid"], "columns_field_name": ["hsa", "hsa_counties", "ed_trends_rsv", "week_end", "geography", "percent_visits_combined", "fips", "percent_visits_smoothed", "hsa_nci_id", "percent_visits_smoothed_1", "percent_visits_covid", "county", "percent_visits_influenza", "ed_trends_influenza", "buildnumber", "trend_source", "ed_trends_covid", "percent_visits_smoothed_rsv", "percent_visits_rsv", "percent_visits_smoothed_covid"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {"view": "iso_8601_date"}, {}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2023-12-18T19:19:02.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Public Health Surveillance", "domain_tags": ["coronavirus", "covid19", "ed", "emergency department", "flu", "influenza", "national syndromic surveillance program", "ncird", "nssp", "ophdst", "respiratory syncytial virus", "respiratory-virus-response", "rsv", "rvr"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Email", "value": "nssp@cdc.gov"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "009:037"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Temporal-Applicability", "value": "2022-10-01/2023-01-27"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Geographic-Coverage", "value": "U.S."}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "R/P1W"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "009:20"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Name", "value": "National Syndromic Surveillance Program"}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Suggested-Citation", "value": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Respiratory Virus Response.

{"resource": {"name": "500 Cities: Local Data for Better Health, 2018 release", "id": "rja3-32tc", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This is the complete dataset for the 500 Cities project 2018 release. This dataset includes 2016, 2015 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations.

Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD\u201310 underlying cause-of-death codes X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined intent).\n\nEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\n\nDeath rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD\u201310 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, \u201cOther ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality\u201d (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Drug poisoning death rates may be underestimated in those instances.\n\nREFERENCES\n1. National Center for Health Statistics. National Vital Statistics System: Mortality data.

Data are weighted to represent the non-institutionalized U.S. population of children and adolescents ages 6 months \u2013 17 years and to mitigate possible bias that can result from incomplete sample frames (e.g., exclusion of households with no phone service or only landline telephones) or non-response. The NIS-CCM survey weights adjust for nonresponse and households without mobile telephones. All responses are reported by the parent or guardian for their age-eligible child or adolescent. For more information about the survey, see the NIS website at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/nis/about.html#current-surveys.    Estimates from NIS-CCM are subject to random error related to taking a sample (see definition of confidence interval below), and possible systematic errors. Systematic errors can result from incomplete sample frame (exclusion of households without cell phones), selection bias (survey respondents may be more likely to be vaccinated than non-respondents), and errors in self or parental reported vaccination status. Estimates are weighted to selected sociodemographic characteristics of the U.S. population to reduce possible bias from incomplete sample frame and selection bias. Estimates from the NIS-CCM may differ from estimates based on other data sources. Monthly estimates from NIS-CCM on this dashboard are based on proportions derived from the interviews that occurred only during the weeks assigned to the monthly analytic period. Due to sampling variability, once coverage reaches a plateau, minor fluctuations in estimates may result in coverage appearing to decrease from the month prior. These monthly estimates of vaccination coverage may differ from weekly estimates of vaccination coverage from NIS-ACM available here: https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data-research/dashboard/vaccination-trends-adults.html and https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/covidvaxview/interactive/vaccination-dashboard.html, in which estimates of coverage are calculated for weekly data collection periods using a composite estimation procedure that uses data from completed interviews from the current week combined with data from all prior weeks, and are non-decreasing over time. Estimates for vaccination intent are based on interviews conducted each respective week and are adjusted to the cumulative vaccination coverage estimate for that week.

PLACES is the expansion of the original 500 Cities Project and covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia (DC)\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 29 measures: 4 chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 13 health outcomes, 3 health status, and 9 on using preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2019 or 2018 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015\u20132019 or 2014\u20132018 estimates. The 2021 release uses 2019 BRFSS data for 22 measures and 2018 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours a night). Seven measures are based on the 2018 BRFSS because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS.

RSV vaccination coverage estimate numerators include the number of people receiving at least one dose of an RSV vaccine since July 2023, based on information that state, territorial, and local public health agencies report to CDC. Some jurisdictions may report data submitted by tribes. Estimates include persons who are deceased but received a vaccination during the current season. People receiving doses are attributed to the jurisdiction in which the person resides unless noted otherwise. Quality and completeness of data may vary across jurisdictions. RSV vaccination coverage denominators are obtained from 2020 U.S. Census Bureau population estimates. Monthly estimates shown are cumulative, reflecting all persons vaccinated from July 2023 through the end of the reporting month. Cumulative estimates include any historical data reported since the previous submission. National estimates are not presented since not all U.S. jurisdictions are currently reporting their IIS data to CDC. Jurisdictions reporting data to CDC include U.S. states, some localities, and territories. Because IIS data are intended to capture all vaccinations administered within a jurisdiction rather than a sample, standard errors were not calculated. Laws and policies regarding the submission of vaccination data to an IIS vary by state, which may impact the completeness of vaccination coverage reflected for a jurisdiction (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/policy-legislation.html). Coverage estimates based on IIS data are expected to differ from National Immunization Survey (NIS) estimates for adults (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/rsvvaxview/adults-60-coverage-intent.html). NIS estimates are based on a sample that may not be representative after survey weighting, and vaccination status is determined by survey respondent rather than vaccine records or administrations. Quality and completeness of IIS data may vary across jurisdictions. In general, NIS estimates tend to overestimate coverage due to overreporting and IIS estimates may underestimate coverage due to incompleteness of data in certain jurisdictions. IIS coverage estimates reported on jurisdictions\u2019 dashboards may use different criteria for numerators and denominators (e.g. jurisdictions may use IIS-based denominator instead of census population) and thus IIS estimates may differ from those reported on CDC\u2019s Weekly RSV Vaccination dashboard. These data include both valid and invalid doses, persons with last known addresses in the jurisdiction, and persons with unknown addresses within the jurisdiction. Data excludes people whom a provider has indicated have left the jurisdiction. RSV vaccination coverage was calculated among adults aged 60 years or older as of September 30, 2023. Number of doses administered, and coverage estimates for a given month may change over time for some jurisdictions. New York City (New York) and Philadelphia (Pennsylvania) report data separately from their respective states. New York state data exclude New York City and Pennsylvania state data exclude Philadelphia County.  Figure 2A (line graph) will not display any lines for jurisdictions whose data have not been submitted to CDC; these jurisdictions appear gray in the Figures 2B.

PLACES covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia (DC)\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2020 or 2019 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015\u20132019 estimates. The 2022 release uses 2020 BRFSS data for 25 measures and 2019 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening) that the survey collects data on every other year. These data can be joined with the census tract 2015 boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 29 measures at the census tract level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software.\nhttps://cdcarcgis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=3b7221d4e47740cab9235b839fa55cd7", "attribution": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease

PLACES covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. This dataset includes estimates for 36 measures: 13 for health outcomes, 9 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, and 3 for health status. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2021 or 2020 data, Census Bureau 2021 or 2020 county population estimate data, and American Community Survey 2017\u20132021, or 2016\u20132020 estimates.

{"resource": {"name": "Reduced Access to Care During COVID-19", "id": "th9n-ghnr", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "The Research and Development Survey (RANDS) is a platform designed for conducting survey question evaluation and statistical research. RANDS is an ongoing series of surveys from probability-sampled commercial survey panels used for methodological research at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). RANDS estimates are generated using an experimental approach that differs from the survey design approaches generally used by NCHS, including possible biases from different response patterns and sampling frames as well as increased variability from lower sample sizes. Use of the RANDS platform allows NCHS to produce more timely data than would be possible using traditional data collection methods. RANDS is not designed to replace NCHS\u2019 higher quality, core data collections. Below are experimental estimates of reduced access to healthcare for three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19. Data collection for the three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19 occurred between June 9, 2020 and July 6, 2020, August 3, 2020 and August 20, 2020, and May 17, 2021 and June 30, 2021. Information needed to interpret these estimates can be found in the Technical Notes. RANDS during COVID-19 included questions about unmet care in the last 2 months during the coronavirus pandemic. Unmet needs for health care are often the result of cost-related barriers. The National Health Interview Survey, conducted by NCHS, is the source for high-quality data to monitor cost-related health care access problems in the United States. For example, in 2018, 7.3% of persons of all ages reported delaying medical care due to cost and 4.8% reported needing medical care but not getting it due to cost in the past year. However, cost is not the only reason someone might delay or not receive needed medical care. As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, people also may not get needed medical care due to cancelled appointments, cutbacks in transportation options, fear of going to the emergency room, or an altruistic desire to not be a burden on the health care system, among other reasons. The Household Pulse Survey (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/reduced-access-to-care.htm), an online survey conducted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by the Census Bureau in partnership with other federal agencies including NCHS, also reports estimates of reduced access to care during the pandemic (beginning in Phase 1, which started on April 23, 2020). The Household Pulse Survey reports the percentage of adults who delayed medical care in the last 4 weeks or who needed medical care at any time in the last 4 weeks for something other than coronavirus but did not get it because of the pandemic. The experimental estimates on this page are derived from RANDS during COVID-19 and show the percentage of U.S. adults who were unable to receive medical care (including urgent care, surgery, screening tests, ongoing treatment, regular checkups, prescriptions, dental care, vision care, and hearing care) in the last 2 months.

Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\n Max: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category.

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/.

Data are weighted to represent the non-institutionalized U.S. population and mitigate possible bias that can result from incomplete sample frames (e.g., exclusion of households with no phone service or only landline telephones) or non-response. Survey weights were also calibrated to jurisdiction-level vaccine administration data reported to CDC for data collected before September 2023. All responses are self-reported. For more information about the survey, see the NIS website at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/nis/about.html#current-surveys.   Estimates from NIS-ACM are subject to random error related to taking a sample (see definition of confidence interval below), and to possible systematic errors. Systematic errors can result from incomplete sample frame (exclusion of households without cell phones), selection bias (survey respondents may be more likely to be vaccinated than non-respondents), and errors in self or parental reported vaccination status. Estimates are weighted to selected sociodemographic characteristics of the U.S. population to reduce possible bias from incomplete sample frame and selection bias.  Estimates from the NIS-ACM may differ from estimates based on other data sources. Monthly estimates from NIS-ACM on this dashboard are based on proportions derived from the interviews that occurred only during the weeks assigned to the monthly analytic period. Due to sampling variability, once coverage reaches a plateau, minor fluctuations in estimates may result in coverage appearing to decrease from the month prior. These monthly estimates of vaccination coverage may differ from weekly estimates of vaccination coverage from NIS-ACM available on the Vaccination Trends \u2013 Adults (cdc.gov) at https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data-research/dashboard/vaccination-trends-adults.html and the Weekly COVID-19 Vaccination Dashboard | COVIDVaxView | CDC at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/covidvaxview/interactive/vaccination-dashboard.html, in which estimates of coverage are calculated for weekly data collection periods using a composite estimation procedure that uses data from completed interviews from the current week combined with data from all prior weeks, and are non-decreasing over time. Estimates for vaccination intent are based on interviews conducted each respective week and are adjusted to the cumulative vaccination coverage estimate for that week. Estimates calculated from a sample size of <30 are not shown. Approximately 14,000-17,000 adults are surveyed each week; sample size varies by demographic subgroup. Refer to the downloadable data files for sample sizes and confidence intervals for each field. Estimates should be interpreted with caution when there is a small sample size or wide confidence interval.

{"resource": {"name": "Rates of COVID-19 Cases or Deaths by Age Group and Vaccination Status and Second Booster Dose", "id": "ukww-au2k", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Data for CDC\u2019s COVID Data Tracker site on Rates of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by Vaccination Status.\nClick 'More' for important dataset description and footnotes\n\nDataset and data visualization details:\nThese data were posted on October 21, 2022, archived on November 18, 2022, and revised on February 22, 2023. These data reflect cases among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 24, 2022, and deaths among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 3, 2022. \n\nVaccination status: A person vaccinated with a primary series had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after verifiably completing the primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series \u226514 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected.\nAdditional or booster dose: A person vaccinated with a primary series and an additional or booster dose had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after receipt of an additional or booster dose of any COVID-19 vaccine on or after August 13, 2021. For people ages 18 years and older, data are graphed starting the week including September 24, 2021, when a COVID-19 booster dose was first recommended by CDC for adults 65+ years old and people in certain populations and high risk occupational and institutional settings. For people ages 12-17 years, data are graphed starting the week of December 26, 2021, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for adolescents ages 16-17 years. For people ages 5-11 years, data are included starting the week of June 5, 2022, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for children aged 5-11 years. For people ages 50 years and older, data on second booster doses are graphed starting the week including March 29, 2022, when the recommendation was made for second boosters. Vertical lines represent dates when changes occurred in U.S. policy for COVID-19 vaccination (details provided above). Reporting is by primary series vaccine type rather than additional or booster dose vaccine type. The booster dose vaccine type may be different than the primary series vaccine type.\n** Because data on the immune status of cases and associated deaths are unavailable, an additional dose in an immunocompromised person cannot be distinguished from a booster dose. This is a relevant consideration because vaccines can be less effective in this group.\nDeaths: A COVID-19\u2013associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died; health department staff reviewed to make a determination using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources. Rates of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status are reported based on when the patient was tested for COVID-19, not the date they died. Deaths usually occur up to 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.\nParticipating jurisdictions: Currently, these 31 health departments that regularly link their case surveillance to immunization information system data are included in these incidence rate estimates: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, New York City (New York), North Carolina, Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia; 30 jurisdictions also report deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people. These jurisdictions represent 72% of the total U.S. population and all ten of the Health and Human Services Regions.

Estimates less than 10 are suppressed. These early model-based provisional estimates were generated using a multi-stage hierarchical Bayesian modeling process to generate smoothed estimates of the weekly numbers of death, accounting for reporting lags. These estimates are based on several assumptions about how the reporting lags have changed in recent months across different jurisdictions, and the resulting estimates differ from other sources of provisional mortality data.  For now, these estimates should be considered highly uncertain until further evaluations can be done to determine the validity of these assumptions about timeliness. The true patterns in reporting lags will not be known until data are finalized, typically 11\u201312 months after the end of the calendar year. Importantly, these estimates are not a replacement for monthly provisional drug overdose death counts, or quarterly provisional mortality estimates.

This data is already available on other websites, but this chart brings the information together into one view for comparison.  You can find additional information on the Accelerated and Advance Payments at the following links: \n\nFact Sheet: https://www.cms.gov/files/document/Accelerated-and-Advanced-Payments-Fact-Sheet.pdf; \n\nZip file on providers in each state: https://www.cms.gov/files/zip/accelerated-payment-provider-details-state.zip\n\nMedicare Accelerated and Advance Payments State-by-State information and by Provider Type: https://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-accelerated-and-advance-payments-state.pdf.\n\nThis file was assembled by HHS via CMS, HRSA and reviewed by leadership and compares the HHS Provider Relief Fund and the CMS Accelerated and Advance Payments by State and provider as of December 4, 2020.  \n\nHHS Provider Relief Fund \nPresident Trump is providing support to healthcare providers fighting the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic through the bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, & Economic Security Act and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, which provide a total of $175 billion for relief funds to hospitals and other healthcare providers on the front lines of the COVID-19 response. This funding supports healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19 and ensures uninsured Americans can get treatment for COVID-19. HHS is distributing this Provider Relief Fund money and these payments do not need to be repaid.\nThe Department allocated $50 billion of the Provider Relief Fund for general distribution to Medicare facilities and providers impacted by COVID-19, based on eligible providers' net reimbursement. It allocated another $22 billion to providers in areas particularly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, rural providers, and providers who serve low-income populations and uninsured Americans.  HHS will be allocating the remaining funds in the near future.\n  \nAs part of the Provider Relief Fund distribution, all providers have 45 days to attest that they meet certain criteria to keep the funding they received, including public disclosure.  As of May 15, 2020, there has been a total of $34 billion in attested payments.  The chart only includes those providers that have attested to the payments by that date.  We will continue to update this information and add the additional providers and payments once their attestation is complete. \n\nCMS Accelerated and Advance Payments Program\nOn March 28, 2020, to increase cash flow to providers of services and suppliers impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) expanded the Accelerated and Advance Payment Program to a broader group of Medicare Part A providers and Part B suppliers. Beginning on April 26, 2020, CMS stopped accepting new applications for the Advance Payment Program, and CMS began reevaluating all pending and new applications for Accelerated Payments in light of the availability of direct payments made through HHS\u2019s Provider Relief Fund.\n\nSince expanding the AAP program on March 28, 2020, CMS approved over 21,000 applications totaling $59.6 billion in payments to Part A providers, which includes hospitals, through May 18, 2020. For Part B suppliers\u2014including doctors, non-physician practitioners and durable medical equipment suppliers\u2014 during the same time period, CMS approved almost 24,000 applications advancing $40.4 billion in payments. The AAP program is not a grant, and providers and suppliers are required to repay the loan.\n\nCMS has published AAP data, as required by the Continuing Appropriations and Other Extensions Act of 2021, on this website: https://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-medicare-accelerated-and-advance-payments-program-covid-19-public-health-emergency-payment.pdf", "attribution": "Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services", "attribution_link": "https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/cares-act-provider-relief-fund/index.html", "contact_email": "HIGLASServiceDesk@gdit.com", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-04-11T13:38:51.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-05-21T13:23:38.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-04-11T13:38:24.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-04-11T13:38:51.000Z", "columns_name": ["Provider Relief Fund", "State / Territory", "AAP", "Provider Name"], "columns_field_name": ["provider_relief_fund", "state_territory", "aap", "provider_name"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-05-21T16:10:46.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["health", "public safety", "economy"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Administrative", "domain_tags": ["accelerated and advance payments", "cares act", "coronavirus", "covid-19", "provider relief fund"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Email", "value": "HIGLASServiceDesk@gdit.com"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "009:020"}, {"key": "Common-Core_References", "value": "https://www.cms.gov/files/document/Accelerated-and-Advanced-Payments-Fact-Sheet.pdf"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Geographic-Coverage", "value": "US"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "HHS ASPA"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "On a continuous basis"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "009:38"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Name", "value": "Megan Worstell "}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.cdc.gov", "license": "Public Domain U.S. Government"}, "permalink": "https://data.cdc.gov/d/v2pi-w3up", "link": "https://data.cdc.gov/Administrative/Provider-Relief-Fund-Accelerated-and-Advance-Payme/v2pi-w3up", "owner": {"id": "tjyw-xtku", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "HHS ASPA"}, "creator": {"id": "tjyw-xtku", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "HHS ASPA"}}

The number of unvaccinated persons each MMWR week was estimated by subtracting the cumulative number of vaccinated (all products) and partially vaccinated persons (all products) from the respective population totals for each jurisdiction and age group. \nContinuity correction: A continuity correction has been applied to the denominators by capping the percent population coverage at 95%.

These figures accompany this report by presenting information on potentially excess deaths in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas at the state level. They also add additional years of data and options for selecting different age ranges and benchmarks.\r\n\r\nPotentially excess deaths are defined in MMWR Surveillance Summary 66(No. SS-1):1-8 as deaths that exceed the numbers that would be expected if the death rates of states with the lowest rates (benchmarks) occurred across all states. They are calculated by subtracting expected deaths for specific benchmarks from observed deaths.\r\n\r\nNot all potentially excess deaths can be prevented; some areas might have characteristics that predispose them to higher rates of death. However, many potentially excess deaths might represent deaths that could be prevented through improved public health programs that support healthier behaviors and neighborhoods or better access to health care services.\r\n\r\nMortality data for U.S. residents come from the National Vital Statistics System.

COVID-19 vaccination coverage estimate numerators include the number of people receiving at least one dose of the updated 2023-24 COVID-19 vaccine since September 2023, based on information that state, territorial, and local public health agencies report to CDC. Some jurisdictions may report data submitted by tribes. Estimates include persons who are deceased but received a vaccination since September 2023. People receiving doses are attributed to the jurisdiction in which the person resides unless noted otherwise. Quality and completeness of data may vary across jurisdictions. COVID-19 vaccination coverage denominators are obtained from 2020 U.S. Census Bureau population estimates. Monthly estimates shown are cumulative, reflecting all persons vaccinated from September 2023 through a given month. Cumulative estimates include any historical data reported since the previous submission. National estimates are not presented since not all U.S. jurisdictions are currently reporting their IIS data to CDC. Jurisdictions reporting data to CDC include U.S. states, some localities, and territories. Because IIS data are intended to capture all vaccinations administered within a jurisdiction rather than a sample, standard errors were not calculated. Laws and policies regarding the submission of vaccination data to an IIS vary by state, which may impact the completeness of vaccination coverage reflected for a jurisdiction (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/policy-legislation.html). Coverage estimates based on IIS data are expected to differ from National Immunization Survey (NIS) estimates for children (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/covidvaxview/interactive/children-coverage-vaccination.html) and adults (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/covidvaxview/interactive/adult-coverage-vaccination.html) because NIS estimates are based on a sample that may not be representative after survey weighting and vaccination status is determined by survey respondent rather than vaccine records or administrations, and quality and completeness of IIS data may vary across jurisdictions. In general, NIS estimates tend to overestimate coverage due to overreporting and IIS estimates may underestimate coverage due to incompleteness of data in certain jurisdictions. These data include both valid and invalid doses, persons with last known addresses in the jurisdiction, and persons with unknown addresses within the jurisdiction. Data excludes people whom a provider has indicated have left the jurisdiction. A period in time assessment is used to calculate COVID-19 vaccination coverage which requires all individuals to be at least 6 months old by October 1, 2023. Number of doses administered and coverage estimates for a given month may change over time for some jurisdictions. Figure 4A and 4C (line graph) will not display any lines for jurisdictions whose data have not been submitted to CDC; these jurisdictions appear gray in the Figures 4B and 4D.

This dataset includes 2015, 2014 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2015, 2014), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2011-2015, 2010-2014 estimates. Because some questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS, there are 7 measures from the 2014 BRFSS that are the same in the 2017 release as the previous 2016 release.

Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years between 2000 and 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published. Data on age-adjusted death rates prior to 1999 are taken from historical data (see References below).\n\nLife expectancy data are available up to 2017. Due to changes in categories of race used in publications, data are not available for the black population consistently before 1968, and not at all before 1960.

{"resource": {"name": "2020-2021 Nationwide Blood Donor Seroprevalence Survey Combined Infection- and Vaccination-Induced Seroprevalence Estimates", "id": "wi5c-cscz", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "CDC is collaborating with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Vitalant Research Institute (VRI), Westat Inc., and numerous blood collection organizations across the United States to conduct a nationwide COVID-19 seroprevalence survey of blood donors. This is the largest nationwide COVID-19 seroprevalence survey to date. De-identified blood samples are tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to better understand the percentage of people in the United States who have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and to track how this percentage changes over time. Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccines currently used in the United States result in production of anti-spike (anti-S) antibodies but only infection results in production of anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) antibodies. Combined seroprevalence estimates the proportion of the population with evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 vaccination, or both. It estimates the proportion of the population with some presumed protection against infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. The term \u201ccombined seroprevalence\u201d refers to the combined infection- and vaccination-induced SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalences. This is the population that has  anti-S antibodies, regardless of the presence of anti-N antibodies.\n\nThis link connects to a webpage that displays the data from the Nationwide Blood Donor Seroprevalence Survey.

COVID-19 vaccination coverage estimate numerators include the number of people receiving at least one dose of the updated 2023-24 COVID-19 vaccine since September 2023, based on information that state, territorial, and local public health agencies report to CDC. Some jurisdictions may report data submitted by tribes. Estimates include persons who are deceased but received a vaccination since September 2023. People receiving doses are attributed to the jurisdiction in which the person resides unless noted otherwise. Quality and completeness of data may vary across jurisdictions. COVID-19 vaccination coverage denominators are obtained from 2020 U.S. Census Bureau population estimates. Monthly estimates shown are cumulative, reflecting all persons vaccinated from September 2023 through a given month. Cumulative estimates include any historical data reported since the previous submission. National estimates are not presented since not all U.S. jurisdictions are currently reporting their IIS data to CDC. Jurisdictions reporting data to CDC include U.S. states, some localities, and territories. Because IIS data are intended to capture all vaccinations administered within a jurisdiction rather than a sample, standard errors were not calculated. Laws and policies regarding the submission of vaccination data to an IIS vary by state, which may impact the completeness of vaccination coverage reflected for a jurisdiction (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/policy-legislation.html). Coverage estimates based on IIS data are expected to differ from National Immunization Survey (NIS) estimates for children (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/covidvaxview/interactive/children-coverage-vaccination.html) and adults (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/covidvaxview/interactive/adult-coverage-vaccination.html)   because NIS estimates are based on a sample that may not be representative after survey weighting and vaccination status is determined by survey respondent rather than vaccine records or administrations, and quality and completeness of IIS data may vary across jurisdictions. In general, NIS estimates tend to overestimate coverage due to overreporting and IIS estimates may underestimate coverage due to incompleteness of data in certain jurisdictions. These data include both valid and invalid doses, persons with last known addresses in the jurisdiction, and persons with unknown addresses within the jurisdiction. Data excludes people whom a provider has indicated have left the jurisdiction. A period in time assessment is used to calculate COVID-19 vaccination coverage which requires all individuals to be at least 6 months old by October 1, 2023. Number of doses administered and coverage estimates for a given month may change over time for some jurisdictions. Figure 4A and 4C (line graph) will not display any lines for jurisdictions whose data have not been submitted to CDC; these jurisdictions appear gray in the Figures 4B and 4D.

Drug poisoning death rates may be underestimated in those instances.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n1. National Center for Health Statistics. National Vital Statistics System: Mortality data.

Similar data are accessible from wonder.cdc.gov.\n\nEstimates of excess deaths can provide information about the burden of mortality potentially related to COVID-19, beyond the number of deaths that are directly attributed to COVID-19. Excess deaths are typically defined as the difference between observed numbers of deaths and expected numbers. This visualization provides weekly data on excess deaths by jurisdiction of occurrence. Counts of deaths in more recent weeks are compared with historical trends to determine whether the number of deaths is significantly higher than expected.\n\nEstimates of excess deaths can be calculated in a variety of ways, and will vary depending on the methodology and assumptions about how many deaths are expected to occur. Estimates of excess deaths presented in this webpage were calculated using Farrington surveillance algorithms (1). For each jurisdiction, a model is used to generate a set of expected counts, and the upper bound of the 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) of these expected counts is used as a threshold to estimate excess deaths. Observed counts are compared to these upper bound estimates to determine whether a significant increase in deaths has occurred. Provisional counts are weighted to account for potential underreporting in the most recent weeks. However, data for the most recent week(s) are still likely to be incomplete. Only about 60% of deaths are reported within 10 days of the date of death, and there is considerable variation by jurisdiction.

PLACES covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia (DC)\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. Project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2020 or 2019 data, Census Bureau 2020 or 2019 county population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2016\u20132020 or 2015\u20132019 estimates. The 2022 release uses 2020 BRFSS data for 25 measures and 2019 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening) that the survey collects data on every other year. These data can be joined with the census 2020 county boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 29 measures at the county level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software.

Vaccine receipt date used for analyses was date of most recent vaccine. Vaccination coverage estimates are based on all interviews through the current week and represent approximately the cumulative percent vaccinated by mid-week. Each week, estimates for prior weeks are recalculated using the additional interviews conducted that week (combined with all previous interviews). Cumulative vaccination coverage estimates are suppressed when the cumulative sample size is <30 or current week sample size is <5. Vaccination intent estimates for a given week are suppressed when the sample size for that week is <30. Confidence Intervals (CI) describe the level of uncertainty around an estimate because a sample was taken. 95% CIs represent the range of values that would result if the data collection had been repeated many times. For a 95% confidence interval, if the sampling method is repeated many times, the true value would fall within this interval at least 95% of the time. Wider CIs reflect larger random error in estimates resulting from survey sampling. Estimates from the NIS may differ from estimates based on other data sources, and in addition to random error associated with taking a sample, are subject to errors resulting from incomplete sample frame (exclusion of households without cell phones), selection bias (survey respondents may be more likely to be vaccinated than non-respondents), and errors in self or parental reported vaccination status.

Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2021 or 2020 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015\u20132019 estimates. The 2023 release uses 2021 BRFSS data for 29 measures and 2020 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours) that the survey collects data on every other year. These data can be joined with the census tract 2015 boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 36 measures at the census tract level.

Data on United States exclude counts from US territories.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThese are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues.

United States death counts and rates include the 50 states, plus the District of Columbia.\n\nDeaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, coded to ICD\u201310 code U07.1. Number of deaths reported in this file are the total number of COVID-19 deaths received and coded as of the date of analysis and may not represent all deaths that occurred in that period. Counts of deaths occurring before or after the reporting period are not included in the file.\n\nData during recent periods are incomplete because of the lag in time between when the death occurred and when the death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes. This delay can range from 1 week to 8 weeks or more, depending on the jurisdiction and cause of death.\n\nDeath counts should not be compared across jurisdictions. Data timeliness varies by state. Some states report deaths on a daily basis, while other states report deaths weekly or monthly.\n\nThe ten (10) United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regions include the following jurisdictions. Region 1: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont; Region 2: New Jersey, New York; Region 3: Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia; Region 4: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee; Region 5: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin; Region 6: Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas; Region 7: Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska; Region 8: Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming; Region 9: Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada; Region 10: Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Washington.\n\nRates were calculated using the population estimates for 2021, which are estimated as of July 1, 2021 based on the Blended Base produced by the US Census Bureau in lieu of the April 1, 2020 decennial population count. The Blended Base consists of the blend of Vintage 2020 postcensal population estimates, 2020 Demographic Analysis Estimates, and 2020 Census PL 94-171 Redistricting File (see https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology/2020-2021/methods-statement-v2021.pdf).\n\nRate are based on deaths occurring in the specified week and are age-adjusted to the 2000 standard population using the direct method (see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr70/nvsr70-08-508.pdf). These rates differ from annual age-adjusted rates, typically presented in NCHS publications based on a full year of data and annualized weekly age-adjusted rates which have been adjusted to allow comparison with annual rates. Annualization rates presents deaths per year per 100,000 population that would be expected in a year if the observed period specific (weekly) rate prevailed for a full year.\n\nSub-national death counts between 1-9 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS data confidentiality standards. Rates based on death counts less than 20 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS standards of reliability as specified in NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions (available from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_175.pdf.).", "attribution": "NCHS/DVS", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "cdcinfo@cdc.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-05-09T13:57:15.000Z", "createdAt": "2023-12-12T15:12:45.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-05-09T13:57:10.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-05-09T13:57:15.000Z", "columns_name": ["subgroup2", "subgroup1", "aa_COVID_rate_ann", "month", "group", "crude_COVID_rate_ann", "footnote", "year", "jurisdiction_residence", "COVID_deaths", "crude_COVID_rate", "data_as_of", "aa_COVID_rate"], "columns_field_name": ["subgroup2", "subgroup1", "aa_covid_rate_ann", "month", "group", "crude_covid_rate_ann", "footnote", "year", "jurisdiction_residence", "covid_deaths", "crude_covid_rate", "data_as_of", "aa_covid_rate"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Demographic subgroup 2", "Demographic subgroup 1", "Age-adjusted COVID-19 death rate - annualized", "Month of death", "Demographic characteristic", "Crude COVID-19 death rate - annualized", "Footnote", "Year of death", "Jurisdiction of residence", "Deaths involving COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1)", "Crude COVID-19 death rate", "Date of analysis", "Age-adjusted COVID-19 death rate"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2023-12-14T14:26:21.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "NCHS", "domain_tags": ["age", "age group", "coronavirus", "covid-19", "death rate", "deaths", "hhs region", "hispanic origin", "monthly", "mortality", "nchs", "nvss", "race", "sex", "united states"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Email", "value": "cdcinfo@cdc.gov"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "009:020"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Public-Access-Level", "value": "public"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Geographic-Coverage", "value": "United States"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "National Center for Health Statistics"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "R/P1W"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "009:20"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Issued", "value": "2023-12-14"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Name", "value": "National Center for Health Statistics"}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Suggested-Citation", "value": "National Center for Health Statistics.
