Although these data will continue to be publicly available, this dataset will no longer be updated.\n\nThis archived public use dataset has 11 data elements reflecting United States COVID-19 community levels for all available counties. \n\nThe COVID-19 community levels were developed using a combination of three metrics \u2014 new COVID-19 admissions per 100,000 population in the past 7 days, the percent of staffed inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients, and total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days. The COVID-19 community level was determined by the higher of the new admissions and inpatient beds metrics, based on the current level of new cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days. New COVID-19 admissions and the percent of staffed inpatient beds occupied represent the current potential for strain on the health system. Data on new cases acts as an early warning indicator of potential increases in health system strain in the event of a COVID-19 surge.\n\nUsing these data, the COVID-19 community level was classified as low, medium, or high.\n\nCOVID-19 Community Levels were used to help communities and individuals make decisions based on their local context and their unique needs. Community vaccination coverage and other local information, like early alerts from surveillance, such as through wastewater or the number of emergency department visits for COVID-19, when available, can also inform decision making for health officials and individuals.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date data for any county or state, visit the relevant health department website. COVID Data Tracker may display data that differ from state and local websites. This can be due to differences in how data were collected, how metrics were calculated, or the timing of web updates.\n\n<b>Archived Data Notes:</b>\n\nThis dataset was renamed from \"United States COVID-19 Community Levels by County as Originally Posted\" to \"United States COVID-19 Community Levels by County\" on March 31, 2022. \n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> Column name for county population was changed to \u201ccounty_population\u201d.

These data reflect cases among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 24, 2022, and deaths among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 3, 2022. \n\nVaccination status: A person vaccinated with a primary series had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after verifiably completing the primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series \u226514 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected.\nAdditional or booster dose: A person vaccinated with a primary series and an additional or booster dose had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after receipt of an additional or booster dose of any COVID-19 vaccine on or after August 13, 2021. For people ages 18 years and older, data are graphed starting the week including September 24, 2021, when a COVID-19 booster dose was first recommended by CDC for adults 65+ years old and people in certain populations and high risk occupational and institutional settings. For people ages 12-17 years, data are graphed starting the week of December 26, 2021, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for adolescents ages 16-17 years. For people ages 5-11 years, data are included starting the week of June 5, 2022, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for children aged 5-11 years. For people ages 50 years and older, data on second booster doses are graphed starting the week including March 29, 2022, when the recommendation was made for second boosters. Vertical lines represent dates when changes occurred in U.S. policy for COVID-19 vaccination (details provided above). Reporting is by primary series vaccine type rather than additional or booster dose vaccine type. The booster dose vaccine type may be different than the primary series vaccine type. \n** Because data on the immune status of cases and associated deaths are unavailable, an additional dose in an immunocompromised person cannot be distinguished from a booster dose. This is a relevant consideration because vaccines can be less effective in this group.\nDeaths: A COVID-19\u2013associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died; health department staff reviewed to make a determination using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources. Rates of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status are reported based on when the patient was tested for COVID-19, not the date they died. Deaths usually occur up to 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.\nParticipating jurisdictions: Currently, these 31 health departments that regularly link their case surveillance to immunization information system data are included in these incidence rate estimates: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, New York City (New York), North Carolina, Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia; 30 jurisdictions also report deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people.

This 14-day lag allows case reporting to be stabilized and ensure that time-dependent outcome data are accurately captured.\n- Datasets are updated monthly. <br>\n- Datasets are created using CDC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/maso/policy/policy385.pdf\">Policy on Public Health Research and Nonresearch Data Management and Access</a> and include protections designed to protect individual privacy. \n<br>\n- For more information about data collection and reporting, please see\u202f<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/about-us-cases-deaths.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/about-us-cases-deaths.html.</a><br>\n- For more information about the COVID-19 case surveillance data, please see <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html\"> https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html</a><br>\n\n\n<b>Overview</b>\n\nThe COVID-19 case surveillance database includes patient-level data reported by U.S. states and autonomous reporting entities, including New York City and the District of Columbia (D.C.), as well as U.S. territories and affiliates. On April 5, 2020, COVID-19 was added to the <a href=\"https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/search-results-year/\"> Nationally Notifiable Condition List </a> and classified as \"immediately notifiable, urgent (within 24 hours)\" by a Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) Interim Position Statement (<a href=\"https://www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/positionstatement2020/Interim-20-ID-01_COVID-19_NO.pdf\">Interim-20-ID-01</a>). CSTE updated the position statement on August 5, 2020 to clarify the interpretation of antigen detection tests and serologic test results within the case classification (<a href=\"https://www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/positionstatement2020/Interim-20-ID-02_COVID-19.pdf\">Interim-20-ID-02</a>). The statement also recommended that all states and territories enact laws to make COVID-19 reportable in their jurisdiction, and that jurisdictions conducting surveillance should submit case notifications to CDC. COVID-19 case surveillance data collected by jurisdictions are shared voluntarily with CDC.\nFor more information, visit: \n<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/action/stories/covid-19-response.html\">NNDSS Supports the COVID-19 Response | CDC</a>.<br>\n\n\n<b>COVID-19 Case Reports</b>\n\nCOVID-19 case reports are routinely", "attribution": "CDC Data, Analytics and Visualization Task Force", "attribution_link": "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/index.html", "contact_email": "eocevent394@cdc.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-05T18:49:35.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-02-03T16:17:22.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-05T16:13:35.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-06-05T18:49:35.000Z", "columns_name": ["icu_yn", "ethnicity", "case_month", "race", "age_group", "hosp_yn", "exposure_yn", "process", "case_positive_specimen_interval", "state_fips_code", "case_onset_interval", "county_fips_code", "res_county", "symptom_status", "underlying_conditions_yn", "sex", "res_state", "current_status", "death_yn"], "columns_field_name": ["icu_yn", "ethnicity", "case_month", "race", "age_group", "hosp_yn", "exposure_yn", "process", "case_positive_specimen", "state_fips_code", "case_onset_interval", "county_fips_code", "res_county", "symptom_status", "underlying_conditions_yn", "sex", "res_state", "current_status", "death_yn"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Was the patient admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU)?

Excess deaths are typically defined as the difference between observed numbers of deaths and expected numbers. This visualization provides weekly data on excess deaths by jurisdiction of occurrence. Counts of deaths in more recent weeks are compared with historical trends to determine whether the number of deaths is significantly higher than expected.\n\nEstimates of excess deaths can be calculated in a variety of ways, and will vary depending on the methodology and assumptions about how many deaths are expected to occur. Estimates of excess deaths presented in this webpage were calculated using Farrington surveillance algorithms (1). For each jurisdiction, a model is used to generate a set of expected counts, and the upper bound of the 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) of these expected counts is used as a threshold to estimate excess deaths. Observed counts are compared to these upper bound estimates to determine whether a significant increase in deaths has occurred. Provisional counts are weighted to account for potential underreporting in the most recent weeks. However, data for the most recent week(s) are still likely to be incomplete. Only about 60% of deaths are reported within 10 days of the date of death, and there is considerable variation by jurisdiction. More detail about the methods, weighting, data, and limitations can be found in the Technical Notes.", "attribution": "NCHS/DVS", "attribution_link": "https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm", "contact_email": "cdcinfo@cdc.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-28T20:19:17.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-04-29T20:48:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-28T20:19:11.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-06-28T20:19:17.000Z", "columns_name": ["Total Excess Estimate", "Excess Estimate", "Average Expected Count", "Week Ending Date", "Percent Excess Estimate", "Upper Bound Threshold", "Observed Number", "State", "Note", "Suppress", "Outcome", "Year", "Exceeds Threshold", "Type"], "columns_field_name": ["total_excess_estimate", "excess_estimate", "average_expected_count", "week_ending_date", "percent_excess_estimate", "upper_bound_threshold", "observed_number", "state", "note", "suppress", "outcome", "year", "exceeds_threshold", "type"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Checkbox", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Total excess estimate", "Excess estimate", "", "", "Percent excess estimate", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {"align": "right"}, {"view": "date"}, {}, {"align": "right"}, {"align": "right"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"view": "date", "noCommas": "true", "align": "left"}, {"align": "center"}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2021-11-17T15:21:32.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["health", "demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "NCHS", "domain_tags": ["all causes", "coronavirus", "covid-19", "deaths", "excess deaths", "mortality", "nchs", "nvss", "provisional", "puerto rico", "state", "united states", "weekly"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Email", "value": "cdcinfo@cdc.gov"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "009:020"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Public-Access-Level", "value": "public"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Geographic-Coverage", "value": "United States, Puerto Rico"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "National Center for Health Statistics"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "R/P1W"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Homepage", "value": "https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "009:20"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Issued", "value": "2020-04-29"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Name", "value": "National Center for Health Statistics"}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Suggested-Citation", "value": "National Center for Health Statistics.

This dataset contains archived community transmission and related data elements by county as originally displayed on the COVID Data Tracker. Although these data will continue to be publicly available, this dataset has not been updated since October 20, 2022. An archived dataset containing weekly community transmission data by county as originally posted can also be found here: <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/dt66-w6m6\">Weekly COVID-19 County Level of Community Transmission as Originally Posted | Data | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov)</a>. \n\n<b>Related data</b>\nCDC has been providing the public with two versions of COVID-19 county-level community transmission level data: this dataset with the daily values as originally posted on the COVID Data Tracker, and an historical dataset with daily data as well as the updates and corrections from state and local health departments. Similar to this dataset, the <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-T/nra9-vzzn\">original historical dataset</a> is archived on 10/20/2022. It will continue to be publicly available but will no longer be updated. A new dataset containing historical community transmission data by county is now published weekly and can be found at: <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/dataset/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/jgk8-6dpn\">Weekly COVID-19 County Level of Community Transmission Historical Changes | Data | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov)</a>.\n\nThis public use dataset has 7 data elements reflecting community transmission levels for all available counties and jurisdictions. It contains reported daily transmission levels at the county level with the same values used to display transmission maps on the COVID Data Tracker. Each day, the dataset is appended to contain the most recent day's data. Transmission level is set to low, moderate, substantial, or high using the calculation rules below.\n\n<b>Methods for calculating county level of community transmission indicator</b>\nThe County Level of Community Transmission indicator uses two metrics: (1) total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 persons in the last 7 days and (2) percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) in the last 7 days. For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission values as low, moderate, substantial, or high (below and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7030e2.htm?s_cid=mm7030e2_w#T1_down\">here</a>). If the values for each of these two metrics differ (e.g., one indicates moderate and the other low), then the higher of the two should be used for decision-making.\n\n<b>CDC core metrics of and thresholds for community transmission levels of SARS-CoV-2</b>\n\n<b>Total New Case Rate Metric:</b> \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is calculated by adding the number of new cases in the county (or other administrative level) in the last 7 days divided by the population in the county (or other administrative level) and multiplying by 100,000. \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is considered to have a transmission level of Low (0-9.99); Moderate (10.00-49.99); Substantial (50.00-99.99); and High (greater than or equal to 100.00).\n\n<b>Test Percent Positivity Metric:</b> \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is calculated by dividing the number of positive tests in the county (or other administrative level) during the last 7 days by the total number of tests conducted over the last 7 days. \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is considered to have a transmission level of Low (less than 5.00); Moderate (5.00-7.99); Substantial (8.00-9.99); and High (greater than or equal to 10.00).\n\nIf", "attribution": "CDC COVID-19 Response", "attribution_link": "https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view", "contact_email": "eocevent394@cdc.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-05-11T21:41:48.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-08-06T15:10:05.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-05-11T21:41:48.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-10-20T00:02:27.000Z", "columns_name": ["county_name", "report_date", "cases_per_100K_7_day_count_change", "fips_code", "community_transmission_level", "percent_test_results_reported_positive_last_7_days", "state_name"], "columns_field_name": ["county_name", "report_date", "cases_per_100k_7_day_count", "fips_code", "community_transmission_level", "percent_test_results_reported", "state_name"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["County", "Date county level of community transmission indicator reported on COVID Data Tracker", "Total number of new cases per 100,000 persons within the last 7 days", "County FIPS code, zero padded", "Community Transmission Level Indicator [low, moderate, substantial, high, blank]", "Percentage of positive diagnostic and screening nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) during the last 7 days", "State"], "columns_format": [{}, {"view": "date_ymd"}, {}, {}, {}, {"precision": "2"}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2021-09-21T17:52:14.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Public Health Surveillance", "domain_tags": ["case", "community transmission", "coronavirus", "county", "covid-19", "laboratory"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Email", "value": "eocevent394@cdc.gov"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "009:020"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Public-Access-Level", "value": "public"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Temporal-Applicability", "value": "2021-08-16/2022-10-19"}, {"key": "Common-Core_References", "value": "https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-County-Level-of-Community-Transmissi/nra9-vzzn"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Geographic-Coverage", "value": "US"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "CDC"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "No longer updated (dataset archived)"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "009:20"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Name", "value": "Surveillance Review and Response Group"}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Suggested-Citation", "value": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 Response.

{"resource": {"name": "Rates of COVID-19 Cases or Deaths by Age Group and Vaccination Status and Booster Dose", "id": "d6p8-wqjm", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Data for CDC\u2019s COVID Data Tracker site on Rates of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by Vaccination Status.\nClick 'More' for important dataset description and footnotes\n\nDataset and data visualization details:\nThese data were posted on October 21, 2022, archived on November 18, 2022, and revised on February 22, 2023. These data reflect cases among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 24, 2022, and deaths among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 3, 2022. \n\nVaccination status: A person vaccinated with a primary series had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after verifiably completing the primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series \u226514 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected.\nAdditional or booster dose: A person vaccinated with a primary series and an additional or booster dose had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after receipt of an additional or booster dose of any COVID-19 vaccine on or after August 13, 2021. For people ages 18 years and older, data are graphed starting the week including September 24, 2021, when a COVID-19 booster dose was first recommended by CDC for adults 65+ years old and people in certain populations and high risk occupational and institutional settings. For people ages 12-17 years, data are graphed starting the week of December 26, 2021, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for adolescents ages 16-17 years. For people ages 5-11 years, data are included starting the week of June 5, 2022, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for children aged 5-11 years. For people ages 50 years and older, data on second booster doses are graphed starting the week including March 29, 2022, when the recommendation was made for second boosters. Vertical lines represent dates when changes occurred in U.S. policy for COVID-19 vaccination (details provided above). Reporting is by primary series vaccine type rather than additional or booster dose vaccine type. The booster dose vaccine type may be different than the primary series vaccine type.\n** Because data on the immune status of cases and associated deaths are unavailable, an additional dose in an immunocompromised person cannot be distinguished from a booster dose. This is a relevant consideration because vaccines can be less effective in this group.\nDeaths: A COVID-19\u2013associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died; health department staff reviewed to make a determination using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources. Rates of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status are reported based on when the patient was tested for COVID-19, not the date they died. Deaths usually occur up to 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.\nParticipating jurisdictions: Currently, these 31 health departments that regularly link their case surveillance to immunization information system data are included in these incidence rate estimates: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, New York City (New York), North Carolina, Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia; 30 jurisdictions also report deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people. These jurisdictions represent 72% of the total U.S. population and all ten of the Health and Human Services Regions.

This dataset will receive a final update on June 1, 2023, to reconcile historical data through May 10, 2023, and will remain publicly available.\n\n<b>Aggregate Data Collection Process </b>\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, data have been gathered through a robust process with the following steps: \n<ul><li>A CDC data team reviews and validates the information obtained from jurisdictions\u2019 state and local websites via an overnight data review process.</li>\n<li>If more than one official county data source exists, CDC uses a comprehensive data selection process comparing each official county data source, and takes the highest case and death counts respectively, unless otherwise specified by the state. </li>\n<li>CDC compiles these data and posts the finalized information on COVID Data Tracker. </li>\n<li>County level data is aggregated to obtain state and territory specific totals.</li>\n</ul>This process is collaborative, with CDC and jurisdictions working together to ensure the accuracy of COVID-19 case and death numbers. County counts provide the most up-to-date numbers on cases and deaths by report date. CDC may retrospectively update counts to correct data quality issues. \n\n<b>Relation to Archived Dataset</b>\nPrior to October 20, 2022, CDC collected aggregate case and death data at the state level.

For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission values as low, moderate, substantial, or high (below and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7030e2.htm?s_cid=mm7030e2_w#T1_down\">here</a>). If the values for each of these two metrics differ (e.g., one indicates moderate and the other low), then the higher of the two should be used for decision-making.\n\n<b>CDC core metrics of and thresholds for community transmission levels of SARS-CoV-2</b>\n\n<b>Total New Case Rate Metric:</b> \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is calculated by adding the number of new cases in the county (or other administrative level) in the last 7 days divided by the population in the county (or other administrative level) and multiplying by 100,000. \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is considered to have transmission level of Low (0-9.99); Moderate (10.00-49.99); Substantial (50.00-99.99); and High (greater than or equal to 100.00).\n\n<b>Test Percent Positivity Metric:</b> \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is calculated by dividing the number of positive tests in the county (or other administrative level) during the last 7 days by the total number of tests resulted over the last 7 days. \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is considered to have transmission level of Low (less than 5.00); Moderate (5.00-7.99); Substa", "attribution": "CDC COVID-19 Response", "attribution_link": "https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view", "contact_email": "eocevent394@cdc.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-05-11T21:42:01.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-08-06T15:40:43.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-05-11T21:42:01.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-10-21T01:15:18.000Z", "columns_name": ["cases_per_100K_7_day_count_change", "percent_test_results_reported_positive_last_7_days", "state_name", "community_transmission_level", "date", "fips_code", "county_name"], "columns_field_name": ["cases_per_100k_7_day_count", "percent_test_results_reported", "state_name", "community_transmission_level", "date", "fips_code", "county_name"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Total number of new cases per 100,000 persons within the last 7 days", "Percentage of positive diagnostic and screening nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) during the last 7 days", "State", "Community Transmission Level Indicator [low, moderate, substantial, high, blank]", "Week ending date for the 7-day period for the case rate and the percent positivity", "County FIPS code, zero padded", "County"], "columns_format": [{}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "percentScale": "1", "precision": "2"}, {}, {}, {"view": "date"}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-01-06T19:05:28.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Public Health Surveillance", "domain_tags": ["cases", "community transmission", "coronavirus", "county", "covid-19", "laboratory"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Email", "value": "eocevent394@cdc.gov"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "009:020"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Public-Access-Level", "value": "public"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Temporal-Applicability", "value": "2020-01-22/2022-10-18"}, {"key": "Common-Core_References", "value": "https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-County-Level-of-Community-Transmissi/8396-v7yb"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Geographic-Coverage", "value": "US"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "CDC"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "No longer updated (dataset archived)"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "009:20"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Name", "value": "Surveillance Review and Response Group"}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Suggested-Citation", "value": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 Response.

Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years between 2000 and 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published. Data on age-adjusted death rates prior to 1999 are taken from historical data (see References below).\n\nLife expectancy data are available up to 2017. Due to changes in categories of race used in publications, data are not available for the black population consistently before 1968, and not at all before 1960.

For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission values as low, moderate, substantial, or high (below and\u202f<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7030e2.htm?s_cid=mm7030e2_w#T1_down\">here</a>).

{"resource": {"name": "Reduced Access to Care During COVID-19", "id": "th9n-ghnr", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "The Research and Development Survey (RANDS) is a platform designed for conducting survey question evaluation and statistical research. RANDS is an ongoing series of surveys from probability-sampled commercial survey panels used for methodological research at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). RANDS estimates are generated using an experimental approach that differs from the survey design approaches generally used by NCHS, including possible biases from different response patterns and sampling frames as well as increased variability from lower sample sizes. Use of the RANDS platform allows NCHS to produce more timely data than would be possible using traditional data collection methods. RANDS is not designed to replace NCHS\u2019 higher quality, core data collections. Below are experimental estimates of reduced access to healthcare for three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19. Data collection for the three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19 occurred between June 9, 2020 and July 6, 2020, August 3, 2020 and August 20, 2020, and May 17, 2021 and June 30, 2021. Information needed to interpret these estimates can be found in the Technical Notes. RANDS during COVID-19 included questions about unmet care in the last 2 months during the coronavirus pandemic. Unmet needs for health care are often the result of cost-related barriers. The National Health Interview Survey, conducted by NCHS, is the source for high-quality data to monitor cost-related health care access problems in the United States. For example, in 2018, 7.3% of persons of all ages reported delaying medical care due to cost and 4.8% reported needing medical care but not getting it due to cost in the past year. However, cost is not the only reason someone might delay or not receive needed medical care. As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, people also may not get needed medical care due to cancelled appointments, cutbacks in transportation options, fear of going to the emergency room, or an altruistic desire to not be a burden on the health care system, among other reasons. The Household Pulse Survey (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/reduced-access-to-care.htm), an online survey conducted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by the Census Bureau in partnership with other federal agencies including NCHS, also reports estimates of reduced access to care during the pandemic (beginning in Phase 1, which started on April 23, 2020). The Household Pulse Survey reports the percentage of adults who delayed medical care in the last 4 weeks or who needed medical care at any time in the last 4 weeks for something other than coronavirus but did not get it because of the pandemic. The experimental estimates on this page are derived from RANDS during COVID-19 and show the percentage of U.S. adults who were unable to receive medical care (including urgent care, surgery, screening tests, ongoing treatment, regular checkups, prescriptions, dental care, vision care, and hearing care) in the last 2 months.

These data reflect cases among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 24, 2022, and deaths among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 3, 2022. \n\nVaccination status: A person vaccinated with a primary series had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after verifiably completing the primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series \u226514 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected.\nAdditional or booster dose: A person vaccinated with a primary series and an additional or booster dose had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after receipt of an additional or booster dose of any COVID-19 vaccine on or after August 13, 2021. For people ages 18 years and older, data are graphed starting the week including September 24, 2021, when a COVID-19 booster dose was first recommended by CDC for adults 65+ years old and people in certain populations and high risk occupational and institutional settings. For people ages 12-17 years, data are graphed starting the week of December 26, 2021, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for adolescents ages 16-17 years. For people ages 5-11 years, data are included starting the week of June 5, 2022, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for children aged 5-11 years. For people ages 50 years and older, data on second booster doses are graphed starting the week including March 29, 2022, when the recommendation was made for second boosters. Vertical lines represent dates when changes occurred in U.S. policy for COVID-19 vaccination (details provided above). Reporting is by primary series vaccine type rather than additional or booster dose vaccine type. The booster dose vaccine type may be different than the primary series vaccine type.\n** Because data on the immune status of cases and associated deaths are unavailable, an additional dose in an immunocompromised person cannot be distinguished from a booster dose. This is a relevant consideration because vaccines can be less effective in this group.\nDeaths: A COVID-19\u2013associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died; health department staff reviewed to make a determination using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources. Rates of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status are reported based on when the patient was tested for COVID-19, not the date they died. Deaths usually occur up to 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.\nParticipating jurisdictions: Currently, these 31 health departments that regularly link their case surveillance to immunization information system data are included in these incidence rate estimates: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, New York City (New York), North Carolina, Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia; 30 jurisdictions also report deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people.

Data are weighted to represent the non-institutionalized U.S. population of children and mitigate possible bias that can result from incomplete sample frames (exclusion of households with no phone service or only landline telephones) or non-response. Survey weights were also calibrated to jurisdiction-level vaccine administration data reported to CDC. All responses are reported by the parent or guardian for their age-eligible child. Estimates of vaccination coverage may differ from vaccine administration data reported at COVID Data Tracker. For more information about the survey, see the NIS website. Estimates reflect characteristics of the respondent\u2019s child, unless otherwise noted (e.g. \u201crespondent vaccination status\u201d). Estimates should be interpreted with caution when there is a small sample size or wide confidence interval.

Estimates less than 10 are suppressed. These early model-based provisional estimates were generated using a multi-stage hierarchical Bayesian modeling process to generate smoothed estimates of the weekly numbers of death, accounting for reporting lags. These estimates are based on several assumptions about how the reporting lags have changed in recent months across different jurisdictions, and the resulting estimates differ from other sources of provisional mortality data.  For now, these estimates should be considered highly uncertain until further evaluations can be done to determine the validity of these assumptions about timeliness. The true patterns in reporting lags will not be known until data are finalized, typically 11\u201312 months after the end of the calendar year. Importantly, these estimates are not a replacement for monthly provisional drug overdose death counts, or quarterly provisional mortality estimates.

{"resource": {"name": "Provider Relief Fund & Accelerated and Advance Payments", "id": "v2pi-w3up", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "We are releasing data that compares the HHS Provider Relief Fund and the CMS Accelerated and Advance Payments by State and provider as of May 15, 2020.  This data is already available on other websites, but this chart brings the information together into one view for comparison.  You can find additional information on the Accelerated and Advance Payments at the following links: \n\nFact Sheet: https://www.cms.gov/files/document/Accelerated-and-Advanced-Payments-Fact-Sheet.pdf; \n\nZip file on providers in each state: https://www.cms.gov/files/zip/accelerated-payment-provider-details-state.zip\n\nMedicare Accelerated and Advance Payments State-by-State information and by Provider Type: https://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-accelerated-and-advance-payments-state.pdf.\n\nThis file was assembled by HHS via CMS, HRSA and reviewed by leadership and compares the HHS Provider Relief Fund and the CMS Accelerated and Advance Payments by State and provider as of December 4, 2020.  \n\nHHS Provider Relief Fund \nPresident Trump is providing support to healthcare providers fighting the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic through the bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, & Economic Security Act and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, which provide a total of $175 billion for relief funds to hospitals and other healthcare providers on the front lines of the COVID-19 response. This funding supports healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19 and ensures uninsured Americans can get treatment for COVID-19. HHS is distributing this Provider Relief Fund money and these payments do not need to be repaid.\nThe Department allocated $50 billion of the Provider Relief Fund for general distribution to Medicare facilities and providers impacted by COVID-19, based on eligible providers' net reimbursement. It allocated another $22 billion to providers in areas particularly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, rural providers, and providers who serve low-income populations and uninsured Americans.  HHS will be allocating the remaining funds in the near future.\n  \nAs part of the Provider Relief Fund distribution, all providers have 45 days to attest that they meet certain criteria to keep the funding they received, including public disclosure.  As of May 15, 2020, there has been a total of $34 billion in attested payments.  The chart only includes those providers that have attested to the payments by that date.  We will continue to update this information and add the additional providers and payments once their attestation is complete. \n\nCMS Accelerated and Advance Payments Program\nOn March 28, 2020, to increase cash flow to providers of services and suppliers impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) expanded the Accelerated and Advance Payment Program to a broader group of Medicare Part A providers and Part B suppliers. Beginning on April 26, 2020, CMS stopped accepting new applications for the Advance Payment Program, and CMS began reevaluating all pending and new applications for Accelerated Payments in light of the availability of direct payments made through HHS\u2019s Provider Relief Fund.\n\nSince expanding the AAP program on March 28, 2020, CMS approved over 21,000 applications totaling $59.6 billion in payments to Part A providers, which includes hospitals, through May 18, 2020. For Part B suppliers\u2014including doctors, non-physician practitioners and durable medical equipment suppliers\u2014 during the same time period, CMS approved almost 24,000 applications advancing $40.4 billion in payments. The AAP program is not a grant, and providers and suppliers are required to repay the loan.\n\nCMS has published AAP data, as required by the Continuing Appropriations and Other Extensions Act of 2021, on this website: https://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-medicare-accelerated-and-advance-payments-program-covid-19-public-health-emergency-payment.pdf", "attribution": "Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services", "attribution_link": "https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/cares-act-provider-relief-fund/index.html", "contact_email": "HIGLASServiceDesk@gdit.com", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-07T14:55:19.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-05-21T13:23:38.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-07T14:54:31.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-06-07T14:55:19.000Z", "columns_name": ["AAP", "Provider Name", "State / Territory", "Provider Relief Fund"], "columns_field_name": ["aap", "provider_name", "state_territory", "provider_relief_fund"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-05-21T16:10:46.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["health", "public safety", "economy"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Administrative", "domain_tags": ["accelerated and advance payments", "cares act", "coronavirus", "covid-19", "provider relief fund"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Email", "value": "HIGLASServiceDesk@gdit.com"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "009:020"}, {"key": "Common-Core_References", "value": "https://www.cms.gov/files/document/Accelerated-and-Advanced-Payments-Fact-Sheet.pdf"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Geographic-Coverage", "value": "US"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "HHS ASPA"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "On a continuous basis"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "009:38"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Name", "value": "Megan Worstell "}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.cdc.gov", "license": "Public Domain U.S. Government"}, "permalink": "https://data.cdc.gov/d/v2pi-w3up", "link": "https://data.cdc.gov/Administrative/Provider-Relief-Fund-Accelerated-and-Advance-Payme/v2pi-w3up", "owner": {"id": "tjyw-xtku", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "HHS ASPA"}, "creator": {"id": "tjyw-xtku", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "HHS ASPA"}}

These figures accompany this report by presenting information on potentially excess deaths in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas at the state level. They also add additional years of data and options for selecting different age ranges and benchmarks.\r\n\r\nPotentially excess deaths are defined in MMWR Surveillance Summary 66(No. SS-1):1-8 as deaths that exceed the numbers that would be expected if the death rates of states with the lowest rates (benchmarks) occurred across all states. They are calculated by subtracting expected deaths for specific benchmarks from observed deaths.\r\n\r\nNot all potentially excess deaths can be prevented; some areas might have characteristics that predispose them to higher rates of death. However, many potentially excess deaths might represent deaths that could be prevented through improved public health programs that support healthier behaviors and neighborhoods or better access to health care services.\r\n\r\nMortality data for U.S. residents come from the National Vital Statistics System. Estimates based on fewer than 10 observed deaths are not shown and shaded yellow on the map.\r\n\r\nUnderlying cause of death is based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10)\r\n\r\nHeart disease (I00-I09, I11, I13, and I20\u2013I51)\r\nCancer (C00\u2013C97)\r\nUnintentional injury (V01\u2013X59 and Y85\u2013Y86)\r\nChronic lower respiratory disease (J40\u2013J47)\r\nStroke (I60\u2013I69)\r\nLocality (nonmetropolitan vs. metropolitan) is based on the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s 2013 county-based classification scheme.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks are based on the three states with the lowest age and cause-specific mortality rates.\r\n\r\nPotentially excess deaths for each state are calculated by subtracting deaths at the benchmark rates (expected deaths) from observed deaths.\r\n\r\nUsers can explore three benchmarks:\r\n\r\n\u201c2010 Fixed\u201d is a fixed benchmark based on the best performing States in 2010.\r\n\u201c2005 Fixed\u201d is a fixed benchmark based on the best performing States in 2005.\r\n\u201cFloating\u201d is based on the best performing States in each year so change from year to year.\r\n \r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nCDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, mortality data (see http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm); and CDC WONDER (see http://wonder.cdc.gov).\r\n\r\nREFERENCES \r\n\r\n1.

Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years between 2000 and 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published. Data on age-adjusted death rates prior to 1999 are taken from historical data (see References below).\n\nLife expectancy data are available up to 2017. Due to changes in categories of race used in publications, data are not available for the black population consistently before 1968, and not at all before 1960.

This is the largest nationwide COVID-19 seroprevalence survey to date. De-identified blood samples are tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to better understand the percentage of people in the United States who have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and to track how this percentage changes over time. Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccines currently used in the United States result in production of anti-spike (anti-S) antibodies but only infection results in production of anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) antibodies. Combined seroprevalence estimates the proportion of the population with evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 vaccination, or both. It estimates the proportion of the population with some presumed protection against infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. The term \u201ccombined seroprevalence\u201d refers to the combined infection- and vaccination-induced SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalences. This is the population that has  anti-S antibodies, regardless of the presence of anti-N antibodies.\n\nThis link connects to a webpage that displays the data from the Nationwide Blood Donor Seroprevalence Survey.

Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD\u201310 underlying cause-of-death codes X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined intent).\r\n\r\nEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132016 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\r\n\r\nDeath rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD\u201310 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, \u201cOther ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality\u201d (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Drug poisoning death rates may be underestimated in those instances.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n1. National Center for Health Statistics. National Vital Statistics System: Mortality data.

Excess deaths are typically defined as the difference between observed numbers of deaths and expected numbers. This visualization provides weekly data on excess deaths by jurisdiction of occurrence. Counts of deaths in more recent weeks are compared with historical trends to determine whether the number of deaths is significantly higher than expected.\n\nEstimates of excess deaths can be calculated in a variety of ways, and will vary depending on the methodology and assumptions about how many deaths are expected to occur. Estimates of excess deaths presented in this webpage were calculated using Farrington surveillance algorithms (1). For each jurisdiction, a model is used to generate a set of expected counts, and the upper bound of the 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) of these expected counts is used as a threshold to estimate excess deaths. Observed counts are compared to these upper bound estimates to determine whether a significant increase in deaths has occurred.

Although these data will continue to be publicly available, this dataset will no longer be updated.\n\n<b>Aggregate Data Collection Process\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, data were reported through a robust process with the following steps:</b><ul><li>Aggregate county-level counts were obtained indirectly, via automated overnight web collection, or directly, via a data submission process.</li><li>If more than one official county data source existed, CDC used a comprehensive data selection process comparing each official county data source to retrieve the highest case and death counts, unless otherwise specified by the state.</li><li>A CDC data team reviewed counts for congruency prior to integration. CDC routinely compiled these data and post the finalized information on COVID Data Tracker.</li><li>Cases and deaths are based on date of report and not on the date of symptom onset. CDC calculates rates in this data by using population estimates provided by the US Census Bureau Population Estimates Program (2019 Vintage).</li><li>COVID-19 aggregate case and death data were organized in a time series that includes cumulative number of cases and deaths as reported by a jurisdiction on a given date.  New case and death counts were calculated as the week-to-week change in reported cumulative cases and deaths (i.e., newly reported cases and deaths = cumulative number of cases/deaths reported this week minus the cumulative total reported the week before.</li></ul>\n\nThis process was collaborative, with CDC and jurisdictions working together to ensure the accuracy of COVID-19 case and death numbers. County counts provided the most up-to-date numbers on cases and deaths by report date. Throughout data collection, CDC retrospectively updated counts to correct known data quality issues. CDC also worked with jurisdictions after the end of the public health emergency declaration to finalize county data. \n<ul><li><b>Source:</b> The weekly archived dataset is based on county-level aggregate count data</li><li><b>Confirmed/Probable Cases/Death breakdown:</b> Cumulative cases and deaths for each county are included.  Total reported cases include probable and confirmed cases.</li><li><b>Time Series Frequency:</b> The weekly archived dataset contains weekly time series data (i.e., one record per week per county)</li></ul>\n \n<b>Important note:</b> The counts reflected during a given time period in this dataset may not match the counts reflected for the same time period in the daily archived dataset noted above. Discrepancies may exist due to differences between county and state COVID-19 case surveillance and reconciliation efforts.\n\nThe surveillance case definition for COVID-19, a nationally notifiable disease, was first described in a <a href=\"https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/\">position statement</a> from the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists, which was later <a href=\"https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/\">revised</a>. However, there is some variation in how jurisdictions implement these case classifications.

Instead, counts of confirmed and probable cases and deaths are included in the Total Cases and Total Deaths columns, when available. Not all jurisdictions reported probable cases and deaths to CDC.

Mumps to Novel influenza A virus infections - 2019. In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change.
