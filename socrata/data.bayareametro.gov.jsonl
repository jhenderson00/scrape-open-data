The unemployment rate reflects the strength of the overall employment market.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nCalifornia Employment Development Department: Historical Unemployment Rates\n1990-2018\nhttps://data.edd.ca.gov/Labor-Force-and-Unemployment-Rates/Local-Area-Unemployment-Statistics-LAUS-Annual-Ave/7jbb-3rb8\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nUnemployment rates produced by EDD for the region and county levels are not adjusted for seasonality (as they reflect annual data) and are final data (i.e., not preliminary). Unemployment rates produced by BLS for the metro regions are adjusted for seasonality; they reflect the primary MSA for the named region, except for the San Francisco Bay Area which uses the nine-county region. The unemployment rate is calculated based on the number of unemployed persons divided by the total labor force. Note that the unemployment rate can decline or increase as a result of changes in either variable.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-08-13T16:14:31.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-08-12T00:42:16.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-08-13T16:14:31.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-08-12T00:59:53.000Z", "columns_name": ["Year", "Metro", "Source", "Unemployment_Rate"], "columns_field_name": ["year", "metro", "source", "unemployment_rate"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "Share of the labor force that is not currently engaged in full-time or part-time work"], "columns_format": [{"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-08-12T00:59:54.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["economy", "demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/tabg-gyuh", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Unemployment-Rate-by-metro/tabg-gyuh", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

This is a derivative feature set, assembled by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC), created by merging county-specific, land-only inundation feature sets. The source, county-level feature sets were produced for Adapting to Rising Tides (ART), a program led by the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC), in September 2017.\n\nThe sea level rise (SLR) scenario used to produce this data represents 36 inches (three feet) of water level above the current mean higher high water (MHHW) tidal datum. This is considered the most likely level of sea level rise expected by 2100; or an existing 50-year extreme tide. The polygons contain the extent and depth of land-only inundation (in feet) flooding of the bayside shoreline. Depth of flooding were created by subtracting a land surface Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from the water surface DEM representing the SLR scenario (MHHW + SLR). Extent of flooding were created by employing a two rule assessment to determine if an area is inundated. It must be below the assigned water surface DEM elevation value, and it must be connected to an adjacent area that was either flooded or open water. This method applies an \"eight-side rule\" for connectedness, where the area is considered \"connected\" if any of its cardinal or diagonal directions is connected to a flooded area or open water. Hydraulic connectivity assessment removes areas from the inundation zone if they are protected by levees or other topographic features that prevent inland inundation. This assessment also removed areas that are low lying but inland and not directly connected to an adjacent inundated area.\n\nThe 36 inch SLR scenario can be used to approximate all extreme tide/sea level rise combinations that produce a water level in the range of MHHW + 33 inches to MHHW + 39 inches, including:\n\t- 36 inches of SLR;\n\t- 1-year extreme tide event coupled with 24 inches of SLR;\n\t- 2-year extreme tide event coupled with 18 inches of SLR;\n\t- 5-year extreme tide event coupled with 12 inches of SLR;\n\t- 25-year extreme tide event coupled with 6 inches of SLR, and\n\t- 50-year extreme tide event under existing conditions (no SLR).\n\n\nPublication Date: June 2019\n\nCreation Date: March 2019\n\nStatus:\nProgress: Complete\nMaintenance and Update Frequency: None planned\n\nContact Information:\nContact Organization: Metropolitan Transportation Commission\nContact Person: Data & Visualization\n\nContact Address:\nAddress Type: mailing and physical\nAddress: 375 Beale Street, Suite 800\nCity: San Francisco\nState or Province: California\nPostal Code: 94105\nCountry: United States of America\n\nContact Voice Telephone: (415) 778-6700\nContact Electronic Mail Address: dataviz@bayareametro.gov\nHours: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM (PST) Monday through Friday", "attribution": "San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission's Adapting to Rising Tides Program", "attribution_link": "https://www.adaptingtorisingtides.org", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2021-03-10T22:46:22.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-03-13T18:27:14.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2021-03-10T22:46:22.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-03-13T19:05:22.000Z", "columns_name": ["depth_ft", "objectid", "countyfp", "statefp", "the_geom"], "columns_field_name": ["depth_ft", "objectid", "countyfp", "statefp", "the_geom"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "MultiPolygon"], "columns_description": ["Depth of projected inundation, in 2 foot increments.

Industries are classified by their North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Vital Signs aggregates employment into 11 industry sectors: Farm, Mining, Logging and Construction, Manufacturing, Trade, Transportation and Utilities, Information, Financial Activities, Professional and Business Services, Educational and Health Services, Leisure and Hospitality, Government, and Other. EDD counts all public-sector jobs under Government, including public transportation, public schools, and public hospitals. The Other category includes service jobs such as auto repair and hair salons and organizations such as churches and social advocacy groups. Employment in the technology sector are classified under three categories: Professional and Business Services, Information, and Manufacturing. The latter category includes electronic and computer manufacturing. For further details of typical firms found in each sector, refer to the 2012 NAICS Manual (http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart=2012).\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides industry estimates for non-Bay Area metro areas. Their main industry employment estimates, the Current Employment Survey and Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, do not provide annual estimates of farm employment. To be consistent, the metro comparison evaluates nonfarm employment for all metro areas, including the Bay Area. Industry shares are thus slightly different for the Bay Area between the historical trend and metro comparison sections.\n\nThe location quotient (LQ) is used to evaluate level of concentration or clustering of an industry within the Bay Area and within each county of the region. A location quotient greater than 1 means there is a strong concentration for of jobs in an industry sector. For the Bay Area, the LQ is calculated as the share of the region\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the nation\u2019s employment in that same sector. Because BLS does not provide national farm estimates, note that there is no LQ for regional farm employment.

This is a derivative feature set, assembled by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC), created by merging county-specific, land-only inundation feature sets. The source, county-level feature sets were produced for Adapting to Rising Tides (ART), a program led by the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC), in September 2017.\n\nThe sea level rise (SLR) scenario used to produce this data represents 77 inches (a little less than six and one-half feet) of water level above the current mean higher high water (MHHW) tidal datum. This is also considered equivalent to 36 inches of SLR plus a 100-year extreme tide. The polygons contain the extent and depth of land-only inundation (in feet) flooding of the bayside shoreline. Depth of flooding were created by subtracting a land surface Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from the water surface DEM representing the SLR scenario (MHHW + SLR). Extent of flooding were created by employing a two rule assessment to determine if an area is inundated. It must be below the assigned water surface DEM elevation value, and it must be connected to an adjacent area that was either flooded or open water. This method applies an \"eight-side rule\" for connectedness, where the area is considered \"connected\" if any of its cardinal or diagonal directions is connected to a flooded area or open water. Hydraulic connectivity assessment removes areas from the inundation zone if they are protected by levees or other topographic features that prevent inland inundation. This assessment also removed areas that are low lying but inland and not directly connected to an adjacent inundated area.\n\nThe 77 inch SLR scenario can be used to approximate all extreme tide/sea level rise combinations that produce a water level in the range of MHHW + 74 inches to MHHW + 80 inches, including:\n\t- 77 inches of SLR;\n\t- 1-year extreme tide event coupled with 66 inches of SLR;\n\t- 2-year extreme tide event coupled with 60 inches of SLR;\n\t- 5-year extreme tide event coupled with 54 inches of SLR;\n\t- 10-year extreme tide event coupled with 52 inches of SLR;\n\t- 25-year extreme tide event coupled with 48 inches of SLR;\n\t- 50-year extreme tide event coupled with 42 inches of SLR, and\n\t- 100-year extreme tide event coupled with 36 inches of SLR.\n\n**In 2019, The San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission released additional data to add East Contra Costa and Solano areas to the existing, 2017 data that focused on San Francisco Bay. This update did not include all the sea level scenarios produced in 2017. The 77-inch scenario was one of the ones for which data for East Contra Costa and Solano was not produced.**\n\n\nSource Data Produced: September 2017\n\nMTC Publication Date: June 2019\n\nStatus:\nProgress: Complete\nMaintenance and Update Frequency: None planned\n\nContact Information:\nContact Organization: Metropolitan Transportation Commission\nContact Person: Data & Visualization\n\nContact Address:\nAddress Type: mailing and physical\nAddress: 375 Beale Street, Suite 800\nCity: San Francisco\nState or Province: California\nPostal Code: 94105\nCountry: United States of America\n\nContact Voice Telephone: (415) 778-6700\nContact Electronic Mail Address: dataviz@bayareametro.gov\nHours: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM (PST) Monday through Friday", "attribution": "San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission's Adapting to Rising Tides Program", "attribution_link": "https://www.adaptingtorisingtides.org", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2021-03-15T18:07:55.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-03-13T18:54:13.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2021-03-15T18:07:55.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-03-13T19:33:23.000Z", "columns_name": ["depth_ft", "objectid", "statefp", "countyfp", "the_geom"], "columns_field_name": ["depth_ft", "objectid", "statefp", "countyfp", "the_geom"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "MultiPolygon"], "columns_description": ["Depth of projected inundation, in 2 foot increments.

The definition involves a racial/ethnic concentration threshold and a poverty test. The racial/ethnic concentration threshold is straightforward: R/ECAPs must have a non-white population of 50 percent or more. Regarding the poverty threshold, Wilson (1980) defines neighborhoods of extreme poverty as census tracts with 40 percent or more of individuals living at or below the poverty line. Because overall poverty levels are substantially lower in many parts of the country, HUD supplements this with an alternate criterion. Thus, a neighborhood can be a R/ECAP if it has a poverty rate that exceeds 40% or is three or more times the average tract poverty rate for the metropolitan/micropolitan area, whichever threshold is lower. Census tracts with this extreme poverty that satisfy the racial/ethnic concentration threshold are deemed R/ECAPs. \n\nData Source: Decennial census (2010); American Community Survey (ACS), 2006-2010; Brown Longitudinal Tract Database (LTDB) based on decennial census data, 2000 & 1990 References: Wilson, William J.

Authorized by the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, the National Park Service's National Register of Historic Places is part of a national program to coordinate and support public and private efforts to identify, evaluate, and protect America's historic and archeological resources.\n\nThe National Park Service Cultural Resources GIS program has created spatial data from the unrestricted National Register of Historic Places database (NRIS) inventory in a file geodatabase format using ESRI\u2019s ArcMap 10.0. The data model is structured in compliance with NPS Cultural Resources Spatial Data Transfer Standards. More detail on the model and these standards can be found here: https://www.nps.gov/crgis/crgis_standards_overview.htm\n\nUse of this information in meeting a federal agency\u2019s responsibilities under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act does not in itself constitute compliance with Section 106, which requires agencies to consult with the appropriate State and/or Tribal Preservation Offices in the identification and evaluation of historic properties.\n\nUsers should be aware that many points and polygon boundaries require some level of correction. In general, this dataset contains modest corrections to the coordinates contained in the NRIS with reference to some of the point data. In many cases, polygon boundaries may appear incorrect due to minor errors in the database. It is our intent to be able to address these errors and improve the quality of the spatial data over time.\n\nSource: https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nationalregister/data-downloads.htm (National Park Service)", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2021-09-10T03:08:15.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-09-10T03:08:10.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2021-09-10T03:08:11.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2021-09-10T03:08:15.000Z", "columns_name": ["Source Date", "Is Extant Comment", "CSO_info", "Resource Name", "the_geom", "DIST", "Type", "NPS Unit Name", "Originating Institution", "Source", "Boundary Type", "OBJECTID"], "columns_field_name": ["src_date", "extant_oth", "cso_info", "resname", "the_geom", "dist", "type", "unit", "originator", "source", "bnd_type", "objectid"], "columns_datatype": ["Date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Point", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2021-09-10T03:08:11.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/u5vb-9gsu", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/National_Register_Locations/u5vb-9gsu", "owner": {"id": "gmr7-ynpt", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kearey Smith"}, "creator": {"id": "gmr7-ynpt", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kearey Smith"}}

Congestion is defined as speeds less than 35 mph, the level at which freeway throughput is maximized. The dataset includes regional and county tables for congested share of freeway miles driven.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nMTC/Caltrans: Performance Monitoring System (PeMS) Congested Mileage Analysis\n2004-2016\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nCongested VMT data only includes freeway facilities and relies upon PeMS traffic data. They reflect delay on a typical weekday, which is defined as Tuesday through Thursday during peak traffic months. Delay statistics emphasize recurring delay - i.e. consistent delay greater than 15 minutes on a specific freeway segment. Congested delay is defined as congestion occurring with speeds less than 35 mph and is commonly recognized as inefficient delay (meaning that the freeway corridor is operating at speeds low enough to reduce throughput - as opposed to speeds greater than 35 mph which increase throughput).", "attribution": "MTC", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2018-07-10T01:39:01.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-05-11T20:53:45.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-07-10T01:39:01.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-05-11T20:53:50.000Z", "columns_name": ["Congest_Share", "Source", "County", "Year"], "columns_field_name": ["congest_share", "source", "county", "year"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Share of freeway miles traveled in congestion [to convert to %, multiply by 100]", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "3", "align": "right"}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-05-11T21:05:43.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/ucfz-jvxi", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Miles-Traveled-in-Congestion-by-county/ucfz-jvxi", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

The dataset includes metropolitan area, county, city, and census tract tables by place of residence.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census (1980-2000) - via MTC/ABAG Bay Area Census\nhttp://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/transportation.htm\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey\nForm B08013 (2006-2018; place of residence; overall time)\nForm C08136 (2006-2018; place of residence; time by mode)\nForm B08301 (2006-2018; place of residence)\nwww.api.census.gov\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nFor the decennial Census datasets, breakdown of commute times was unavailable by mode; only overall data could be provided on a historical basis.\n\nFor the American Community Survey datasets, 1-year rolling average data was used for all metros, region, and county geographic levels, while 5-year rolling average data was used for cities and tracts. This is due to the fact that more localized data is not included in the 1-year dataset across all Bay Area cities. Similarly, modal data is not available for every Bay Area city or census tract, even when the 5-year data is used for those localized geographies.\n\nRegional commute times were calculated by summing aggregate county travel times and dividing by the relevant population; similarly, modal commute time were calculated using aggregate times and dividing by the number of communities choosing that mode for the given geography. Census tract data is not available for tracts with insufficient numbers of residents.\n\nThe metropolitan area comparison was performed for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area in addition to the primary MSAs for the nine other major metropolitan areas.", "attribution": "U.S. Census Bureau", "attribution_link": "https://data.census.gov", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2020-05-20T21:50:23.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-04-13T21:18:35.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-05-20T21:50:23.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2020-04-23T17:30:26.000Z", "columns_name": ["Source1", "GT_90_min_Commute_Time", "45_59_min_Commute_Time", "Source2", "60_89_min_Commute_Time", "GT_60_min_Commute_Time", "30_45_min_Commute_Time", "LT_15_min_Commute_Time", "Avg_Commute_Time", "Mode", "Data_Type", "Source3", "Year", "15_29_min_Commute_Time", "County"], "columns_field_name": ["source1", "gt_90_min_commute_time", "_45_59_min_commute_time", "source2", "_60_89_min_commute_time", "gt_60_min_commute_time", "_30_45_min_commute_time", "lt_15_min_commute_time", "avg_commute_time", "mode", "data_type", "source3", "year", "_15_29_min_commute_time", "county"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-04-13T21:19:38.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/ud2z-3ee9", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Commute-Time-by-Place-of-Residence-by-/ud2z-3ee9", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, county, city and census tract tables by place of residence.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census (1960-2000) - via MTC/ABAG Bay Area Census  \nhttp://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/transportation/Means19602000.htm  \nhttp://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/transportation/Means19802000.htm\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey  \n2006-2021  \nForm B08301  \nForm B08301  \nwww.api.census.gov\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nFor the decennial Census datasets, the breakdown of auto commuters between drive alone and carpool is not available before 1980. \"Other\" includes bicycle, motorcycle, taxi, and other modes of transportation. American Community Survey 1-year data is used for larger geographies \u2013 Bay counties and most metropolitan area counties \u2013 while smaller geographies rely upon 5-year rolling average data due to their smaller sample sizes. Note that 2020 data uses the 5-year estimates since 1-year data was not collected for 2020 (see https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-1year.2020.html). Additionally, for the County [by place of residence] breakdown, Napa was missing ACS 1-Year commute mode choice data for all modes for 2007, 2008, 2011, and 2021. 5-Year estimates were used to fill the missing data for 2011 and 2021, but not 2007 or 2008 since the 5-Year estimates start in 2009.\n\nRegional mode shares are population-weighted averages of the nine counties' modal shares. \"Auto\" includes drive alone and carpool for the simple data tables and is broken out in the detailed data tables accordingly, as it was not available before 1980. \"Transit\" includes public operators (Muni, BART, etc.) and employer-provided shuttles (e.g., Google shuttle buses). \"Other\" includes motorcycle, taxi, and other modes of transportation; bicycle mode share was broken out separately for the first time in the 2006 data and is shown in the detailed data tables. Census tract data is not available for tracts with insufficient numbers of residents or workers.\n\nThe metropolitan area comparison was performed for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area in addition to the primary MSAs for other major metropolitan areas.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-02-15T20:51:45.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-07-08T00:17:06.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-02-15T20:51:45.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-01-31T23:57:33.000Z", "columns_name": ["Source", "Share", "County", "Mode", "Data_Type", "Year"], "columns_field_name": ["source", "share", "county", "mode", "data_type", "year"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-07-08T00:17:08.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/uhk5-xynh", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Commute-Mode-Choice-by-Place-of-Reside/uhk5-xynh", "owner": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}, "creator": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}}

This measure reflects the changing industry trends that affect our region\u2019s workers.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nBureau of Labor Statistics, Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW)  \n1990-2021  \nhttps://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nQCEW employment data is reported by the place of work and represent the number of covered workers who worked during, or received pay for, the pay period that included the 12th day of the month. Covered employees in the private-sector and in the state and local government include most corporate officials, all executives, all supervisory personnel, all professionals, all clerical workers, many farmworkers, all wage earners, all piece workers, and all part-time workers. Workers on paid sick leave, paid holiday, paid vacation, and the like are also covered.\n\nBesides excluding the aforementioned national security agencies, QCEW excludes proprietors, the unincorporated self-employed, unpaid family members, certain farm and domestic workers from having to report employment data, and railroad workers covered by the railroad unemployment insurance system. Excluded as well are workers who earned no wages during the entire applicable pay period because of work stoppages, temporary layoffs, illness, or unpaid vacations. \n\nThe location quotient (LQ) is used to evaluate level of concentration or clustering of an industry within the Bay Area and within each county of the region. A location quotient greater than 1 means there is a strong concentration for of jobs in an industry sector. For the Bay Area, the LQ is calculated as the share of the region\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of California's employment in that same sector. For each county, the LQ is calculated as the share of the county\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the region\u2019s employment in that same sector.\n\nData is mainly pulled from aggregation level 73, which is county-level summarized at the NAICS supersector level (12 sectors). This aggregation level exhibits the least loss due to data suppression, in the magnitude of 1-2 percent for regional employment, and is therefore preferred. However, the supersectors group together NAICS 11 Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, and Hunting; NAICS 21 Mining, and NAICS 23 Construction. To provide a separate tally of Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, and Hunting, the aggregation level 74 data was used for NAICS codes 11, 21 and 23. \n\nQCEW reports on employment in Public Administration as NAICS 92. However, many government activities are reported with an industry specific code - such as transportation or utilities even if those may be public governmental entities. In 2021 for the Bay Area, the largest industry groupings under public ownership are Education and health services (58%); Public administration (29%), and Trade, transportation, and utilities (29%). With the exception of Education and health services, all other public activities were coded as government/public administration, regardless of industry group.\n\nFor the county data there were some industries that reported 0 jobs or did not report jobs at the desired aggregation/NAICS level for the following counties/years:\n\nFarm:  \n(aggregation level: 74, NAICS code: 11)\n- Contra Costa: 2008-2010\n- Marin: 1990-2006, 2008-2010, 2014-2020\n- Napa: 1990-2004, 2013-2021\n- San Francisco: 2019-2020\n- San Mateo: 2013\n\nInformation:  \n(aggregation level: 73, NAICS code: 51)\n- Solano: 2001\n\nFinancial Activities:  \n(aggregation level: 73, NAICS codes: 52, 53)\n- Solano: 2001\n\nUnclassified:  \n(aggregation level: 73, NAIC", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-02-16T05:05:14.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-06-10T00:59:12.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-02-16T05:05:14.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-12-14T23:52:49.000Z", "columns_name": ["industry_name", "Percntchng_1990", "Year", "Jobs", "Lq", "Industry", "Objectid", "Source", "County", "Quadrant"], "columns_field_name": ["industry_name", "percntchng_1990", "year", "jobs", "lq", "industry", "objectid", "source", "county", "quadrant"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "percntchng_1990", "Year", "Total Jobs", "Location Quotient", "Industry", "objectid", "Source", "county", "quadrant"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-07-06T20:26:30.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Economy", "domain_tags": ["ec1", "vital signs", "vital signs 2.0"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/uijm-ykyx", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/Economy/Vital-Signs-Jobs-by-Industry-Location-Quotient-by-/uijm-ykyx", "owner": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}, "creator": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}}
{"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Transit Ridership by Operator - Bay Area (2022) DRAFT", "id": "uk8v-3g2v", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Vital Signs: Transit Ridership by Operator - Bay Area (2022) DRAFT\nVITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nTransit Ridership (T11)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nDaily transit boardings\n\nLAST UPDATED\nJune 2022\n\nDESCRIPTION\nTransit ridership refers to the number of passenger boardings on public transportation, which includes buses, rail systems and ferries. The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, mode and operator tables for total typical weekday boardings.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nFederal Transit Administration: National Transit Database\nhttp://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nThe NTD dataset was lightly cleaned to correct for erroneous zero values - in which null values (unsubmitted data) were incorrectly marked as zeroes. Paratransit data is sparse in early years of the NTD dataset, meaning that transit ridership estimates in the early 1990s are likely underestimated. Simple modes were aggregated to combine the various bus modes (e.g. rapid bus, express bus, local bus) into a single mode to avoid incorrect conclusions resulting from mode recoding over the lifespan of NTD.\n\n2021 data should be considered preliminary, as it comes from the monthly data tables rather than the longer-term time-series dataset. Weekday ridership is calculated by taking the total annual ridership and dividing by 300, an assumption which is consistent with MTC travel modeling procedures; it was also compared to observed weekday boarding data (which is more limited in availability) to ensure consistency on the regional level. Per-capita transit ridership is calculated for the operator's general service area or taxation district; for example, BART includes the three core counties (San Francisco, Alameda, and Contra Costa) as well as northern San Mateo County post-SFO extension and AC Transit includes the cities located within its service area. For other metro areas, operators were identified by developing a list of all urbanized areas within a current MSA boundary and then using that UZA list to flag relevant operators; this means that all operators (both large and small) were included in the metro comparison data.\n\n\nData Provided by Federal Transit Administration: National Transit Database", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-02-10T22:59:00.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-06-29T19:52:06.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-08-18T18:38:53.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-10T22:59:00.000Z", "columns_name": ["Percentchg_1991", "Annual_Boardings", "Year", "System", "Objectid", "Est_Weekday_Boardings", "System_Full_Name", "Source", "Agency_Size"], "columns_field_name": ["percentchg_1991", "annual_boardings", "year", "system", "objectid", "est_weekday_boardings", "system_full_name", "source", "agency_size"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Ridership Change Since 1991", "Annual Boardings", "Year", "Transit Operator", "objectid", "Estimated Weekday Boardings", "Transit System Name", "Source", "Groups operators into large and small operators"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-08-18T18:38:53.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Transportation", "domain_tags": ["t11t12", "vital signs", "vital signs 2.0"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/uk8v-3g2v", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/Transportation/Vital-Signs-Transit-Ridership-by-Operator-Bay-Area/uk8v-3g2v", "owner": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}, "creator": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}}

{"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Jobs by Industry by County (2022)", "id": "uq26-k9zb", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR  \nJobs by Industry (EC1)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME  \nEmployment by place of work by industry sector\n\nLAST UPDATED  \nDecember 2022\n\nDESCRIPTION  \nJobs by industry refers to both the change in employment levels by industry and the proportional mix of jobs by economic sector. This measure reflects the changing industry trends that affect our region\u2019s workers.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nBureau of Labor Statistics, Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW)  \n1990-2021  \nhttps://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nQCEW employment data is reported by the place of work and represent the number of covered workers who worked during, or received pay for, the pay period that included the 12th day of the month. Covered employees in the private-sector and in the state and local government include most corporate officials, all executives, all supervisory personnel, all professionals, all clerical workers, many farmworkers, all wage earners, all piece workers, and all part-time workers. Workers on paid sick leave, paid holiday, paid vacation, and the like are also covered.\n\nBesides excluding the aforementioned national security agencies, QCEW excludes proprietors, the unincorporated self-employed, unpaid family members, certain farm and domestic workers from having to report employment data, and railroad workers covered by the railroad unemployment insurance system. Excluded as well are workers who earned no wages during the entire applicable pay period because of work stoppages, temporary layoffs, illness, or unpaid vacations. \n\nThe location quotient (LQ) is used to evaluate level of concentration or clustering of an industry within the Bay Area and within each county of the region. A location quotient greater than 1 means there is a strong concentration for of jobs in an industry sector. For the Bay Area, the LQ is calculated as the share of the region\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of California's employment in that same sector. For each county, the LQ is calculated as the share of the county\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the region\u2019s employment in that same sector.\n\nData is mainly pulled from aggregation level 73, which is county-level summarized at the NAICS supersector level (12 sectors). This aggregation level exhibits the least loss due to data suppression, in the magnitude of 1-2 percent for regional employment, and is therefore preferred. However, the supersectors group together NAICS 11 Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, and Hunting; NAICS 21 Mining, and NAICS 23 Construction. To provide a separate tally of Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, and Hunting, the aggregation level 74 data was used for NAICS codes 11, 21 and 23. \n\nQCEW reports on employment in Public Administration as NAICS 92. However, many government activities are reported with an industry specific code - such as transportation or utilities even if those may be public governmental entities. In 2021 for the Bay Area, the largest industry groupings under public ownership are Education and health services (58%); Public administration (29%), and Trade, transportation, and utilities (29%). With the exception of Education and health services, all other public activities were coded as government/public administration, regardless of industry group.\n\nFor the county data there were some industries that reported 0 jobs or did not report jobs at the desired aggregation/NAICS level for the following counties/years:\n\nFarm:  \n(aggregation level: 74, NAICS code: 11)\n- Contra Costa: 2008-2010\n- Marin: 1990-2006, 2008-2010, 2014-2020\n- Napa: 1990-2004, 2013-2021\n- San Francisco: 2019-2020\n- San Mateo: 2013\n\nInformation:  \n(aggregation level: 73, NAICS code: 51)\n- Solano: 2001\n\nFinancial Activities:  \n(aggregation level: 73, NAICS codes: 52, 53)\n- Solano: 2001\n\nUnclassified:  \n(aggregation level: 73, NAIC", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-02-16T05:05:12.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-06-10T00:59:08.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-02-16T05:05:12.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-12-14T21:21:08.000Z", "columns_name": ["Uncl", "Other", "Govt", "Ehs", "Pbs", "Fa", "Ttu", "Manuf", "Mlc", "Farm", "Total", "Year", "Geoname", "Objectid", "Source", "Lh", "Inform"], "columns_field_name": ["uncl", "other", "govt", "ehs", "pbs", "fa", "ttu", "manuf", "mlc", "farm", "total", "year", "geo_name", "objectid", "source", "lh", "inform"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Unclassified Employment", "Other Service Employment", "Government Employment", "Education and health services Employment", "Professional and business services Employment", "Financial activities Employment", "Trade, transportation, and utilities Employment", "Manufacturing Employment", "Natural resources, mining and construction Employment", "farm", "Total Employment", "Year", "Geography", "objectid", "Source", "Leisure and hospitality Employment", "Information Employment"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-12-14T21:18:40.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Economy", "domain_tags": ["ec1", "vital signs", "vital signs 2.0"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/uq26-k9zb", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/Economy/Vital-Signs-Jobs-by-Industry-by-County-2022-/uq26-k9zb", "owner": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}, "creator": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}}

Income data highlight how employees are being compensated for their work on an inflation-adjusted basis.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census  \nCount 4Pb (1970)  \nForm STF3 (1980-1990)  \nForm SF3a (2000)  \nhttps://nhgis.org\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey  \nForm B19001 (2005-2021; household income by place of residence)  \nForm B19013 (2005-2021; median household income by place of residence)  \nForm B08521 (2005-2021; median worker earnings by place of employment)  \nhttps://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics: Consumer Price Index  \n1970-2021  \nhttps://www.bls.gov/data/\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nIncome data reported in a given year reflects the income earned in the prior year (decennial Census) or in the prior 12 months (American Community Survey); note that this inconsistency has a minor effect on historical comparisons. American Community Survey 1-year data is used for larger geographies \u2013 Bay counties and most metropolitan area counties \u2013 while smaller geographies rely upon 5-year rolling average data due to their smaller sample sizes. Note that 2020 data uses the 5-year estimates since 1-year data was not collected for 2020.\n\nQuintile income for 1970-2000 is imputed from Decennial Census data using methodology from the California Department of Finance. Bay Area income is the population weighted average of county-level income.\n\nIncome has been inflated using the Consumer Price Index for 2021 specific to each metro area; however, some metro areas lack metro-specific CPI data back to 1970 and therefore adjusted data uses national CPI for 1970. Note that current MSA boundaries were used for historical comparison by identifying counties included in today\u2019s metro areas.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-02-23T01:59:50.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-06-08T00:04:44.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-02-23T01:59:50.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-01T00:30:37.000Z", "columns_name": ["60_Percentile_HH_Inc_PlaceOfResidence_IA", "40_Percentile_HH_Inc_PlaceOfResidence_IA", "Source", "80_Percentile_HH_Inc_PlaceOfResidence_IA_PerChg1970", "60_Percentile_HH_Inc_PlaceOfResidence_IA_PerChg1970", "20_Percentile_HH_Inc_PlaceOfResidence_IA_PerChg1970", "20_Percentile_HH_Inc_PlaceOfResidence_IA", "Residence_Geo", "40_Percentile_HH_Inc_PlaceOfResidence_IA_PerChg1970", "80_Percentile_HH_Inc_PlaceOfResidence_IA", "Year"], "columns_field_name": ["_60_percentile_hh_inc_placeofresidence_ia", "_40_percentile_hh_inc_placeofresidence_ia", "source", "_80_percentile_hh_inc_placeofresidence_ia_perchg1970", "_60_percentile_hh_inc_placeofresidence_ia_perchg1970", "_20_percentile_hh_inc_placeofresidence_ia_perchg1970", "_20_percentile_hh_inc_placeofresidence_ia", "residence_geo", "_40_percentile_hh_inc_placeofresidence_ia_perchg1970", "_80_percentile_hh_inc_placeofresidence_ia", "year"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-06-08T00:04:46.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/uqny-9tcf", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Income-Quintile-by-Place-of-Residence-/uqny-9tcf", "owner": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}, "creator": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}}

While \u201cat risk\u201d households may not necessarily be displaced in the short-term or long-term, neighborhoods identified as being \u201cat risk\u201d signify pressure as reflected by the decline in lower-income households (who are presumed to relocate to other more affordable communities).

Historical data is pulled from U.S. Census datasets and aligned with today\u2019s census tract boundaries using crosswalk tables provided by LTDB. Tract data, as well as regional income data, are calculated using 5-year rolling averages for consistency \u2013 given that tract data is only available on a 5-year basis. Using household tables by income level, the number of households in each tract falling below the median are summed, which involves summing all brackets below the regional median and then summing a fractional share of the bracket that includes the regional median (assuming a simple linear distribution within that bracket).\n\nOnce all tracts in a given county or metro area are synced to today\u2019s boundaries, the analysis identifies census tracts of greater than 500 lower-income people (in the prior year) to filter out low-population areas. For those tracts, any net loss between the prior year and the analysis year results in that tract being flagged as being at risk of displacement, and all lower-income households in that tract are flagged. To calculate the share of households at risk, the number of lower-income households living in flagged tracts are summed and divided by the total number of lower-income households living in the larger geography (county or metro). Minor deviations on a year-to-year basis should be taken in context, given that data on the tract level often fluctuates and has a significant margin of error; changes on the county and regional level are more appropriate to consider on an annual basis instead.", "attribution": "U.S. Census Bureau", "attribution_link": "http://api.census.gov", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-08-13T16:06:00.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-12-12T22:26:37.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-08-13T16:06:00.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2018-12-12T22:31:04.000Z", "columns_name": ["Displacement_Risk", "Region", "Source3", "Source1", "Source2", "Year", "LIHH_At_Risk", "LIHH_Total"], "columns_field_name": ["displacement_risk", "region", "source3", "source1", "source2", "year", "lihh_at_risk", "lihh_total"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Share of lower income households at risk", "", "", "", "", "", "Number of lower-income households at risk", "Total number of lower-income households"], "columns_format": [{"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-12-12T22:31:05.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "infrastructure", "environment"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/uyub-9ixw", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Displacement-Risk-Bay-Area/uyub-9ixw", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

Vital Signs tracks greenhouse gas emissions linked to consumption from the three largest sources in the region: surface transportation, electricity consumption, and natural gas consumption. This measure helps track progress towards achieving regional greenhouse gas reduction targets, including the region's per-capita greenhouse gas target for surface transportation under Senate Bill 375. This dataset includes emissions estimates on the regional and county levels.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nUS Energy Information Administration: Carbon Dioxide Emissions Coefficients  \n1990-2021  \nhttps://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/co2_vol_mass.php\n\nCalifornia Energy Commission: Retail Fuel Outlet Annual Reporting (Form CEC-A15)  \n2010-2021  \nhttps://www.energy.ca.gov/data-reports/energy-almanac/transportation-energy/california-retail-fuel-outlet-annual-reporting\n\nCalifornia Energy Commission: Electricity Consumption by County  \n1990-2021  \nhttp://www.ecdms.energy.ca.gov/elecbycounty.aspx\n\nCalifornia Energy Commission: Natural Gas Consumption by County  \n1990-2021  \nhttp://www.ecdms.energy.ca.gov/gasbycounty.aspx\n\nCalifornia Department of Finance: Population and Housing Estimates, E-4  \n1990-2021  \nhttp://www.dof.ca.gov/research/demographic/\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nEmissions in this dataset are reported in metric tons.\n\nFor surface transportation, the dataset is based on a survey of fueling stations, the vast majority of which respond to the survey; the Energy Commission corrects for non-response bias by imputing the remaining share of fuel sales. Note that 2014 data was excluded to data abnormalities for several counties in the region; methodology improvements in 2012 affected estimated by +/- 5% according to CEC estimates. For years 2013 and 2014, a linear trendline assumption was used instead between 2012 and 2015 data points. Greenhouse gas emissions are calculated based on the gallons of gasoline and diesel sales, relying upon standardized Energy Information Administration conversion rates for E10 fuel (gasoline with 10% ethanol) and standard diesel. Per-capita greenhouse gas emissions are calculated simply by dividing emissions attributable to fuel sold in that county by the total number of county residents; there may be a slight bias in the data given that a fraction of fuel sold in a given county may be purchased by non-residents.\n\nFor electricity consumption, the dataset is based on electricity consumption data for the nine Bay Area counties; note that this is different than electricity production as the region imports electricity from elsewhere. Because of the uncertainty related to the specific origin of electricity consumed in the region, coupled with a regulatory change, PGE reported emissions differently beginning in with the 2019 year. Per PGE, \"For 2019 emissions reporting, PG&E used the CEC\u2019s Power Source Disclosure program methodology to calculate the CO2 emission rate associated with the electricity delivered to retail customers. As required by AB 1110, the CEC modified the Power Source Disclosure program methodology in 2020 for the 2019 reporting year. This methodology differed from prior reporting years and results in a significantly lower emissions rate.\" Instead of using a conversion factor beginning in 2019 that was 76 times lower than the one reported for 2018, ABAG/MTC staff for this update decided to rely on statewide GHG conversion factors obtained from the Energy Information Administration, for which there is a complete time series, allowing for more consistent emissions estimates. This choice will tend to over-estimate emissions in more recent years, as", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-02-15T01:05:27.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-06-13T22:14:49.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-02-15T00:08:08.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-15T01:05:27.000Z", "columns_name": ["Pc_Ghg_Electricity_Metrictons", "Pc_Ghg_Electricity_Nonresidential_Metrictons", "Pc_Ghg_Naturalgas_Metrictons", "Pc_Ghg_Naturalgas_Nonresidential_Metrictons", "Population", "Ghg_Total_Metrictons", "Ghg_Electricity_Residential_Metrictons", "Ghg_Naturalgas_Nonresidential_Metrictons", "Region", "Pc_Ghg_Naturalgas_Residential_Metrictons", "Pc_Ghg_Transport_Diesel_Metrictons", "Ghg_Electricity_Nonresidential_Metrictons", "Ghg_Naturalgas_Metrictons", "Year", "Objectid", "Pc_Ghg_Transport_Metrictons", "Source2", "Ghg_Naturalgas_Residential_Metrictons", "Pc_Ghg_Total_Metrictons", "Pc_Ghg_Electricity_Residential_Metrictons", "Ghg_Transport_Metrictons", "Ghg_Transport_Diesel_Metrictons", "Ghg_Transport_Gasoline_Metrictons", "Source3", "Pc_Ghg_Transport_Gasoline_Metrictons", "Ghg_Electricity_Metrictons", "Source1"], "columns_field_name": ["pc_ghg_electricity_metrictons", "pc_ghg_electricity_nonresidential_metrictons", "pc_ghg_naturalgas_metrictons", "pc_ghg_naturalgas_nonresidential_metrictons", "population", "ghg_total_metrictons", "ghg_electricity_residential_metrictons", "ghg_naturalgas_nonresidential_metrictons", "region", "pc_ghg_naturalgas_residential_metrictons", "pc_ghg_transport_diesel_metrictons", "ghg_electricity_nonresidential_metrictons", "ghg_naturalgas_metrictons", "year", "objectid", "pc_ghg_transport_metrictons", "source2", "ghg_naturalgas_residential_metrictons", "pc_ghg_total_metrictons", "pc_ghg_electricity_residential_metrictons", "ghg_transport_metrictons", "ghg_transport_diesel_metrictons", "ghg_transport_gasoline_metrictons", "source3", "pc_ghg_transport_gasoline_metrictons", "ghg_electricity_metrictons", "source1"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Per Capita GHG Electricity", "Per Capita GHG Electricity Nonresidential", "Per Capita GHG Naturalgas", "Per Capita GHG Naturalgas Nonresidential", "Population", "GHG Total", "GHG Electricity Residential", "GHG Naturalgas Nonresidential", "Region", "Per Capita GHG Naturalgas Residential", "Per Capita GHG Transport Diesel", "GHG Electricity Nonresidential", "GHG Naturalgas", "Year", "objectid", "Per Capita GHG Transport", "Source2", "GHG Naturalgas Residential", "Per Capita GHG Total", "Per Capita GHG Electricity Residential", "GHG Transport", "GHG Transport Diesel", "GHG Transport Gasoline", "Source3", "Per Capita GHG Transport Gasoline", "GHG Electricity", "Source1"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-06-13T22:14:53.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Environment", "domain_tags": ["en3", "vital signs", "vital signs 2.0"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/v36b-9net", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/Environment/Vital-Signs-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-Bay-Area-2022/v36b-9net", "owner": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}, "creator": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}}

To allow for historical comparisons, the Census Bureau merges housing expenditure brackets into three consistent bins (less than 20 percent, 20 percent to 34 percent, and more than 35 percent) that work for all years. The highest income bracket for renters in the ACS data was \\$100,000 or more, while the homeowner dataset included brackets for \\$100,000 to \\$149,999 and \\$150,000 and above. These brackets were merged together to allow for uniform comparison across tenure. While some studies use 30 percent as the affordability threshold, Vital Signs uses 35 percent as this is the closest break point using the standardized affordability brackets above.\n\nAmerican Community Survey 1-year data is used for larger geographies \u2013 Bay counties and most metropolitan area counties \u2013 while smaller geographies rely upon 5-year rolling average data due to their smaller sample sizes. Note that 2020 data uses the 5-year estimates since 1-year data was not collected for 2020 (see https:www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-1year.2020.html).\n\nIncome breakdown data is only provided for one year as it is not possible to compare consistent inflation-adjusted income brackets over time given Census data limitations. For the county breakdown, Napa was missing ACS 1-Year renter data for all years except 2012 and 2013, and Marin was missing ACS 1-Year renter data for 2019 \u2014 these counties used 5-Year data for those years.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-02-15T07:48:14.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-06-20T22:12:23.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-02-15T07:48:14.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-01-03T19:48:46.000Z", "columns_name": ["Share", "Housing_Burden", "Income Bracket", "Geography", "Renter_Source", "Owner_Source", "Year"], "columns_field_name": ["share", "housing_burden", "income_bracket", "geography", "renter_source", "owner_source", "year"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-12-29T21:29:03.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/va7e-4jn9", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Housing-Affordability-County-by-Income/va7e-4jn9", "owner": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}, "creator": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}}

Fine particulate matter particles are very small, measuring less than 2.5 microns (\u03bcg) or 1/25 the width of a human hair \u2013 yet they pose a significant health risk. Air quality standards for particulate matter are expressed in two ways: the annual average (reflecting average concentrations during the course of a given year) and the 24-hour average (reflecting worst-case conditions in a given year).

Data either reflect the annual average or the 98th percentile day (worst-case conditions); some data are reported as three-year rolling averages to minimize noise associated with any given year. The worst location site may shift from year to year depending on which sensor location had the highest levels of fine particulate matter over that particular time period. The regional trend reflects the average of eight sensors that were available throughout the analysis time period, using an iterated 2-way ANOVA for interpolation in gap years.", "attribution": "Bay Area Air Quality Management District", "attribution_link": "http://www.baaqmd.gov/about-air-quality/air-quality-summaries", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2018-07-06T18:04:31.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-06-23T18:29:33.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-07-06T18:04:31.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-06-23T18:30:34.000Z", "columns_name": ["Source", "PM2.5_AnnualAvg_ugm3_3YR", "PM2.5_daily98percentile_ugm3_1YR", "PM2.5_daily98percentile_ugm3_3YR", "Sensor", "Year", "PM2.5_AnnualAvg_ugm3_1YR"], "columns_field_name": ["source", "pm2_5_annualavg_ugm3_3yr", "pm2_5_daily98percentile_ugm3_1yr", "pm2_5_daily98percentile_ugm3_3yr", "sensor", "year", "pm2_5_annualavg_ugm3_1yr"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "Fine particulate concentrations - annual average; 3-year rolling average (in micrograms per cubic meter)\n", "Fine particulate concentrations - 98th percentile day; 1-year (in micrograms per cubic meter)\n", "Fine particulate concentrations - 98th percentile day; 3-year rolling average (in micrograms per cubic meter)\n", "", "", "Fine particulate concentrations - annual average; 1-year (in micrograms per cubic meter)\n"], "columns_format": [{}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "1", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "1", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "1", "align": "right"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "1", "align": "right"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-06-23T18:39:16.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["environment", "demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/vd3h-2qj7", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Particulate-Concentrations-by-sensor-u/vd3h-2qj7", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

The unemployment rate reflects the strength of the overall employment market.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nCalifornia Employment Development Department: Historical Unemployment Rates\n1990-2018\nhttps://data.edd.ca.gov/Labor-Force-and-Unemployment-Rates/Local-Area-Unemployment-Statistics-LAUS-Annual-Ave/7jbb-3rb8\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nUnemployment rates produced by EDD for the region and county levels are not adjusted for seasonality (as they reflect annual data) and are final data (i.e., not preliminary). Unemployment rates produced by BLS for the metro regions are adjusted for seasonality; they reflect the primary MSA for the named region, except for the San Francisco Bay Area which uses the nine-county region.

While a significant share of residents may choose to rent, home prices represent a primary driver of housing affordability in a given region, county or city.\t\n\nDATA SOURCE\nZillow\nMedian Sale Price (1997-2018)\nhttp://www.zillow.com/research/data/\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics: Consumer Price Index\nAll Urban Consumers Data Table (1997-2018; specific to each metro area)\nhttp://data.bls.gov\n\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nMedian housing price estimates for the region, counties, cities, and zip code come from analysis of individual home sales by Zillow. The median sale price is the price separating the higher half of the sales from the lower half. In other words, 50 percent of home sales are below or above the median value. Zillow defines all homes as single-family residential, condominium, and co-operative homes with a county record. Single-family residences are detached, which means the home is an individual structure with its own lot. Condominiums are units that you own in a multi-unit complex, such as an apartment building.

Regional and local geographies rely on data collected by real Answers, a research organization and database publisher specializing in the multifamily housing market. real Answers focuses on collecting longitudinal data for individual rental properties through quarterly surveys. For the Bay Area, their database is comprised of properties with 40 to 3,000+ housing units. Median list prices most likely have an upward bias due to the exclusion of smaller properties. The bias may be most extreme in geographies where large rental properties represent a small portion of the overall rental market. A map of the individual properties surveyed is included in the Local Focus section. \r\n\r\nIndividual properties surveyed provided lower- and upper-bound ranges for the various types of housing available (studio, 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, etc.). Median lower- and upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the regional and county geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the average of the median lower- and upper-bound prices for the region and counties. Median upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the city geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the median upper-bound price for cities. For simplicity, only the mean list rent is displayed for the individual properties. The metro areas geography rely upon Zillow data, which is the median price for rentals listed through www.zillow.com during the month. Like the real Answers data, Zillow's median list prices most likely have an upward bias since small properties are underrepresented in Zillow's listings. The metro area data for the Bay Area cannot be compared to the regional Bay Area data. Due to afore mentioned data limitations, this data is suitable for analyzing the change in list rents over time but not necessarily comparisons of absolute list rents. Metro area boundaries reflects today\u2019s metro area definitions by county for consistency, rather than historical metro area boundaries.\r\n\r\nDue to the limited number of rental properties surveyed, city-level data is unavailable for Atherton, Belvedere, Brisbane, Calistoga, Clayton, Cloverdale, Cotati, Fairfax, Half Moon Bay, Healdsburg, Hillsborough, Los Altos Hills, Monte Sereno, Moranga, Oakley, Orinda, Portola Valley, Rio Vista, Ross, San Anselmo, San Carlos, Saratoga, Sebastopol, Windsor, Woodside, and Yountville.\r\n\r\nInflation-adjusted data are presented to illustrate how rents have grown relative to overall price increases; that said, the use of the Consumer Price Index does create some challenges given the fact that housing represents a major chunk of consumer goods bundle used to calculate CPI.

{"resource": {"name": "CTCAC HCD Resource Opportunity Areas 2022", "id": "vr7h-smni", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "In 2017, the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee (TCAC) and the Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) created the California Fair Housing Task Force (Task Force). The Task Force was asked to assist TCAC and HCD in creating evidence-based approaches to increasing access to opportunity for families with children living in housing subsidized by the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program.\n\nThis feature set contains Resource Opportunity Areas (ROAs) that are the results of the Task Force's analysis for the two regions used for the San Francisco Bay Region; one is for the cities and towns (urban) and the other is for the rural areas. The reason for treating urban and rural areas as separate reasons is that using absolute thresholds for place-based opportunity could introduce comparisons between very different areas of the total region that make little sense from a policy perspective \u2014 in effect, holding a farming community to the same standard as a dense, urbanized neighborhood.\n\nROA analysis for urban areas is based on Census tract data. Since tracts in rural areas of are approximately 37 times larger in land area than tracts in non-rural areas, tract-level data in rural areas may mask over variation in opportunity and resources within these tracts. Assessing opportunity at the block group level in rural areas reduces this difference by 90 percent (each rural tract contains three block groups), and thus allows for finer-grained analysis.\n\nIn addition, more consistent standards can be useful for identifying areas of concern from a fair housing perspective \u2014 such as high-poverty and racially segregated areas. Assessing these factors based on intraregional comparison could mischaracterize areas in more affluent areas with relatively even and equitable development opportunity patterns as high-poverty, and could generate misleading results in areas with higher shares of objectively poor neighborhoods by holding them to a lower, intraregional standard.\n\nTo avoid either outcome, the Task Force used a hybrid approach for the TCAC/HCD ROA analysis \u2014 accounting for regional differences in assessing opportunity for most places, while applying more rigid standards for high-poverty, racially segregated areas in all regions. In particular:\n\nFiltering for High-Poverty, Racially Segregated Areas\nThe TCAC/HCD ROA filters areas that meet consistent standards for both poverty (30% of the population below the federal poverty line) and racial segregation (overrepresentation of people of color relative to the county) into a \u201cHigh Segregation & Poverty\u201d category. The share of each region that falls into the High Segregation & Poverty category varies from region to region.\n\nCalculating Index Scores for Non-Filtered Areas\nThe TCAC/HCD ROAs process calculates regionally derived opportunity index scores for non-filtered tracts and rural block groups using twenty-one indicators (see Data Quality section of metadata for more information). These index scores make it possible to sort each non-filtered tract or rural block group into opportunity categories according to their rank within the urban or rural areas.\n\nTo allow TCAC and HCD to incentivize equitable development patterns in each region to the same degree, the TCAC/HCD analysis 20 percent of tracts or rural block groups in each urban or rural area, respectively, with the highest relative index scores to the \"Highest Resource\u201d designation and the next 20 percent to the \u201cHigh Resource\u201d designation.\n\nThe region's urban area thus ends up with 40 percent of its total tracts with reliable data as Highest or High Resource (or 40 percent of block groups in the rural area). The remaining non-filtered tracts or rural block groups are then evenly divided into \u201cLow Resource\u201d and \u201cModerate Resource\u201d categories.\n\nExcluding Tracts or Block Groups\nThe analysis also excludes certain census areas from being categorized.

Calculated using a three-year moving average, PCI ranges from zero (failed) to 100 (brand-new) and has been used as a regional indicator of pavement preservation for over a decade.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nMetropolitan Transportation Commission: StreetSaver\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nPavement condition index (PCI) relies upon a three-year moving average for regional, county and city PCI to improve the reliability of the PCI data on an annual basis. The index ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 representing a failed road and 100 representing a brand-new facility. Segment PCI data is collected on a rolling basis but is imputed for interim years based on facility age and treatments using the MTC StreetSaver system. Pavement condition data was not collected in 2008. As such, 2007 and 2009 PCI scores were averaged to compute a 2008 estimate for the region, county and city datasets. Due to a lack of reported PCI data for the city of Palo Alto in 2007, an average could not be calculated, so Palo Alto is not included in the Regional Distribution chart.", "attribution": "MTC StreetSaver", "attribution_link": "https://www.streetsaver.com/", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-10-15T03:16:14.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-10-15T03:09:32.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-10-15T03:16:14.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-10-15T03:12:49.000Z", "columns_name": ["Source", "Region", "3YRAvgChange", "3YRAverage", "Year"], "columns_field_name": ["source", "region", "_3yravgchange", "_3yraverage", "year"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "Change in average pavement condition index between 2014-2017 and 2015-2018", "Average pavement condition index 2015-2018", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-10-15T03:12:49.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["infrastructure", "transportation", "demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/vys4-7jxj", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Street-Pavement-Condition-Bay-Area-Upd/vys4-7jxj", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

A permitted unit is a unit that a city or county has authorized for construction.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nConstruction Industry Research Board\nTable 3: Residential Units and Valuation (1967-2010)\nNo link available\n\nCalifornia Housing Foundation/Construction Industry Research Board\nCalifornia Construction Trends (2011-2013)\nhttp://www.mychf.org/cirb/\n\nAssociation of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) \u2013 Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC)\nHousing Permits Database (2014-2017)\nhttp://opendata.mtc.ca.gov\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nBay Area housing permits data prior to 2014 comes from the California Housing Foundation/Construction Industry Research Board. Data from 2014 to 2017 comes from the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) \u2013 Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) Housing Permits Database.\n\nSingle-family housing units include detached, semi-detached, row house and town house units. Row houses and town houses are included as single-family units when each unit is separated from the adjacent unit by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Condominiums are included as single-family units when they are of zero-lot-line or zero-property-line construction; when units are separated by an air space; or, when units are separated by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Multi-family housing includes duplexes, three-to-four-unit structures and apartment-type structures with five units or more. Multi-family also includes condominium units in structures of more than one living unit that do not meet the single-family housing definition. In the permits data from 2014 to 2017, single-family units include all units not strictly classified as multi-family. This may include secondary units.\n\nEach multi-family unit is counted separately even though they may be in the same building. Total units is the sum of single-family and multi-family units. County data is available from 1967 whereas city data is available from 1990. City data is only available for incorporated cities and towns. All permits in unincorporated cities and towns are included under their respective county\u2019s unincorporated total. Permit data is not available for years when the city or town was not incorporated.\n\nAffordable housing is the total number of permitted units affordable to low and very low income households. Housing affordable to very low income households are households making below 50% of the area median income. Housing affordable to low income households are households making between 50% and 80% of the area median income. Housing affordable to moderate income households are households making below 80% and 120% of the area median income. Housing affordable to above moderate income households are households making above 120% of the area median income.\n\nPermit data is missing for the following cities and years:\nClayton, 1990-2007\nLafayette, 1990-2007\nMoraga, 1990-2007\nOrinda, 1990-2007\nSan Ramon, 1990\n\nBuilding permit data for metropolitan areas for each year is the sum of non-seasonally adjusted monthly estimates from the Building Permit Survey. The Bay Area values are the sum of the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward MSA and the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara MSA. The counties included in these areas are: San Francisco, Marin, Contra Costa, Alameda, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and San Benito.\n\nPermit values reflect the number of units permitted in each respective year.", "attribution": "ABAG Housing Permit Database", "attribution_link": "http://housing.abag.ca.gov/#permits", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-03-11T22:22:56.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-10-31T21:53:13.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-03-11T22:22:56.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-03-11T22:21:14.000Z", "columns_name": ["County", "VeryLow_Share", "TOTALunits", "Low_Share", "Moderateunits", "Affordableunits", "Moderate_Share", "Source", "Lowunits", "SF_Share", "AboveModerate_Share", "AboveModerateunits", "Year", "SFunits", "VeryLowunits", "Affordableunits_Share", "MF_Share", "MFunits"], "columns_field_name": ["county", "verylow_share", "totalunits", "low_share", "moderateunits", "affordableunits", "moderate_share", "source", "lowunits", "sf_share", "abovemoderate_share", "abovemoderateunits", "year", "sfunits", "verylowunits", "affordableunits_share", "mf_share", "mfunits"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "Share of units for which permits were issued that are affordable at below 50% Area Median Income ", "Total number of units for which permits were issued", "Share of units for which permits were issued that are affordable at 50% to 80% Area Median Income", "Number of units for which permits were issued affordable at 80% to 120% Area Median Income", "Number of units for which permits were issued that are affordable at below 80% Area Median Income", "Share of units for which permits were issued that are affordable at 80% to 120% Area Median Income", "", "Number of units for which permits were issued affordable at 50% to 80% Area Median Income", "Share of units for which permits were issued that are single-family units", "Share of units for which permits were issued that are affordable at over 120% Area Median Income", "Number of units for which permits were issued affordable at over 120% Area Median Income", "", "Number of single-family units for which permits were issued", "Number of units for which permits were issued affordable at below 50% Area Median Income", "Share of units for which permits were issued that are affordable at below 80% Area Median Income", "Share of units for which permits were issued that are multi-family units", "Number of multi-family units for which permits were issued"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-11-14T19:46:21.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["environment", "infrastructure", "housing & development"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/wbvu-rmp6", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Housing-Permits-Bay-Area/wbvu-rmp6", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

While a significant share of residents may choose to rent, home prices represent a primary driver of housing affordability in a given region, county or city.\t\n\nDATA SOURCE\nZillow\nMedian Sale Price (1997-2018)\nhttp://www.zillow.com/research/data/\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics: Consumer Price Index\nAll Urban Consumers Data Table (1997-2018; specific to each metro area)\nhttp://data.bls.gov\n\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nMedian housing price estimates for the region, counties, cities, and zip code come from analysis of individual home sales by Zillow. The median sale price is the price separating the higher half of the sales from the lower half. In other words, 50 percent of home sales are below or above the median value. Zillow defines all homes as single-family residential, condominium, and co-operative homes with a county record. Single-family residences are detached, which means the home is an individual structure with its own lot. Condominiums are units that you own in a multi-unit complex, such as an apartment building. Co-operative homes are slightly different from condominiums where the homeowners own shares in the corporation that owns the building, not the actual units themselves. \n\nFor metropolitan area comparison values, the Bay Area metro area\u2019s median home sale price is the population-weighted average of the nine counties\u2019 median home prices.

The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, mode and operator tables for per-capita annual boardings (for an average resident in the given region or service area).\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE\r\nFederal Transit Administration: National Transit Database\r\nhttp://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION\r\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\r\nParatransit data is sparse in early years of the NTD dataset, meaning that transit ridership estimates in the early 1990s are likely underestimated. Simple modes were aggregated to combine the various bus modes (e.g. rapid bus, express bus, local bus) into a single mode to avoid incorrect conclusions resulting from mode recoding over the lifespan of NTD. \r\n\r\n2016 data should be considered preliminary, as it is derived from the monthly data tables rather than the longer-term time-series dataset. The unlinked passenger trips recorded in NTD's Monthly Module Adjusted Data Release database is used to calculate 2016 year-over-year change in ridership. The calculated 2016 growth rate is applied to the 2015 annual unlinked passenger trips recorded in the TS2.1 - Service Dta and Operating Expenses Time-Series by Mode to estimate 2016 ridership numbers. 2016 ridership estimates were not made for small operators that did not report monthly ridership numbers. For the Bay Area, this means 2016 ridership estimates are unavailable for Union City Transit (UCT) and Vacaville City Coach. Due to the omission of some small operators from 2016 estimates, regional and metro ridership numbers are likely slightly underestimated. Weekday ridership is calculated by taking the total annual ridership and dividing by 300, an assumption which is consistent with MTC travel modeling procedures; it was also compared to observed weekday boarding data (which is more limited in availability) to ensure consistency on the regional level. Per-capita transit ridership is calculated for the operator's general service area or taxation district; for example, BART includes the three core counties (San Francisco, Alameda, and Contra Costa) as well as northern San Mateo County post-SFO extension and AC Transit includes the cities located within its service area. ACE per-capita transit ridership is calculated using the population of Alameda and San Joaquin counties. For other metro areas, operators were identified by developing a list of all urbanized areas within a current MSA boundary and then using that UZA list to flag relevant operators; this means that all operators (both large and small) were included in the metro comparison data.", "attribution": "Federal Transit Administration: National Transit Database", "attribution_link": "http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2018-07-06T18:04:39.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-05-24T20:49:41.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-07-06T18:04:39.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-06-05T22:26:27.000Z", "columns_name": ["System", "Source2", "PerCapita_Annual_Boardings", "System_Full_Name", "Source1", "PercentChg_1991", "Annual_Boardings", "Population", "Year"], "columns_field_name": ["system", "source2", "percapita_annual_boardings", "system_full_name", "source1", "percentchg_1991", "annual_boardings", "population", "year"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "Annual transit boardings per-capita (per resident of service area)", "", "", "Percent change from 1991 ridership levels", "Annual passenger boardings", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "1", "align": "right"}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "4", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "0", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "0", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-06-05T22:28:37.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["transportation", "health", "economy"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/wdpr-f2dr", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Transit-Ridership-per-Capita-by-operat/wdpr-f2dr", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

At a minimum, the HUs are delineated at 1:24,000-scale in the conterminous United States, 1:25,000-scale in Hawaii, Pacific basin and the Caribbean, and 1:63,360-scale in Alaska, meeting the National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS). Higher resolution boundaries are being developed where partners and data exist and will be incorporated back into the WBD. WBD data are delivered as a dataset of polygons and corresponding lines that define the boundary of the polygon. WBD polygon attributes include hydrologic unit codes (HUC), size (in the form of acres and square kilometers), name, downstream hydrologic unit code, type of watershed, non-contributing areas, and flow modifications.

Regional and local geographies rely on data collected by real Answers, a research organization and database publisher specializing in the multifamily housing market. real Answers focuses on collecting longitudinal data for individual rental properties through quarterly surveys. For the Bay Area, their database is comprised of properties with 40 to 3,000+ housing units. Median list prices most likely have an upward bias due to the exclusion of smaller properties. The bias may be most extreme in geographies where large rental properties represent a small portion of the overall rental market. A map of the individual properties surveyed is included in the Local Focus section. \r\n\r\nIndividual properties surveyed provided lower- and upper-bound ranges for the various types of housing available (studio, 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, etc.). Median lower- and upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the regional and county geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the average of the median lower- and upper-bound prices for the region and counties. Median upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the city geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the median upper-bound price for cities. For simplicity, only the mean list rent is displayed for the individual properties. The metro areas geography rely upon Zillow data, which is the median price for rentals listed through www.zillow.com during the month. Like the real Answers data, Zillow's median list prices most likely have an upward bias since small properties are underrepresented in Zillow's listings. The metro area data for the Bay Area cannot be compared to the regional Bay Area data. Due to afore mentioned data limitations, this data is suitable for analyzing the change in list rents over time but not necessarily comparisons of absolute list rents. Metro area boundaries reflects today\u2019s metro area definitions by county for consistency, rather than historical metro area boundaries.\r\n\r\nDue to the limited number of rental properties surveyed, city-level data is unavailable for Atherton, Belvedere, Brisbane, Calistoga, Clayton, Cloverdale, Cotati, Fairfax, Half Moon Bay, Healdsburg, Hillsborough, Los Altos Hills, Monte Sereno, Moranga, Oakley, Orinda, Portola Valley, Rio Vista, Ross, San Anselmo, San Carlos, Saratoga, Sebastopol, Windsor, Woodside, and Yountville.\r\n\r\nInflation-adjusted data are presented to illustrate how rents have grown relative to overall price increases; that said, the use of the Consumer Price Index does create some challenges given the fact that housing represents a major chunk of consumer goods bundle used to calculate CPI. This reflects a methodological tradeoff between precision and accuracy and is a common concern when working with any commodity that is a major component of CPI itself.  Percent change in inflation-adjusted median is calculated with respect to the median price from the fourth quarter or December of the base year.", "attribution": "real Answers", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2018-07-06T18:06:29.000Z", "createdAt": "2016-10-31T23:40:39.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-07-06T18:06:29.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2016-12-08T00:38:11.000Z", "columns_name": ["Latitude", "AverageRent", "County", "Source", "Longitude", "Structures", "Year Built", "Units", "Zipcode", "City", "Address", "Name", "Year"], "columns_field_name": ["latitude", "averagerent", "county", "source", "longitude", "structures", "year_built", "units", "zipcode", "city", "address", "name", "year"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "0", "align": "right"}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "rdf": "", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2016-12-08T00:40:08.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["finance", "health", "infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/wfp9-cb9q", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-List-Rents-by-property/wfp9-cb9q", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

Congestion is defined as speeds less than 35 mph, the level at which freeway throughput is maximized. The dataset includes regional and county tables for congested share of freeway miles driven.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nMTC/Caltrans: Performance Monitoring System (PeMS) Congested Mileage Analysis\n2004-2016\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nCongested VMT data only includes freeway facilities and relies upon PeMS traffic data. They reflect delay on a typical weekday, which is defined as Tuesday through Thursday during peak traffic months. Delay statistics emphasize recurring delay - i.e. consistent delay greater than 15 minutes on a specific freeway segment. Congested delay is defined as congestion occurring with speeds less than 35 mph and is commonly recognized as inefficient delay (meaning that the freeway corridor is operating at speeds low enough to reduce throughput - as opposed to speeds greater than 35 mph which increase throughput).", "attribution": "MTC", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2018-07-10T01:39:25.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-05-11T20:46:23.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-07-10T01:39:25.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-05-11T20:46:29.000Z", "columns_name": ["Year", "Source", "Region", "Congest_Share"], "columns_field_name": ["year", "source", "region", "congest_share"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "Share of freeway miles traveled in congestion [to convert to %, multiply by 100]"], "columns_format": [{"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "3", "align": "right"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-05-11T20:50:29.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/wftq-cs7m", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Miles-Traveled-in-Congestion-Bay-Area/wftq-cs7m", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

A Priority Development Area (PDA) is a locally-designated area with frequent transit service, where a jurisdiction has decided to concentrate most of its housing and jobs growth for development in the foreseeable future. PDA boundaries are current as of August 2019. For more information on PDA designation see http://gis.abag.ca.gov/website/PDAShowcase/.\n\nPopulation estimates for Bay Area counties and cities are from the California Department of Finance, which are as of January 1st of each year. Population estimates for non-Bay Area regions are from the U.S. Census Bureau. Decennial Census years reflect population as of April 1st of each year whereas population estimates for intercensal estimates are as of July 1st of each year. Population estimates for Bay Area tracts are from the decennial Census (1970 -2010) and the American Community Survey (2008-2012 5-year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average; 2013-2017 5-year rolling average).

Population estimates for PDAs are derived from Census population counts at the tract level for 1970-1990 and at the block group level for 2000-2017. Population from either tracts or block groups are allocated to a PDA using an area ratio. For example, if a quarter of a Census block group lies with in a PDA, a quarter of its population will be allocated to that PDA. Tract-to-PDA and block group-to-PDA area ratios are calculated using gross acres. Estimates of population density for PDAs use gross acres as the denominator.\n\n\nAnnual population estimates for metropolitan areas outside the Bay Area are from the Census and are benchmarked to each decennial Census.

The data reflect the median monthly rent paid by Bay Area households across apartments and homes of various sizes and various levels of quality. This differs from advertised rents for available apartments, which usually are higher. Note that rent can be presented using nominal or real (inflation-adjusted) dollar values; data are presented inflation-adjusted to reflect changes in household purchasing power over time.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census  \nCount 2 (1970)  \nForm STF1 (1980-1990)  \nForm SF3a (2000)  \nhttps://nhgis.org\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey  \nForm B25058 (2005-2021; median contract rent)  \nhttps://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics: Consumer Price Index  \n1970-2021  \nhttps://www.bls.gov/data/\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nRent data reflects median rent payments rather than list rents (refer to measure definition above). American Community Survey 1-year data is used for larger geographies \u2013 Bay counties and most metropolitan area counties \u2013 while smaller geographies rely upon 5-year rolling average data due to their smaller sample sizes. Note that 2020 data uses the 5-year estimates since 1-year data was not collected for 2020 (see https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-1year.2020.html).\n\n1970 Census data for median rent payments has been imputed from quintiles using methodology from California Department of Finance as the source data only provided the mean, rather than the median, monthly rent.

A permitted unit is a unit that a city or county has authorized for construction.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nCalifornia Housing Foundation/Construction Industry Research Board (CIRB)  \nConstruction Review report (1967-2022)  \nhttps://www.cirbreport.org/\n\nAssociation of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) \u2013 Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC)  \nHousing Permits Database (2014-2021)  \nhttps://data.bayareametro.gov/Development/HCD-Annual-Progress-Report-Jurisdiction-Summary/nxbj-gfv7\n\nCensus Bureau Building Permit Survey  \nBuilding permits by county (annual, monthly)  \nhttps://www2.census.gov/econ/bps/County/\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nBay Area housing permits data by single/multi family come from the California Housing Foundation/Construction Industry Research Board (CIRB). Affordability breakdowns from 2014 to 2021 come from the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) \u2013 Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) Housing Permits Database.\n\nSingle-family housing units include detached, semi-detached, row house and town house units. Row houses and town houses are included as single-family units when each unit is separated from the adjacent unit by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Condominiums are included as single-family units when they are of zero-lot-line or zero-property-line construction; when units are separated by an air space; or, when units are separated by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Multi-family housing includes duplexes, three-to-four-unit structures and apartment-type structures with five units or more. Multi-family also includes condominium units in structures of more than one living unit that do not meet the single-family housing definition.\n\nEach multi-family unit is counted separately even though they may be in the same building. Total units is the sum of single-family and multi-family units. County data is available from 1967 whereas city data is available from 1990. City data is only available for incorporated cities and towns. All permits in unincorporated cities and towns are included under their respective county\u2019s unincorporated total. Permit data is not available for years when the city or town was not incorporated.\n\nAffordable housing is the total number of permitted units affordable to low and very low income households. Housing affordable to very low income households are households making below 50% of the area median income. Housing affordable to low income households are households making between 50% and 80% of the area median income. Housing affordable to moderate income households are households making below 80% and 120% of the area median income. Housing affordable to above moderate income households are households making above 120% of the area median income.\n\nPermit data is missing for the following cities and years:  \nClayton, 1990-2007  \nLafayette, 1990-2007  \nMoraga, 1990-2007  \nOrinda, 1990-2007  \nSan Ramon, 1990\n\nBuilding permit data for metropolitan areas for each year is the sum of non-seasonally adjusted monthly estimates from the Census Building Permit Survey. The Bay Area values are the sum of the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward MSA and the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara MSA. The counties included in these areas are: San Francisco, Marin, Contra Costa, Alameda, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and San Benito.\n\nPermit values reflect the number of units permitted in each respective year.

City data was thus discarded due to this limitation and the analysis only examine county and regional data, where through-trips are generally less common.\r\n\r\nThe metropolitan area comparison was performed by summing all of the urbanized areas within each metropolitan area (9-nine region for the San Francisco Bay Area and the primary MSA for all others). For the metro analysis, no VMT data is available outside of other urbanized areas; it is only available for intraregional analysis purposes.\r\n\r\nVMT per capita is calculated by dividing VMT by an estimate of the traveling population.

While \u201cat risk\u201d households may not necessarily be displaced in the short-term or long-term, neighborhoods identified as being \u201cat risk\u201d signify pressure as reflected by the decline in lower-income households (who are presumed to relocate to other more affordable communities).

Historical data is pulled from U.S. Census datasets and aligned with today\u2019s census tract boundaries using crosswalk tables provided by LTDB. Tract data, as well as regional income data, are calculated using 5-year rolling averages for consistency \u2013 given that tract data is only available on a 5-year basis. Using household tables by income level, the number of households in each tract falling below the median are summed, which involves summing all brackets below the regional median and then summing a fractional share of the bracket that includes the regional median (assuming a simple linear distribution within that bracket).\n\nOnce all tracts in a given county or metro area are synced to today\u2019s boundaries, the analysis identifies census tracts of greater than 500 lower-income people (in the prior year) to filter out low-population areas. For those tracts, any net loss between the prior year and the analysis year results in that tract being flagged as being at risk of displacement, and all lower-income households in that tract are flagged. To calculate the share of households at risk, the number of lower-income households living in flagged tracts are summed and divided by the total number of lower-income households living in the larger geography (county or metro). Minor deviations on a year-to-year basis should be taken in context, given that data on the tract level often fluctuates and has a significant margin of error; changes on the county and regional level are more appropriate to consider on an annual basis instead.", "attribution": "U.S. Census Bureau", "attribution_link": "http://api.census.gov", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-08-13T16:05:02.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-12-12T22:47:20.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-08-13T16:05:02.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2018-12-12T22:50:32.000Z", "columns_name": ["Source3", "LIHH_At_Risk", "LIHH_Total", "Source2", "Year", "Displacement_Risk", "Metro", "Source1"], "columns_field_name": ["source3", "lihh_at_risk", "lihh_total", "source2", "year", "displacement_risk", "metro", "source1"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "Number of lower-income households at risk of displacement", "Total number of lower-income households", "", "", "Share of lower-income households at risk of displacement", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-12-12T22:50:33.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "infrastructure", "environment"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/wx2e-8w6i", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Displacement-Risk-by-metro/wx2e-8w6i", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

To allow for historical comparisons, the Census Bureau merges housing expenditure brackets into three consistent bins (less than 20 percent, 20 percent to 34 percent, and more than 35 percent) that work for all years. The highest income bracket for renters in the ACS data was $100,000 or more, while the homeowner dataset included brackets for $100,000 to $149,999 and $150,000 and above. These brackets were merged together to allow for uniform comparison across tenure. While some studies use 30 percent as the affordability threshold, Vital Signs uses 35 percent as this is the closest break point using the standardized affordability brackets above. Historical data for Napa County is unavailable due to an insufficient sample size for renters in a number of years, making it impossible to calculate affordability for all households. All ACS data is for a single year, rather than a rolling average.

The footprint is defined as land occupied by structures, with a building density of at least 1 unit to 1.5 acres.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nDepartment of Conservation: Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program\nGIS Data Tables/Layers (1990-2016)\nhttps://www.conservation.ca.gov/dlrp/fmmp\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census\nPopulation by Census Block Group (2000-2010)\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey (5-year)\nPopulation by Census Block Group (2000-2017)\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nFor regional and local data, FMMP maps the extent of \u201curban and built-up\u201d lands, which generally reflect the developed urban footprint of the region. The footprint is defined as land occupied by structures with building density of at least 1 unit to 1.5 acres. Uses include residential, industrial, commercial, construction, institutional, public administration, railroad and other transportation yards, cemeteries, airports, golf courses, sanitary landfills, sewage treatment, water control structures, and other developed purposes.\n\nTo determine the amount of greenfield development (in acres) occurring in a given two-year period, the differences in urban footprint are computed on a county-level. FMMP makes slight refinements to urban boundaries over time, so changes in urban footprint +/- 100 acres are not regionally significant. The GIS shapefile represents the 2016 urban footprint and thus does not show previously urbanized land outside of the footprint (i.e. Hamilton Air Force Base).\n\nFor metro comparisons, a different methodology had to be used to avoid the geospatial limitations associated with FMMP. U.S. Census population by census block group was gathered for each metro area for 2000, 2010, and 2017. Population data for years 2000 and 2010 come from the Decennial Census while data for 2018 comes from the 2017 5-year American Community Survey. The block group was considered urbanized if its average/gross density was greater than 1 housing unit per acre (a slightly higher threshold than FMMP uses for its definition). Because a block group cannot be flagged as partially urbanized, and non-residential uses are not fully captured, the urban footprint of the region calculated with this methodology is smaller than in FMMP. The metro data should be primarily used for looking at comparative growth rate in greenfield development rather than the acreage totals themselves.", "attribution": "Farmland Mapping & Monitoring Program", "attribution_link": "https://www.conservation.ca.gov/dlrp/fmmp", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2020-07-03T16:36:18.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-11-14T20:48:13.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-07-03T16:36:18.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-11-15T22:36:27.000Z", "columns_name": ["Share_of_Region_Change_2010", "Year", "Share_of_Region_Change_2000", "Change_Urban_Acres_2010", "Change_Urban_Acres_2000", "Change_Urban_Acres_1990", "Urban_Acres", "County", "Share_of_Region_Change_1990", "Source"], "columns_field_name": ["share_of_region_change_2010", "year", "share_of_region_change_2000", "change_urban_acres_2010", "change_urban_acres_2000", "change_urban_acres_1990", "urban_acres", "county", "share_of_region_change_1990", "source"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Share of regional change in urbanized acres since 2010", "", "Share of regional change in urbanized acres since 2000", "Percent change in urbanized acres since 2010", "Percent change in urbanized acres since 2000", "Percent change in urbanized acres since 1990", "Number of urbanized acres", "", "Share of regional change in urbanized acres since 1990", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-11-14T20:50:21.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["environment", "demographics", "infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/x8pj-558q", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Greenfield-Development-by-county/x8pj-558q", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, county, city and census tract tables by place of residence.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census (1960-2000) - via MTC/ABAG Bay Area Census  \nhttp://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/transportation/Means19602000.htm  \nhttp://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/transportation/Means19802000.htm\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey  \n2006-2021  \nForm B08301  \nForm B08301  \nwww.api.census.gov\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nFor the decennial Census datasets, the breakdown of auto commuters between drive alone and carpool is not available before 1980. \"Other\" includes bicycle, motorcycle, taxi, and other modes of transportation. American Community Survey 1-year data is used for larger geographies \u2013 Bay counties and most metropolitan area counties \u2013 while smaller geographies rely upon 5-year rolling average data due to their smaller sample sizes. Note that 2020 data uses the 5-year estimates since 1-year data was not collected for 2020 (see https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-1year.2020.html). Additionally, for the County [by place of residence] breakdown, Napa was missing ACS 1-Year commute mode choice data for all modes for 2007, 2008, 2011, and 2021. 5-Year estimates were used to fill the missing data for 2011 and 2021, but not 2007 or 2008 since the 5-Year estimates start in 2009.\n\nRegional mode shares are population-weighted averages of the nine counties' modal shares. \"Auto\" includes drive alone and carpool for the simple data tables and is broken out in the detailed data tables accordingly, as it was not available before 1980. \"Transit\" includes public operators (Muni, BART, etc.) and employer-provided shuttles (e.g., Google shuttle buses). \"Other\" includes motorcycle, taxi, and other modes of transportation; bicycle mode share was broken out separately for the first time in the 2006 data and is shown in the detailed data tables. Census tract data is not available for tracts with insufficient numbers of residents or workers.\n\nThe metropolitan area comparison was performed for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area in addition to the primary MSAs for other major metropolitan areas.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-02-15T20:51:46.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-07-08T00:23:55.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-02-15T20:51:46.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-09-23T22:04:26.000Z", "columns_name": ["Share", "Mode", "Year", "County", "Source", "Data_Type"], "columns_field_name": ["share", "mode", "year", "county", "source", "data_type"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-07-08T00:23:57.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/xcep-e2qd", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Commute-Mode-Choice-by-Place-of-Employ/xcep-e2qd", "owner": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}, "creator": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}}

To allow for historical comparisons, the Census Bureau merges housing expenditure brackets into three consistent bins (less than 20 percent, 20 percent to 34 percent, and more than 35 percent) that work for all years. The highest income bracket for renters in the ACS data was $100,000 or more, while the homeowner dataset included brackets for $100,000 to $149,999 and $150,000 and above. These brackets were merged together to allow for uniform comparison across tenure. While some studies use 30 percent as the affordability threshold, Vital Signs uses 35 percent as this is the closest break point using the standardized affordability brackets above. Historical data for Napa County is unavailable due to an insufficient sample size for renters in a number of years, making it impossible to calculate affordability for all households. All ACS data is for a single year, rather than a rolling average.

The national poverty level does not vary geographically even though cost of living is different across the United States. For the Bay Area, where cost of living is high and incomes are correspondingly high, an appropriate poverty level is 200% of poverty or twice the national poverty level, consistent with what was used for past equity work at MTC and ABAG. For comparison, however, both the national and 200% poverty levels are presented. \n\nFor Vital Signs, the poverty rate is defined as the number of people (including children) living below twice the poverty level divided by the number of people for whom poverty status is determined. The household income definitions for poverty change each year to reflect inflation. The official poverty definition uses money income before taxes and does not include capital gains or noncash benefits (such as public housing, Medicaid, and food stamps). For the national poverty level definitions by year, see: https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/data/threshld/index.html\nFor an explanation on how the Census Bureau measures poverty, see: https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/about/overview/measure.html\n\nAmerican Community Survey 1-year data is used for larger geographies \u2013 Bay counties and most metropolitan area counties \u2013 while smaller geographies rely upon 5-year rolling average data due to their smaller sample sizes.

Affordability breakdowns from 2014 to 2021 come from the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) \u2013 Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) Housing Permits Database.\n\nSingle-family housing units include detached, semi-detached, row house and town house units. Row houses and town houses are included as single-family units when each unit is separated from the adjacent unit by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Condominiums are included as single-family units when they are of zero-lot-line or zero-property-line construction; when units are separated by an air space; or, when units are separated by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Multi-family housing includes duplexes, three-to-four-unit structures and apartment-type structures with five units or more. Multi-family also includes condominium units in structures of more than one living unit that do not meet the single-family housing definition.\n\nEach multi-family unit is counted separately even though they may be in the same building. Total units is the sum of single-family and multi-family units. County data is available from 1967 whereas city data is available from 1990. City data is only available for incorporated cities and towns. All permits in unincorporated cities and towns are included under their respective county\u2019s unincorporated total. Permit data is not available for years when the city or town was not incorporated.\n\nAffordable housing is the total number of permitted units affordable to low and very low income households.

In the Bay Area, ozone is measured by over a dozen monitoring stations that record hourly concentrations used to determine compliance with national standards. These hourly data are used to calculate eight-hour peak ozone levels for the fourth-worst day of the year, the most common indicator of ozone performance.

Data are used to calculate the 8-hour peak concentration for ozone. The fourth-highest day of the year is identified and then reported as a three-year rolling average to minimize noise associated with any given year. These averaged are compared to the national air quality standard to determine compliance. The worst location site may shift from year to year depending on which sensor location had the highest levels of ozone over that particular time period.", "attribution": "Bay Area Air Quality Management District", "attribution_link": "http://www.baaqmd.gov/about-air-quality/air-quality-summaries", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2018-07-06T18:04:30.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-06-23T21:27:28.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-07-06T18:04:30.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-06-23T21:28:52.000Z", "columns_name": ["Ozone_Max4_Daily_8HR_ppb_WorstLocation_3YR", "Ozone_Max4_Daily_8HR_ppb_Annual_1YR", "Year", "Ozone_Max4_Daily_8HR_ppb_Annual_3YR_Standard", "Ozone_Max4_Daily_8HR_ppb_WorstLocation_1YR", "Ozone_Max4_Daily_8HR_ppb_Annual_3YR", "Source", "Region"], "columns_field_name": ["ozone_max4_daily_8hr_ppb_worstlocation_3yr", "ozone_max4_daily_8hr_ppb_annual_1yr", "year", "ozone_max4_daily_8hr_ppb_annual_3yr_standard", "ozone_max4_daily_8hr_ppb_worstlocation_1yr", "ozone_max4_daily_8hr_ppb_annual_3yr", "source", "region"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Ozone concentrations (8-hour peak) - 4th worst day of year; 3-year rolling average (in parts per billion); worst sensor location in region\n", "Ozone concentrations (8-hour peak) - 4th worst day of year; 1-year (in parts per billion)\n", "", "Ozone concentrations (8-hour peak) - 4th worst day of year; 3-year rolling average (in parts per billion); standard set by EPA", "Ozone concentrations (8-hour peak) - 4th worst day of year; 1-year (in parts per billion); worst sensor location in region", "Ozone concentrations (8-hour peak) - 4th worst day of year; 3-year rolling average (in parts per billion)\n", "", ""], "columns_format": [{"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "1", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "1", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "1", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "1", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "1", "align": "right"}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-06-23T21:30:05.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "environment"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/xnph-99g9", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Ozone-Concentrations-Bay-Area-updated-/xnph-99g9", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

Life expectancy does not reflect how long any given individual is expected to live; rather, it is an artificial measure that captures an aspect of the mortality rates across a population that can be compared across time and populations. More information about the determinants of life expectancy that may lead to differences in life expectancy between neighborhoods can be found in the Bay Area Regional Health Inequities Initiative (BARHII) Health Inequities in the Bay Area report at http://www.barhii.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/barhii_hiba.pdf.  Vital Signs measures life expectancy at birth (as opposed to cohort life expectancy). A statistical model was used to estimate life expectancy for Bay Area counties and ZIP Codes based on current life tables which require both age and mortality data. A life table is a table which shows, for each age, the survivorship of a people from a certain population.\r\n\r\nCurrent life tables were created using death records and population estimates by age. The California Department of Public Health provided death records based on the California death certificate information. Records include age at death and residential ZIP Code. Single-year age population estimates at the regional- and county-level comes from the California Department of Finance population estimates and projections for ages 0-100+. Population estimates for ages 100 and over are aggregated to a single age interval. Using this data, death rates in a population within age groups for a given year are computed to form unabridged life tables (as opposed to abridged life tables). To calculate life expectancy, the probability of dying between the jth and (j+1)st birthday is assumed uniform after age 1. Special consideration is taken to account for infant mortality.\r\n\r\nFor the ZIP Code-level life expectancy calculation, it is assumed that postal ZIP Codes share the same boundaries as ZIP Code Census Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs). More information on the relationship between ZIP Codes and ZCTAs can be found at http://www.census.gov/geo/reference/zctas.html. ZIP Code-level data uses three years of mortality data to make robust estimates due to small sample size. Year 2013 ZIP Code life expectancy estimates reflects death records from 2011 through 2013. 2013 is the last year with available mortality data. Death records for ZIP Codes with zero population (like those associated with P.O. Boxes) were assigned to the nearest ZIP Code with population. ZIP Code population for 2000 estimates comes from the Decennial Census. ZIP Code population for 2013 estimates are from the American Community Survey (5-Year Average). ACS estimates are adjusted using Decennial Census data for more accurate population estimates.

Regional and local geographies rely on data collected by real Answers, a research organization and database publisher specializing in the multifamily housing market. real Answers focuses on collecting longitudinal data for individual rental properties through quarterly surveys. For the Bay Area, their database is comprised of properties with 40 to 3,000+ housing units. Median list prices most likely have an upward bias due to the exclusion of smaller properties. The bias may be most extreme in geographies where large rental properties represent a small portion of the overall rental market. A map of the individual properties surveyed is included in the Local Focus section. \r\n\r\nIndividual properties surveyed provided lower- and upper-bound ranges for the various types of housing available (studio, 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, etc.). Median lower- and upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the regional and county geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the average of the median lower- and upper-bound prices for the region and counties. Median upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the city geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the median upper-bound price for cities. For simplicity, only the mean list rent is displayed for the individual properties. The metro areas geography rely upon Zillow data, which is the median price for rentals listed through www.zillow.com during the month. Like the real Answers data, Zillow's median list prices most likely have an upward bias since small properties are underrepresented in Zillow's listings. The metro area data for the Bay Area cannot be compared to the regional Bay Area data. Due to afore mentioned data limitations, this data is suitable for analyzing the change in list rents over time but not necessarily comparisons of absolute list rents. Metro area boundaries reflects today\u2019s metro area definitions by county for consistency, rather than historical metro area boundaries.\r\n\r\nDue to the limited number of rental properties surveyed, city-level data is unavailable for Atherton, Belvedere, Brisbane, Calistoga, Clayton, Cloverdale, Cotati, Fairfax, Half Moon Bay, Healdsburg, Hillsborough, Los Altos Hills, Monte Sereno, Moranga, Oakley, Orinda, Portola Valley, Rio Vista, Ross, San Anselmo, San Carlos, Saratoga, Sebastopol, Windsor, Woodside, and Yountville.\r\n\r\nInflation-adjusted data are presented to illustrate how rents have grown relative to overall price increases; that said, the use of the Consumer Price Index does create some challenges given the fact that housing represents a major chunk of consumer goods bundle used to calculate CPI. This reflects a methodological tradeoff between precision and accuracy and is a common concern when working with any commodity that is a major component of CPI itself.  Percent change in inflation-adjusted median is calculated with respect to the median price from the fourth quarter or December of the base year.", "attribution": "real Answers", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2018-07-06T18:06:24.000Z", "createdAt": "2016-11-19T22:00:48.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-07-06T18:06:24.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2016-11-19T22:00:55.000Z", "columns_name": ["Median_List_Rent_IA_PercentChg_1994", "Median_List_Rent_PercentChg_1994", "Median_List_Rent_IA", "Median_List_Rent", "Year", "Metro", "Source"], "columns_field_name": ["median_list_rent_ia_percentchg_1994", "median_list_rent_percentchg_1994", "median_list_rent_ia", "median_list_rent", "year", "metro", "source"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "4", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "4", "align": "right"}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2016-11-19T22:03:19.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["finance", "health", "infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/y3f9-8xmx", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-List-Rents-Bay-Area/y3f9-8xmx", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

This measure reflects the changing industry trends that affect our region\u2019s workers.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nBureau of Labor Statistics, Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW)  \n1990-2021  \nhttps://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nQCEW employment data is reported by the place of work and represent the number of covered workers who worked during, or received pay for, the pay period that included the 12th day of the month. Covered employees in the private-sector and in the state and local government include most corporate officials, all executives, all supervisory personnel, all professionals, all clerical workers, many farmworkers, all wage earners, all piece workers, and all part-time workers. Workers on paid sick leave, paid holiday, paid vacation, and the like are also covered.\n\nBesides excluding the aforementioned national security agencies, QCEW excludes proprietors, the unincorporated self-employed, unpaid family members, certain farm and domestic workers from having to report employment data, and railroad workers covered by the railroad unemployment insurance system. Excluded as well are workers who earned no wages during the entire applicable pay period because of work stoppages, temporary layoffs, illness, or unpaid vacations. \n\nThe location quotient (LQ) is used to evaluate level of concentration or clustering of an industry within the Bay Area and within each county of the region. A location quotient greater than 1 means there is a strong concentration for of jobs in an industry sector. For the Bay Area, the LQ is calculated as the share of the region\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of California's employment in that same sector. For each county, the LQ is calculated as the share of the county\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the region\u2019s employment in that same sector.\n\nData is mainly pulled from aggregation level 73, which is county-level summarized at the NAICS supersector level (12 sectors). This aggregation level exhibits the least loss due to data suppression, in the magnitude of 1-2 percent for regional employment, and is therefore preferred. However, the supersectors group together NAICS 11 Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, and Hunting; NAICS 21 Mining, and NAICS 23 Construction. To provide a separate tally of Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, and Hunting, the aggregation level 74 data was used for NAICS codes 11, 21 and 23. \n\nQCEW reports on employment in Public Administration as NAICS 92. However, many government activities are reported with an industry specific code - such as transportation or utilities even if those may be public governmental entities. In 2021 for the Bay Area, the largest industry groupings under public ownership are Education and health services (58%); Public administration (29%), and Trade, transportation, and utilities (29%). With the exception of Education and health services, all other public activities were coded as government/public administration, regardless of industry group.\n\nFor the county data there were some industries that reported 0 jobs or did not report jobs at the desired aggregation/NAICS level for the following counties/years:\n\nFarm:  \n(aggregation level: 74, NAICS code: 11)\n- Contra Costa: 2008-2010\n- Marin: 1990-2006, 2008-2010, 2014-2020\n- Napa: 1990-2004, 2013-2021\n- San Francisco: 2019-2020\n- San Mateo: 2013\n\nInformation:  \n(aggregation level: 73, NAICS code: 51)\n- Solano: 2001\n\nFinancial Activities:  \n(aggregation level: 73, NAICS codes: 52, 53)\n- Solano: 2001\n\nUnclassified:  \n(aggregation level: 73, NAIC", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-02-16T05:05:13.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-06-10T00:59:23.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-02-16T05:05:13.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-07-06T20:51:17.000Z", "columns_name": ["Percentchange_1990", "Difference_1990", "Industry", "Year", "Objectid", "industry_name", "Source", "Geo_Name"], "columns_field_name": ["percentchange_1990", "difference_1990", "industry", "year", "objectid", "industry_name", "source", "geo_name"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["percentchange_1990", "difference_1990", "Industry", "Year", "objectid", "", "Source", "geo_name"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-07-06T20:30:43.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Economy", "domain_tags": ["ec1", "vital signs", "vital signs 2.0"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/y9r8-pr4c", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/Economy/Vital-Signs-Change-in-Jobs-by-Industry-Bay-Area-20/y9r8-pr4c", "owner": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}, "creator": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}}

In the San Francisco Bay Area, low-wage occupations have a median hourly wage of less than 80% of the regional median wage; median wages for middle-wage occupations range from 80% to 120% of the regional median wage, and high-wage occupations have a median hourly wage above 120% of the regional median wage.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nCalifornia Employment Development Department OES\n(2001-2017)\nhttp://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov/data/oes-employment-and-wages.html\n\nAmerican Community Survey\n(2001-2017)\nhttp://api.census.gov\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nJobs are determined to be low-, middle-, or high-wage based on the median hourly wage of their occupational classification in the most recent year. Low-wage jobs are those that pay below 80% of the regional median wage. Middle-wage jobs are those that pay between 80% and 120% of the regional median wage. High-wage jobs are those that pay above 120% of the regional median wage. Regional median hourly wages are estimated from the American Community Survey and are published on the Vital Signs Income indicator page. For the national context analysis, occupation wage classifications are unique to each metro area. A low-wage job in New York, for instance, may be a middle-wage job in Miami. For the Bay Area in 2017, the median hourly wage for low-wage occupations was less than $20.86 per hour. For middle-wage jobs, the median ranged from $20.86 to $31.30 per hour; and for high-wage jobs, the median wage was above $31.30 per hour.\n\nOccupational employment and wage information comes from the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) program. Regional and subregional data is published by the California Employment Development Department. Metro data is published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The OES program collects data on wage and salary workers in nonfarm establishments to produce employment and wage estimates for some 800 occupations. Data from non-incorporated self-employed persons are not collected, and are not included in these estimates. Wage estimates represent a three-year rolling average.\n\nDue to changes in reporting during the analysis period, subregion data from the EDD OES have been aggregated to produce geographies that can be compared over time. West Bay is San Mateo, San Francisco, and Marin counties. North Bay is Sonoma, Solano and Napa counties. East Bay is Alameda and Contra Costa counties. South Bay is Santa Clara County from 2001-2004 and Santa Clara and San Benito counties from 2005-2017.\n\nDue to changes in occupation classifications during the analysis period, all occupations have been reassigned to 2010 SOC codes. For pre-2009 reporting years, all employment in occupations that were split into two or more 2010 SOC occupations are assigned to the first 2010 SOC occupation listed in the crosswalk table provided by the Census Bureau. This method assumes these occupations always fall in the same wage category, and sensitivity analysis of this reassignment method shows this is true in most cases.\n\nIn order to use OES data for time series analysis, several steps were taken to handle missing wage or employment data. For some occupations, such as airline pilots and flight attendants, no wage information was provided and these were removed from the analysis. Other occupations did not record a median hourly wage (mostly due to irregular work hours) but did record an annual average wage. Nearly all these occupations were in education (i.e. teachers). In this case, a 2080 hour-work year was assumed and [annual average wage/2080] was used as a proxy for median income. Most of these occupations were classified as high-wage, thus dispelling c", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-10-25T20:41:25.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-01-18T18:05:32.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-10-25T20:41:25.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-01-18T18:06:49.000Z", "columns_name": ["Jobs_Share", "OES_Jobs", "Year", "Wage_Category", "Source", "Subregion"], "columns_field_name": ["jobs_share", "oes_jobs", "year", "wage_category", "source", "subregion"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Share of jobs by wage category", "Number of jobs by wage category", "", "Wage categorization (low, middle, high)", "", ""], "columns_format": [{"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-01-18T18:06:50.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["economy", "demographics", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/yc3r-a4rh", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Jobs-by-Wage-Level-Subregion/yc3r-a4rh", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

In short, this measure reflects the integrity of regional bridges and overpasses. Structural deficiency is identified based on the condition of the structure as assessed by engineering professionals (as opposed to just the roadway surface).

{"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Jobs by Industry (Location Quotient) \u2013 Bay Area", "id": "ysen-ajs2", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nJobs by Industry (EC1)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nEmployment by place of work by industry sector\n\nLAST UPDATED\nJuly 2019\n\nDESCRIPTION\nJobs by industry refers to both the change in employment levels by industry and the proportional mix of jobs by economic sector. This measure reflects the changing industry trends that affect our region\u2019s workers.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nBureau of Labor Statistics: Current Employment Statistics\n1990-2017\nhttp://data.bls.gov\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nThe California Employment Development Department (EDD) provides estimates of employment by place of work and by industry. Industries are classified by their North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Vital Signs aggregates employment into 11 industry sectors: Farm, Mining, Logging and Construction, Manufacturing, Trade, Transportation and Utilities, Information, Financial Activities, Professional and Business Services, Educational and Health Services, Leisure and Hospitality, Government, and Other. EDD counts all public-sector jobs under Government, including public transportation, public schools, and public hospitals. The Other category includes service jobs such as auto repair and hair salons and organizations such as churches and social advocacy groups. Employment in the technology sector are classified under three categories: Professional and Business Services, Information, and Manufacturing. The latter category includes electronic and computer manufacturing. For further details of typical firms found in each sector, refer to the 2012 NAICS Manual (http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart=2012).\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides industry estimates for non-Bay Area metro areas. Their main industry employment estimates, the Current Employment Survey and Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, do not provide annual estimates of farm employment. To be consistent, the metro comparison evaluates nonfarm employment for all metro areas, including the Bay Area. Industry shares are thus slightly different for the Bay Area between the historical trend and metro comparison sections.\n\nThe location quotient (LQ) is used to evaluate level of concentration or clustering of an industry within the Bay Area and within each county of the region. A location quotient greater than 1 means there is a strong concentration for of jobs in an industry sector. For the Bay Area, the LQ is calculated as the share of the region\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the nation\u2019s employment in that same sector. Because BLS does not provide national farm estimates, note that there is no LQ for regional farm employment. For each county, the LQ is calculated as the share of the county\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the region\u2019s employment in that same sector.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-08-13T16:20:18.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-07-11T21:15:32.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-08-13T16:20:18.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-07-11T21:18:20.000Z", "columns_name": ["Industry", "Region", "Quadrant", "LQ", "Source", "Jobs", "Year", "PercntChng_1990"], "columns_field_name": ["industry", "region", "quadrant", "lq", "source", "jobs", "year", "percntchng_1990"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "Quadrant for visualization", "Location quotient", "", "", "", "Percent change in jobs since 1990"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {"precision": "4"}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-07-11T21:18:20.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["economy", "infrastructure", "demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/ysen-ajs2", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Jobs-by-Industry-Location-Quotient-Bay/ysen-ajs2", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}
