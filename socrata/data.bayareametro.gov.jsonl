Calculated using a three-year moving average, PCI ranges from zero (failed) to 100 (brand-new) and has been used as a regional indicator of pavement preservation for over a decade.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nMetropolitan Transportation Commission: StreetSaver\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nPavement condition index (PCI) relies upon a three-year moving average for regional, county and city PCI to improve the reliability of the PCI data on an annual basis. The index ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 representing a failed road and 100 representing a brand-new facility. Segment PCI data is collected on a rolling basis but is imputed for interim years based on facility age and treatments using the MTC StreetSaver system. Pavement condition data was not collected in 2008. As such, 2007 and 2009 PCI scores were averaged to compute a 2008 estimate for the region, county and city datasets. Due to a lack of reported PCI data for the city of Palo Alto in 2007, an average could not be calculated, so Palo Alto is not included in the Regional Distribution chart.", "attribution": "MTC StreetSaver", "attribution_link": "https://www.streetsaver.com/", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-10-15T03:16:14.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-10-15T03:09:32.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-10-15T03:16:14.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-10-15T03:12:49.000Z", "columns_name": ["Region", "3YRAvgChange", "Year", "3YRAverage", "Source"], "columns_field_name": ["region", "_3yravgchange", "year", "_3yraverage", "source"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "Change in average pavement condition index between 2014-2017 and 2015-2018", "", "Average pavement condition index 2015-2018", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-10-15T03:12:49.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["infrastructure", "transportation", "demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/vys4-7jxj", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Street-Pavement-Condition-Bay-Area-Upd/vys4-7jxj", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

A permitted unit is a unit that a city or county has authorized for construction.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nConstruction Industry Research Board\nTable 3: Residential Units and Valuation (1967-2010)\nNo link available\n\nCalifornia Housing Foundation/Construction Industry Research Board\nCalifornia Construction Trends (2011-2013)\nhttp://www.mychf.org/cirb/\n\nAssociation of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) \u2013 Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC)\nHousing Permits Database (2014-2017)\nhttp://opendata.mtc.ca.gov\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nBay Area housing permits data prior to 2014 comes from the California Housing Foundation/Construction Industry Research Board. Data from 2014 to 2017 comes from the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) \u2013 Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) Housing Permits Database.\n\nSingle-family housing units include detached, semi-detached, row house and town house units. Row houses and town houses are included as single-family units when each unit is separated from the adjacent unit by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Condominiums are included as single-family units when they are of zero-lot-line or zero-property-line construction; when units are separated by an air space; or, when units are separated by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Multi-family housing includes duplexes, three-to-four-unit structures and apartment-type structures with five units or more. Multi-family also includes condominium units in structures of more than one living unit that do not meet the single-family housing definition. In the permits data from 2014 to 2017, single-family units include all units not strictly classified as multi-family. This may include secondary units.\n\nEach multi-family unit is counted separately even though they may be in the same building. Total units is the sum of single-family and multi-family units. County data is available from 1967 whereas city data is available from 1990. City data is only available for incorporated cities and towns. All permits in unincorporated cities and towns are included under their respective county\u2019s unincorporated total. Permit data is not available for years when the city or town was not incorporated.\n\nAffordable housing is the total number of permitted units affordable to low and very low income households. Housing affordable to very low income households are households making below 50% of the area median income. Housing affordable to low income households are households making between 50% and 80% of the area median income. Housing affordable to moderate income households are households making below 80% and 120% of the area median income. Housing affordable to above moderate income households are households making above 120% of the area median income.\n\nPermit data is missing for the following cities and years:\nClayton, 1990-2007\nLafayette, 1990-2007\nMoraga, 1990-2007\nOrinda, 1990-2007\nSan Ramon, 1990\n\nBuilding permit data for metropolitan areas for each year is the sum of non-seasonally adjusted monthly estimates from the Building Permit Survey. The Bay Area values are the sum of the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward MSA and the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara MSA. The counties included in these areas are: San Francisco, Marin, Contra Costa, Alameda, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and San Benito.\n\nPermit values reflect the number of units permitted in each respective year.", "attribution": "ABAG Housing Permit Database", "attribution_link": "http://housing.abag.ca.gov/#permits", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-03-11T22:22:56.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-10-31T21:53:13.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-03-11T22:22:56.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-03-11T22:21:14.000Z", "columns_name": ["Moderate_Share", "VeryLowunits", "Affordableunits_Share", "MF_Share", "County", "VeryLow_Share", "Affordableunits", "AboveModerateunits", "Moderateunits", "Low_Share", "TOTALunits", "MFunits", "SFunits", "Year", "AboveModerate_Share", "SF_Share", "Lowunits", "Source"], "columns_field_name": ["moderate_share", "verylowunits", "affordableunits_share", "mf_share", "county", "verylow_share", "affordableunits", "abovemoderateunits", "moderateunits", "low_share", "totalunits", "mfunits", "sfunits", "year", "abovemoderate_share", "sf_share", "lowunits", "source"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Share of units for which permits were issued that are affordable at 80% to 120% Area Median Income", "Number of units for which permits were issued affordable at below 50% Area Median Income", "Share of units for which permits were issued that are affordable at below 80% Area Median Income", "Share of units for which permits were issued that are multi-family units", "", "Share of units for which permits were issued that are affordable at below 50% Area Median Income ", "Number of units for which permits were issued that are affordable at below 80% Area Median Income", "Number of units for which permits were issued affordable at over 120% Area Median Income", "Number of units for which permits were issued affordable at 80% to 120% Area Median Income", "Share of units for which permits were issued that are affordable at 50% to 80% Area Median Income", "Total number of units for which permits were issued", "Number of multi-family units for which permits were issued", "Number of single-family units for which permits were issued", "", "Share of units for which permits were issued that are affordable at over 120% Area Median Income", "Share of units for which permits were issued that are single-family units", "Number of units for which permits were issued affordable at 50% to 80% Area Median Income", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-11-14T19:46:21.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["environment", "infrastructure", "housing & development"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/wbvu-rmp6", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Housing-Permits-Bay-Area/wbvu-rmp6", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

While a significant share of residents may choose to rent, home prices represent a primary driver of housing affordability in a given region, county or city.\t\n\nDATA SOURCE\nZillow\nMedian Sale Price (1997-2018)\nhttp://www.zillow.com/research/data/\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics: Consumer Price Index\nAll Urban Consumers Data Table (1997-2018; specific to each metro area)\nhttp://data.bls.gov\n\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nMedian housing price estimates for the region, counties, cities, and zip code come from analysis of individual home sales by Zillow. The median sale price is the price separating the higher half of the sales from the lower half. In other words, 50 percent of home sales are below or above the median value. Zillow defines all homes as single-family residential, condominium, and co-operative homes with a county record. Single-family residences are detached, which means the home is an individual structure with its own lot. Condominiums are units that you own in a multi-unit complex, such as an apartment building. Co-operative homes are slightly different from condominiums where the homeowners own shares in the corporation that owns the building, not the actual units themselves. \n\nFor metropolitan area comparison values, the Bay Area metro area\u2019s median home sale price is the population-weighted average of the nine counties\u2019 median home prices. Home sales prices are not reliably available for Houston, because Texas is a non-disclosure state.

{"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Transit Ridership per Capita \u2013 by operator", "id": "wdpr-f2dr", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\r\nTransit Ridership (T12)\r\n\r\nFULL MEASURE NAME\r\nPer-capita annual transit boardings\r\n\r\nLAST UPDATED\r\nMay 2017\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\nTransit ridership refers to the number of passenger boardings on public transportation, which includes buses, rail systems and ferries. The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, mode and operator tables for per-capita annual boardings (for an average resident in the given region or service area).\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE\r\nFederal Transit Administration: National Transit Database\r\nhttp://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION\r\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\r\nParatransit data is sparse in early years of the NTD dataset, meaning that transit ridership estimates in the early 1990s are likely underestimated. Simple modes were aggregated to combine the various bus modes (e.g. rapid bus, express bus, local bus) into a single mode to avoid incorrect conclusions resulting from mode recoding over the lifespan of NTD. \r\n\r\n2016 data should be considered preliminary, as it is derived from the monthly data tables rather than the longer-term time-series dataset. The unlinked passenger trips recorded in NTD's Monthly Module Adjusted Data Release database is used to calculate 2016 year-over-year change in ridership. The calculated 2016 growth rate is applied to the 2015 annual unlinked passenger trips recorded in the TS2.1 - Service Dta and Operating Expenses Time-Series by Mode to estimate 2016 ridership numbers. 2016 ridership estimates were not made for small operators that did not report monthly ridership numbers. For the Bay Area, this means 2016 ridership estimates are unavailable for Union City Transit (UCT) and Vacaville City Coach. Due to the omission of some small operators from 2016 estimates, regional and metro ridership numbers are likely slightly underestimated. Weekday ridership is calculated by taking the total annual ridership and dividing by 300, an assumption which is consistent with MTC travel modeling procedures; it was also compared to observed weekday boarding data (which is more limited in availability) to ensure consistency on the regional level. Per-capita transit ridership is calculated for the operator's general service area or taxation district; for example, BART includes the three core counties (San Francisco, Alameda, and Contra Costa) as well as northern San Mateo County post-SFO extension and AC Transit includes the cities located within its service area. ACE per-capita transit ridership is calculated using the population of Alameda and San Joaquin counties. For other metro areas, operators were identified by developing a list of all urbanized areas within a current MSA boundary and then using that UZA list to flag relevant operators; this means that all operators (both large and small) were included in the metro comparison data.", "attribution": "Federal Transit Administration: National Transit Database", "attribution_link": "http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2018-07-06T18:04:39.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-05-24T20:49:41.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-07-06T18:04:39.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-06-05T22:26:27.000Z", "columns_name": ["PercentChg_1991", "System", "Source2", "PerCapita_Annual_Boardings", "System_Full_Name", "Source1", "Annual_Boardings", "Population", "Year"], "columns_field_name": ["percentchg_1991", "system", "source2", "percapita_annual_boardings", "system_full_name", "source1", "annual_boardings", "population", "year"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Percent change from 1991 ridership levels", "", "", "Annual transit boardings per-capita (per resident of service area)", "", "", "Annual passenger boardings", "", ""], "columns_format": [{"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "4", "align": "right"}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "1", "align": "right"}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "0", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "0", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-06-05T22:28:37.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["transportation", "health", "economy"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/wdpr-f2dr", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Transit-Ridership-per-Capita-by-operat/wdpr-f2dr", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

Some areas may also include additional subdivisions representing the 14- and 16-digit hydrologic unit (HU). At a minimum, the HUs are delineated at 1:24,000-scale in the conterminous United States, 1:25,000-scale in Hawaii, Pacific basin and the Caribbean, and 1:63,360-scale in Alaska, meeting the National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS). Higher resolution boundaries are being developed where partners and data exist and will be incorporated back into the WBD. WBD data are delivered as a dataset of polygons and corresponding lines that define the boundary of the polygon. WBD polygon attributes include hydrologic unit codes (HUC), size (in the form of acres and square kilometers), name, downstream hydrologic unit code, type of watershed, non-contributing areas, and flow modifications. The HUC describes where the unit is in the country and the level of the unit.

Regional and local geographies rely on data collected by real Answers, a research organization and database publisher specializing in the multifamily housing market. real Answers focuses on collecting longitudinal data for individual rental properties through quarterly surveys. For the Bay Area, their database is comprised of properties with 40 to 3,000+ housing units. Median list prices most likely have an upward bias due to the exclusion of smaller properties. The bias may be most extreme in geographies where large rental properties represent a small portion of the overall rental market. A map of the individual properties surveyed is included in the Local Focus section. \r\n\r\nIndividual properties surveyed provided lower- and upper-bound ranges for the various types of housing available (studio, 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, etc.). Median lower- and upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the regional and county geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the average of the median lower- and upper-bound prices for the region and counties. Median upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the city geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the median upper-bound price for cities. For simplicity, only the mean list rent is displayed for the individual properties. The metro areas geography rely upon Zillow data, which is the median price for rentals listed through www.zillow.com during the month. Like the real Answers data, Zillow's median list prices most likely have an upward bias since small properties are underrepresented in Zillow's listings. The metro area data for the Bay Area cannot be compared to the regional Bay Area data. Due to afore mentioned data limitations, this data is suitable for analyzing the change in list rents over time but not necessarily comparisons of absolute list rents.

Congestion is defined as speeds less than 35 mph, the level at which freeway throughput is maximized. The dataset includes regional and county tables for congested share of freeway miles driven.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nMTC/Caltrans: Performance Monitoring System (PeMS) Congested Mileage Analysis\n2004-2016\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nCongested VMT data only includes freeway facilities and relies upon PeMS traffic data. They reflect delay on a typical weekday, which is defined as Tuesday through Thursday during peak traffic months. Delay statistics emphasize recurring delay - i.e. consistent delay greater than 15 minutes on a specific freeway segment. Congested delay is defined as congestion occurring with speeds less than 35 mph and is commonly recognized as inefficient delay (meaning that the freeway corridor is operating at speeds low enough to reduce throughput - as opposed to speeds greater than 35 mph which increase throughput).", "attribution": "MTC", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2018-07-10T01:39:25.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-05-11T20:46:23.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-07-10T01:39:25.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-05-11T20:46:29.000Z", "columns_name": ["Source", "Congest_Share", "Region", "Year"], "columns_field_name": ["source", "congest_share", "region", "year"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "Share of freeway miles traveled in congestion [to convert to %, multiply by 100]", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "3", "align": "right"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-05-11T20:50:29.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/wftq-cs7m", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Miles-Traveled-in-Congestion-Bay-Area/wftq-cs7m", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

A Priority Development Area (PDA) is a locally-designated area with frequent transit service, where a jurisdiction has decided to concentrate most of its housing and jobs growth for development in the foreseeable future. PDA boundaries are current as of August 2019. For more information on PDA designation see http://gis.abag.ca.gov/website/PDAShowcase/.\n\nPopulation estimates for Bay Area counties and cities are from the California Department of Finance, which are as of January 1st of each year. Population estimates for non-Bay Area regions are from the U.S. Census Bureau. Decennial Census years reflect population as of April 1st of each year whereas population estimates for intercensal estimates are as of July 1st of each year. Population estimates for Bay Area tracts are from the decennial Census (1970 -2010) and the American Community Survey (2008-2012 5-year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average; 2013-2017 5-year rolling average). Estimates of population density for tracts use gross acres as the denominator.\n\nPopulation estimates for Bay Area PDAs are from the decennial Census (1970 - 2010) and the American Community Survey (2006-2010 5 year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average; 2013-2017 5-year rolling average). Population estimates for PDAs are derived from Census population counts at the tract level for 1970-1990 and at the block group level for 2000-2017. Population from either tracts or block groups are allocated to a PDA using an area ratio. For example, if a quarter of a Census block group lies with in a PDA, a quarter of its population will be allocated to that PDA. Tract-to-PDA and block group-to-PDA area ratios are calculated using gross acres. Estimates of population density for PDAs use gross acres as the denominator.\n\n\nAnnual population estimates for metropolitan areas outside the Bay Area are from the Census and are benchmarked to each decennial Census. The annual estimates in the 1990s were not updated to match the 2000 benchmark.\n\nThe following is a", "attribution": "U.S. Census Bureau", "attribution_link": "https://www.factfinder.census.gov", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2020-04-13T23:12:26.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-10-16T19:11:19.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-04-13T23:12:26.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2020-03-24T21:50:19.000Z", "columns_name": ["PercentChng_1970", "Year", "PDA_ID", "Population", "Acres", "Source1", "PopDensity", "PDA"], "columns_field_name": ["percentchng_1970", "year", "pdaid", "population", "acres", "source1", "popdensity", "pda"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Percent change in population since 1970", "", "Priority Development Area ID", "Population", "Area in acres", "", "Population density in residents per acre", "Priority Development Area name"], "columns_format": [{}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {"precision": "0"}, {}, {}, {"precision": "2"}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-03-24T21:50:20.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "environment"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/whse-7rx6", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Population-by-PDA/whse-7rx6", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

Note that rent can be presented using nominal or real (inflation-adjusted) dollar values; data are presented inflation-adjusted to reflect changes in household purchasing power over time.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census - https://nhgis.org  \nCount 2 (1970)  \nForm STF1 (1980-1990)  \nForm SF3a (2000)\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey - https://data.census.gov/  \nForm B25058 (2005-2021; median contract rent)\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics: Consumer Price Index - https://www.bls.gov/data/  \n1970-2021\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nRent data reflects median rent payments rather than list rents (refer to measure definition above). American Community Survey 1-year data is used for larger geographies \u2013 Bay counties and most metropolitan area counties \u2013 while smaller geographies rely upon 5-year rolling average data due to their smaller sample sizes. Note that 2020 data uses the 5-year estimates because the ACS did not collect 1-year data for 2020.\n\n1970 Census data for median rent payments has been imputed from quintiles using methodology from California Department of Finance as the source data only provided the mean, rather than the median, monthly rent. Metro area boundaries reflects today\u2019s metro area definitions by county for consistency, rather than historical metro area boundaries.\n\nInflation-adjusted data are presented to illustrate how rent payments have grown relative to overall price increases; that said, the use of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) does create some challenges given the fact that housing represents a major chunk of consumer goods bundle used to calculate CPI. This reflects a methodological tradeoff between precision and accuracy and is a common concern when working with any commodity that is a major component of CPI itself.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-20T17:48:33.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-06-14T17:39:24.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-20T17:48:33.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-01T00:38:41.000Z", "columns_name": ["Source", "Median_Contract_Rent_PercentChg_1970", "Median_Contract_Rent_IA", "Median_Contract_Rent", "Year", "County", "City", "Median_Contract_Rent_IA_PercentChg_1970"], "columns_field_name": ["source", "median_contract_rent_perchg1970", "median_contract_rent_ia", "median_contract_rent", "year", "county", "city", "median_contract_rent_ia_perchg1970"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-06-14T17:39:26.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/wjgr-k4g6", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Rent-Payments-by-city-2022-/wjgr-k4g6", "owner": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}, "creator": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}}

A permitted unit is a unit that a city or county has authorized for construction.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nCalifornia Housing Foundation/Construction Industry Research Board (CIRB) - https://www.cirbreport.org/  \nConstruction Review report (1967-2022)\n\nAssociation of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) \u2013 Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) - https://data.bayareametro.gov/Development/HCD-Annual-Progress-Report-Jurisdiction-Summary/nxbj-gfv7  \nHousing Permits Database (2014-2021)\n\nCensus Bureau Building Permit Survey - https://www2.census.gov/econ/bps/County/  \nBuilding permits by county (annual, monthly)\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nBay Area housing permits data by single/multi family come from the California Housing Foundation/Construction Industry Research Board (CIRB). Affordability breakdowns from 2014 to 2021 come from the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) \u2013 Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) Housing Permits Database.\n\nSingle-family housing units include detached, semi-detached, row house and town house units. Row houses and town houses are included as single-family units when each unit is separated from the adjacent unit by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Condominiums are included as single-family units when they are of zero-lot-line or zero-property-line construction; when units are separated by an air space; or, when units are separated by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Multi-family housing includes duplexes, three-to-four-unit structures and apartment-type structures with five units or more. Multi-family also includes condominium units in structures of more than one living unit that do not meet the single-family housing definition.\n\nEach multi-family unit is counted separately even though they may be in the same building. Total units is the sum of single-family and multi-family units. County data is available from 1967 whereas city data is available from 1990. City data is only available for incorporated cities and towns. All permits in unincorporated cities and towns are included under their respective county\u2019s unincorporated total. Permit data is not available for years when the city or town was not incorporated.\n\nAffordable housing is the total number of permitted units affordable to low and very low income households. Housing affordable to very low income households are households making below 50% of the area median income. Housing affordable to low income households are households making between 50% and 80% of the area median income. Housing affordable to moderate income households are households making below 80% and 120% of the area median income. Housing affordable to above moderate income households are households making above 120% of the area median income.\n\nPermit data is missing for the following cities and years:  \nClayton, 1990-2007  \nLafayette, 1990-2007  \nMoraga, 1990-2007  \nOrinda, 1990-2007  \nSan Ramon, 1990\n\nBuilding permit data for metropolitan areas for each year is the sum of non-seasonally adjusted monthly estimates from the Census Building Permit Survey. The Bay Area values are the sum of the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward MSA and the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara MSA. The counties included in these areas are: San Francisco, Marin, Contra Costa, Alameda, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and San Benito.\n\nPermit values reflect the number of units permitted in each respective year.

City data was thus discarded due to this limitation and the analysis only examine county and regional data, where through-trips are generally less common.\r\n\r\nThe metropolitan area comparison was performed by summing all of the urbanized areas within each metropolitan area (9-nine region for the San Francisco Bay Area and the primary MSA for all others).

While \u201cat risk\u201d households may not necessarily be displaced in the short-term or long-term, neighborhoods identified as being \u201cat risk\u201d signify pressure as reflected by the decline in lower-income households (who are presumed to relocate to other more affordable communities).

Historical data is pulled from U.S. Census datasets and aligned with today\u2019s census tract boundaries using crosswalk tables provided by LTDB. Tract data, as well as regional income data, are calculated using 5-year rolling averages for consistency \u2013 given that tract data is only available on a 5-year basis. Using household tables by income level, the number of households in each tract falling below the median are summed, which involves summing all brackets below the regional median and then summing a fractional share of the bracket that includes the regional median (assuming a simple linear distribution within that bracket).\n\nOnce all tracts in a given county or metro area are synced to today\u2019s boundaries, the analysis identifies census tracts of greater than 500 lower-income people (in the prior year) to filter out low-population areas. For those tracts, any net loss between the prior year and the analysis year results in that tract being flagged as being at risk of displacement, and all lower-income households in that tract are flagged. To calculate the share of households at risk, the number of lower-income households living in flagged tracts are summed and divided by the total number of lower-income households living in the larger geography (county or metro). Minor deviations on a year-to-year basis should be taken in context, given that data on the tract level often fluctuates and has a significant margin of error; changes on the county and regional level are more appropriate to consider on an annual basis instead.", "attribution": "U.S. Census Bureau", "attribution_link": "http://api.census.gov", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-08-13T16:05:02.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-12-12T22:47:20.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-08-13T16:05:02.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2018-12-12T22:50:32.000Z", "columns_name": ["Metro", "Source1", "Displacement_Risk", "Source3", "LIHH_At_Risk", "LIHH_Total", "Source2", "Year"], "columns_field_name": ["metro", "source1", "displacement_risk", "source3", "lihh_at_risk", "lihh_total", "source2", "year"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "Share of lower-income households at risk of displacement", "", "Number of lower-income households at risk of displacement", "Total number of lower-income households", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-12-12T22:50:33.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "infrastructure", "environment"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/wx2e-8w6i", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Displacement-Risk-by-metro/wx2e-8w6i", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

Covered employees in the private-sector and in the state and local government include most corporate officials, all executives, all supervisory personnel, all professionals, all clerical workers, many farmworkers, all wage earners, all piece workers and all part-time workers. Workers on paid sick leave, paid holiday, paid vacation and the like are also covered.\n\nBesides excluding the aforementioned national security agencies, QCEW excludes proprietors, the unincorporated self-employed, unpaid family members, certain farm and domestic workers exempted from having to report employment data and railroad workers covered by the railroad unemployment insurance system. Excluded as well are workers who earned no wages during the entire applicable pay period because of work stoppages, temporary layoffs, illness or unpaid vacations. \n\nFor measuring jobs below the county level, Vital Signs assigns collections of incorporated cities and towns to sub-county areas. For example, the cities of East Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Portola Valley, Redwood City and Woodside are considered South San Mateo County. Because Bay Area counties differ in footprint, the number of cities included in a sub-county is one for San Francisco and San Jose and more than one for all other sub-counties.

CPAD is not a database of all public lands \u2013 for example, it does not include public buildings, water treatment sites, or other non-open space public land.\n\nCPAD is suitable for a wide range of planning, assessment, analysis, and display purposes. CPAD should not be used as the basis for official regulatory, legal, or other such governmental actions without more detailed review of current official land records in the area of focus.\n\nThis feature set contains the CPAD Super Unit features of the database. Super Units are aggregations of Units (which themselves are aggregations of Holdings) to create use-focused polygons for each site name (e.g. Las Trampas Regional Wilderness).\n\nSuper Units are useful for recreation applications and for cartographic representation.\n\nNote:\n \u25cf Super Units aggregate units based on the managing agency.\n \u25cf Super Units maintain distinct units for different types of public access.\n \u25cf Super Units cross county boundaries.\n \u25cf Super Units have fewer attributes and are primarily used for cartography/display purposes, and to support recreational access applications.\n\nThe lands in CPAD are defined by their owning and managing agencies at the Holdings and Units levels. At the Super Units level (a version of the release meant primarily for recreation applications, and for general cartography), CPAD lands are defined simply by name, managing agency, and public access.\n\nAccess to CPAD GIS data is primarily through the State of California\u2019s Atlas open data portal \u2013 a download link and more information about CPAD, including a PDF manual about the data, is at https://www.calands.org/cpad/.

To allow for historical comparisons, the Census Bureau merges housing expenditure brackets into three consistent bins (less than 20 percent, 20 percent to 34 percent, and more than 35 percent) that work for all years. The highest income bracket for renters in the ACS data was $100,000 or more, while the homeowner dataset included brackets for $100,000 to $149,999 and $150,000 and above. These brackets were merged together to allow for uniform comparison across tenure. While some studies use 30 percent as the affordability threshold, Vital Signs uses 35 percent as this is the closest break point using the standardized affordability brackets above. Historical data for Napa County is unavailable due to an insufficient sample size for renters in a number of years, making it impossible to calculate affordability for all households. All ACS data is for a single year, rather than a rolling average.

The footprint is defined as land occupied by structures, with a building density of at least 1 unit to 1.5 acres.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nDepartment of Conservation: Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program\nGIS Data Tables/Layers (1990-2016)\nhttps://www.conservation.ca.gov/dlrp/fmmp\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census\nPopulation by Census Block Group (2000-2010)\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey (5-year)\nPopulation by Census Block Group (2000-2017)\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nFor regional and local data, FMMP maps the extent of \u201curban and built-up\u201d lands, which generally reflect the developed urban footprint of the region. The footprint is defined as land occupied by structures with building density of at least 1 unit to 1.5 acres. Uses include residential, industrial, commercial, construction, institutional, public administration, railroad and other transportation yards, cemeteries, airports, golf courses, sanitary landfills, sewage treatment, water control structures, and other developed purposes.\n\nTo determine the amount of greenfield development (in acres) occurring in a given two-year period, the differences in urban footprint are computed on a county-level. FMMP makes slight refinements to urban boundaries over time, so changes in urban footprint +/- 100 acres are not regionally significant. The GIS shapefile represents the 2016 urban footprint and thus does not show previously urbanized land outside of the footprint (i.e. Hamilton Air Force Base).\n\nFor metro comparisons, a different methodology had to be used to avoid the geospatial limitations associated with FMMP. U.S. Census population by census block group was gathered for each metro area for 2000, 2010, and 2017. Population data for years 2000 and 2010 come from the Decennial Census while data for 2018 comes from the 2017 5-year American Community Survey. The block group was considered urbanized if its average/gross density was greater than 1 housing unit per acre (a slightly higher threshold than FMMP uses for its definition). Because a block group cannot be flagged as partially urbanized, and non-residential uses are not fully captured, the urban footprint of the region calculated with this methodology is smaller than in FMMP. The metro data should be primarily used for looking at comparative growth rate in greenfield development rather than the acreage totals themselves.", "attribution": "Farmland Mapping & Monitoring Program", "attribution_link": "https://www.conservation.ca.gov/dlrp/fmmp", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2020-07-03T16:36:18.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-11-14T20:48:13.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-07-03T16:36:18.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-11-15T22:36:27.000Z", "columns_name": ["Share_of_Region_Change_2010", "Year", "Share_of_Region_Change_2000", "Change_Urban_Acres_2010", "Change_Urban_Acres_2000", "Change_Urban_Acres_1990", "Urban_Acres", "County", "Share_of_Region_Change_1990", "Source"], "columns_field_name": ["share_of_region_change_2010", "year", "share_of_region_change_2000", "change_urban_acres_2010", "change_urban_acres_2000", "change_urban_acres_1990", "urban_acres", "county", "share_of_region_change_1990", "source"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Share of regional change in urbanized acres since 2010", "", "Share of regional change in urbanized acres since 2000", "Percent change in urbanized acres since 2010", "Percent change in urbanized acres since 2000", "Percent change in urbanized acres since 1990", "Number of urbanized acres", "", "Share of regional change in urbanized acres since 1990", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-11-14T20:50:21.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["environment", "demographics", "infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/x8pj-558q", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Greenfield-Development-by-county/x8pj-558q", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

For the decennial Census datasets, the breakdown of auto commuters between drive alone and carpool is not available before 1980. American Community Survey 1-year data is used for larger geographies \u2013 Bay counties and most metropolitan area counties \u2013 while smaller geographies rely upon 5-year rolling average data due to their smaller sample sizes. This will result in discrepancies in cases like San Francisco where it is both a city and a county. Note that 2020 data uses the 5-year estimates because the ACS did not collect 1-year data for 2020. Additionally, for the County by place of residence breakdown, Napa was missing ACS 1-Year commute mode choice data for all modes for 2007, 2008, 2011 and 2021. 5-Year estimates were used to fill the missing data for 2011 and 2021, but not 2007 or 2008 since the 5-Year estimates start in 2009.\n\nRegional mode shares are population-weighted averages of the nine counties' modal shares. \"Auto\" includes drive alone and carpool for the simple data tables and is broken out in the detailed data tables accordingly, as it was not available before 1980. \"Transit\" includes public operators (Muni, BART, etc.) and employer-provided shuttles (e.g., Google shuttle buses). \"Other\" includes motorcycle, taxi, and other modes of transportation; bicycle mode share was broken out separately for the first time in the 2006 data and is shown in the detailed data tables. Census tract data is not available for tracts with insufficient numbers of residents or workers.\n\nThe metropolitan area comparison was performed for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area in addition to the primary metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) for other major metropolitan areas.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-20T17:13:58.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-07-08T00:23:55.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-20T17:13:58.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-09-23T22:04:26.000Z", "columns_name": ["County", "Data_Type", "Source", "Year", "Mode", "Share"], "columns_field_name": ["county", "data_type", "source", "year", "mode", "share"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-07-08T00:23:57.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/xcep-e2qd", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Commute-Mode-Choice-by-Place-of-Employ/xcep-e2qd", "owner": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}, "creator": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}}

To allow for historical comparisons, the Census Bureau merges housing expenditure brackets into three consistent bins (less than 20 percent, 20 percent to 34 percent, and more than 35 percent) that work for all years. The highest income bracket for renters in the ACS data was $100,000 or more, while the homeowner dataset included brackets for $100,000 to $149,999 and $150,000 and above. These brackets were merged together to allow for uniform comparison across tenure. While some studies use 30 percent as the affordability threshold, Vital Signs uses 35 percent as this is the closest break point using the standardized affordability brackets above. Historical data for Napa County is unavailable due to an insufficient sample size for renters in a number of years, making it impossible to calculate affordability for all households. All ACS data is for a single year, rather than a rolling average.

The national poverty level does not vary geographically even though cost of living is different across the United States. For the Bay Area, where cost of living is high and incomes are correspondingly high, an appropriate poverty level is 200% of poverty or twice the national poverty level, consistent with what was used for past equity work at MTC and ABAG. For comparison, however, both the national and 200% poverty levels are presented. \n\nFor Vital Signs, the poverty rate is defined as the number of people (including children) living below twice the poverty level divided by the number of people for whom poverty status is determined. The household income definitions for poverty change each year to reflect inflation. The official poverty definition uses money income before taxes and does not include capital gains or non-cash benefits (such as public housing, Medicaid and food stamps). \n\nFor the national poverty level definitions by year, see: US Census Bureau Poverty Thresholds - https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html.\n\nFor an explanation on how the Census Bureau measures poverty, see: How the Census Bureau Measures Poverty - https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/poverty/guidance/poverty-measures.html.\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS) 1-year data is used for larger geographies \u2013 Bay counties and most metropolitan area counties \u2013 while smaller geographies rely upon 5-year rolling average data due to their smaller sample sizes.

Calculated using a three-year moving average, PCI ranges from zero (failed) to 100 (brand-new) and has been used as a regional indicator of pavement preservation for over a decade.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nMetropolitan Transportation Commission: StreetSaver\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nPavement condition index (PCI) relies upon a three-year moving average for regional, county and city PCI to improve the reliability of the PCI data on an annual basis. The index ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 representing a failed road and 100 representing a brand-new facility.

Affordability breakdowns from 2014 to 2021 come from the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) \u2013 Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) Housing Permits Database.\n\nSingle-family housing units include detached, semi-detached, row house and town house units. Row houses and town houses are included as single-family units when each unit is separated from the adjacent unit by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Condominiums are included as single-family units when they are of zero-lot-line or zero-property-line construction; when units are separated by an air space; or, when units are separated by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Multi-family housing includes duplexes, three-to-four-unit structures and apartment-type structures with five units or more. Multi-family also includes condominium units in structures of more than one living unit that do not meet the single-family housing definition.\n\nEach multi-family unit is counted separately even though they may be in the same building. Total units is the sum of single-family and multi-family units. County data is available from 1967 whereas city data is available from 1990. City data is only available for incorporated cities and towns. All permits in unincorporated cities and towns are included under their respective county\u2019s unincorporated total. Permit data is not available for years when the city or town was not incorporated.\n\nAffordable housing is the total number of permitted units affordable to low and very low income households. Housing affordable to very low income households are households making below 50% of the area median income. Housing affordable to low income households are households making between 50% and 80% of the area median income. Housing affordable to moderate income households are households making below 80% and 120% of the area median income. Housing affordable to above moderate income households are households making above 120% of the area median income.\n\nPermit data is missing for the following cities and years:  \nClayton, 1990-2007  \nLafayette, 1990-2007  \nMoraga, 1990-2007  \nOrinda, 1990-2007  \nSan Ramon, 1990\n\nBuilding permit data for metropolitan areas for each year is the sum of non-seasonally adjusted monthly estimates from the Census Building Permit Survey.

The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional and county tables for total vehicle miles traveled.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nCalifornia Department of Transportation: California Public Road Data/Highway Performance Monitoring System - http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/tsip/hpms/datalibrary.php  \n2001-2020\n\nFederal Highway Administration: Highway Statistics - https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2020/hm71.cfm  \n2020\n\nCalifornia Department of Finance: E-4 Historical Population Estimates for Cities, Counties, and the State - https://dof.ca.gov/forecasting/demographics/estimates/  \n2001-2020\n\nUS Census Population and Housing Unit Estimates - https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest.html  \n2020\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nVehicle miles traveled (VMT) reflects the mileage accrued within the county and not necessarily the residents of that county; even though most trips are due to local residents, additional VMT can be accrued by through-trips. City data was thus discarded due to this limitation and the analysis only examines county and regional data, where through-trips are generally less common.\n\nThe metropolitan area comparison was performed by summing all of the urbanized areas for which the majority of its population falls within a given metropolitan area (9-county region for the San Francisco Bay Area and the primary metropolitan statistical area (MSA) for all others). For the metro analysis, no VMT data is available in rural areas; it is only available for intraregional analysis purposes.

Life expectancy does not reflect how long any given individual is expected to live; rather, it is an artificial measure that captures an aspect of the mortality rates across a population that can be compared across time and populations. More information about the determinants of life expectancy that may lead to differences in life expectancy between neighborhoods can be found in the Bay Area Regional Health Inequities Initiative (BARHII) Health Inequities in the Bay Area report at http://www.barhii.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/barhii_hiba.pdf.  Vital Signs measures life expectancy at birth (as opposed to cohort life expectancy). A statistical model was used to estimate life expectancy for Bay Area counties and ZIP Codes based on current life tables which require both age and mortality data. A life table is a table which shows, for each age, the survivorship of a people from a certain population.\r\n\r\nCurrent life tables were created using death records and population estimates by age. The California Department of Public Health provided death records based on the California death certificate information. Records include age at death and residential ZIP Code. Single-year age population estimates at the regional- and county-level comes from the California Department of Finance population estimates and projections for ages 0-100+. Population estimates for ages 100 and over are aggregated to a single age interval. Using this data, death rates in a population within age groups for a given year are computed to form unabridged life tables (as opposed to abridged life tables). To calculate life expectancy, the probability of dying between the jth and (j+1)st birthday is assumed uniform after age 1. Special consideration is taken to account for infant mortality.\r\n\r\nFor the ZIP Code-level life expectancy calculation, it is assumed that postal ZIP Codes share the same boundaries as ZIP Code Census Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs). More information on the relationship between ZIP Codes and ZCTAs can be found at http://www.census.gov/geo/reference/zctas.html. ZIP Code-level data uses three years of mortality data to make robust estimates due to small sample size. Year 2013 ZIP Code life expectancy estimates reflects death records from 2011 through 2013. 2013 is the last year with available mortality data. Death records for ZIP Codes with zero population (like those associated with P.O. Boxes) were assigned to the nearest ZIP Code with population. ZIP Code population for 2000 estimates comes from the Decennial Census. ZIP Code population for 2013 estimates are from the American Community Survey (5-Year Average). ACS estimates are adjusted using Decennial Census data for more accurate population estimates. An adjustment factor was calculated using the ratio between the 2010 Decennial Census population estimates and the 2012 ACS 5-Year (with middle year 2010) population estimates.

Regional and local geographies rely on data collected by real Answers, a research organization and database publisher specializing in the multifamily housing market. real Answers focuses on collecting longitudinal data for individual rental properties through quarterly surveys. For the Bay Area, their database is comprised of properties with 40 to 3,000+ housing units. Median list prices most likely have an upward bias due to the exclusion of smaller properties. The bias may be most extreme in geographies where large rental properties represent a small portion of the overall rental market. A map of the individual properties surveyed is included in the Local Focus section. \r\n\r\nIndividual properties surveyed provided lower- and upper-bound ranges for the various types of housing available (studio, 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, etc.). Median lower- and upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the regional and county geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the average of the median lower- and upper-bound prices for the region and counties. Median upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the city geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the median upper-bound price for cities. For simplicity, only the mean list rent is displayed for the individual properties. The metro areas geography rely upon Zillow data, which is the median price for rentals listed through www.zillow.com during the month. Like the real Answers data, Zillow's median list prices most likely have an upward bias since small properties are underrepresented in Zillow's listings. The metro area data for the Bay Area cannot be compared to the regional Bay Area data. Due to afore mentioned data limitations, this data is suitable for analyzing the change in list rents over time but not necessarily comparisons of absolute list rents. Metro area boundaries reflects today\u2019s metro area definitions by county for consistency, rather than historical metro area boundaries.\r\n\r\nDue to the limited number of rental properties surveyed, city-level data is unavailable for Atherton, Belvedere, Brisbane, Calistoga, Clayton, Cloverdale, Cotati, Fairfax, Half Moon Bay, Healdsburg, Hillsborough, Los Altos Hills, Monte Sereno, Moranga, Oakley, Orinda, Portola Valley, Rio Vista, Ross, San Anselmo, San Carlos, Saratoga, Sebastopol, Windsor, Woodside, and Yountville.\r\n\r\nInflation-adjusted data are presented to illustrate how rents have grown relative to overall price increases; that said, the use of the Consumer Price Index does create some challenges given the fact that housing represents a major chunk of consumer goods bundle used to calculate CPI. This reflects a methodological tradeoff between precision and accuracy and is a common concern when working with any commodity that is a major component of CPI itself.

This measure reflects the changing industry trends that affect our region\u2019s workers.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nBureau of Labor Statistics, Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) - https://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm  \n1990-2021  \n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nQuarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) employment data is reported by the place of work and represent the number of covered workers who worked during, or received pay for, the pay period that included the 12th day of the month. Covered employees in the private-sector and in the state and local government include most corporate officials, all executives, all supervisory personnel, all professionals, all clerical workers, many farmworkers, all wage earners, all piece workers and all part-time workers. Workers on paid sick leave, paid holiday, paid vacation and the like are also covered.\n\nBesides excluding the aforementioned national security agencies, QCEW excludes proprietors, the unincorporated self-employed, unpaid family members, certain farm and domestic workers exempted from having to report employment data and railroad workers covered by the railroad unemployment insurance system. Excluded as well are workers who earned no wages during the entire applicable pay period because of work stoppages, temporary layoffs, illness or unpaid vacations. \n\nThe location quotient (LQ) is used to evaluate level of concentration or clustering of an industry within the Bay Area and within each county of the region. A location quotient greater than 1 means there is a strong concentration for of jobs in an industry sector. For the Bay Area, the LQ is calculated as the share of the region\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of California's employment in that same sector. For each county, the LQ is calculated as the share of the county\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the region\u2019s employment in that same sector.\n\nData is mainly pulled from aggregation level 73, which is county-level summarized at the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) supersector level (12 sectors). This aggregation level exhibits the least loss due to data suppression, in the magnitude of 1-2 percent for regional employment, and is therefore preferred. However, the supersectors group together NAICS 11 Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting; NAICS 21 Mining and NAICS 23 Construction. To provide a separate tally of Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting, the aggregation level 74 data was used for NAICS codes 11, 21 and 23. \n\nQCEW reports on employment in Public Administration as NAICS 92. However, many government activities are reported with an industry specific code - such as transportation or utilities even if those may be public governmental entities. In 2021 for the Bay Area, the largest industry groupings under public ownership are Education and health services (58%); Public administration (29%) and Trade, transportation, and utilities (29%). With the exception of Education and health services, all other public activities were coded as government/public administration, regardless of industry group.\n\nFor the county data there were some industries that reported 0 jobs or did not report jobs at the desired aggregation/NAICS level for the following counties/years:\n\nFarm:  \n(aggregation level: 74, NAICS code: 11)\n- Contra Costa: 2008-2010\n- Marin: 1990-2006, 2008-2010, 2014-2020\n- Napa: 1990-2004, 2013-2021\n- San Francisco: 2019-2020\n- San Mateo: 2013\n\nInformation:  \n(aggregation level: 73, NAICS code: 51)\n- Solano: 2001\n\nFinancial Activities:  \n(aggregatio", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-13T17:54:05.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-06-10T00:59:23.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-13T17:54:05.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-07-06T20:51:17.000Z", "columns_name": ["Difference_1990", "Geo_Name", "Source", "industry_name", "Objectid", "Year", "Percentchange_1990", "Industry"], "columns_field_name": ["difference_1990", "geo_name", "source", "industry_name", "objectid", "year", "percentchange_1990", "industry"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["difference_1990", "geo_name", "Source", "", "objectid", "Year", "percentchange_1990", "Industry"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-07-06T20:30:43.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Economy", "domain_tags": ["ec1", "vital signs", "vital signs 2.0"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/y9r8-pr4c", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/Economy/Vital-Signs-Change-in-Jobs-by-Industry-Bay-Area-20/y9r8-pr4c", "owner": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}, "creator": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}}

{"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Jobs by Wage Level - Subregion", "id": "yc3r-a4rh", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nJobs by Wage Level (EQ1)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nDistribution of jobs by low-, middle-, and high-wage occupations\n\nLAST UPDATED\nJanuary 2019\n\nDESCRIPTION\nJobs by wage level refers to the distribution of jobs by low-, middle- and high-wage occupations. In the San Francisco Bay Area, low-wage occupations have a median hourly wage of less than 80% of the regional median wage; median wages for middle-wage occupations range from 80% to 120% of the regional median wage, and high-wage occupations have a median hourly wage above 120% of the regional median wage.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nCalifornia Employment Development Department OES\n(2001-2017)\nhttp://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov/data/oes-employment-and-wages.html\n\nAmerican Community Survey\n(2001-2017)\nhttp://api.census.gov\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nJobs are determined to be low-, middle-, or high-wage based on the median hourly wage of their occupational classification in the most recent year. Low-wage jobs are those that pay below 80% of the regional median wage. Middle-wage jobs are those that pay between 80% and 120% of the regional median wage. High-wage jobs are those that pay above 120% of the regional median wage. Regional median hourly wages are estimated from the American Community Survey and are published on the Vital Signs Income indicator page. For the national context analysis, occupation wage classifications are unique to each metro area. A low-wage job in New York, for instance, may be a middle-wage job in Miami. For the Bay Area in 2017, the median hourly wage for low-wage occupations was less than $20.86 per hour. For middle-wage jobs, the median ranged from $20.86 to $31.30 per hour; and for high-wage jobs, the median wage was above $31.30 per hour.\n\nOccupational employment and wage information comes from the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) program. Regional and subregional data is published by the California Employment Development Department. Metro data is published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The OES program collects data on wage and salary workers in nonfarm establishments to produce employment and wage estimates for some 800 occupations. Data from non-incorporated self-employed persons are not collected, and are not included in these estimates. Wage estimates represent a three-year rolling average.\n\nDue to changes in reporting during the analysis period, subregion data from the EDD OES have been aggregated to produce geographies that can be compared over time. West Bay is San Mateo, San Francisco, and Marin counties. North Bay is Sonoma, Solano and Napa counties. East Bay is Alameda and Contra Costa counties. South Bay is Santa Clara County from 2001-2004 and Santa Clara and San Benito counties from 2005-2017.\n\nDue to changes in occupation classifications during the analysis period, all occupations have been reassigned to 2010 SOC codes. For pre-2009 reporting years, all employment in occupations that were split into two or more 2010 SOC occupations are assigned to the first 2010 SOC occupation listed in the crosswalk table provided by the Census Bureau. This method assumes these occupations always fall in the same wage category, and sensitivity analysis of this reassignment method shows this is true in most cases.\n\nIn order to use OES data for time series analysis, several steps were taken to handle missing wage or employment data. For some occupations, such as airline pilots and flight attendants, no wage information was provided and these were removed from the analysis.

{"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Jobs by Industry (Location Quotient) \u2013 Bay Area", "id": "ysen-ajs2", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nJobs by Industry (EC1)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nEmployment by place of work by industry sector\n\nLAST UPDATED\nJuly 2019\n\nDESCRIPTION\nJobs by industry refers to both the change in employment levels by industry and the proportional mix of jobs by economic sector. This measure reflects the changing industry trends that affect our region\u2019s workers.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nBureau of Labor Statistics: Current Employment Statistics\n1990-2017\nhttp://data.bls.gov\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nThe California Employment Development Department (EDD) provides estimates of employment by place of work and by industry. Industries are classified by their North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Vital Signs aggregates employment into 11 industry sectors: Farm, Mining, Logging and Construction, Manufacturing, Trade, Transportation and Utilities, Information, Financial Activities, Professional and Business Services, Educational and Health Services, Leisure and Hospitality, Government, and Other. EDD counts all public-sector jobs under Government, including public transportation, public schools, and public hospitals. The Other category includes service jobs such as auto repair and hair salons and organizations such as churches and social advocacy groups. Employment in the technology sector are classified under three categories: Professional and Business Services, Information, and Manufacturing. The latter category includes electronic and computer manufacturing. For further details of typical firms found in each sector, refer to the 2012 NAICS Manual (http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart=2012).\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides industry estimates for non-Bay Area metro areas. Their main industry employment estimates, the Current Employment Survey and Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, do not provide annual estimates of farm employment. To be consistent, the metro comparison evaluates nonfarm employment for all metro areas, including the Bay Area. Industry shares are thus slightly different for the Bay Area between the historical trend and metro comparison sections.\n\nThe location quotient (LQ) is used to evaluate level of concentration or clustering of an industry within the Bay Area and within each county of the region. A location quotient greater than 1 means there is a strong concentration for of jobs in an industry sector. For the Bay Area, the LQ is calculated as the share of the region\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the nation\u2019s employment in that same sector. Because BLS does not provide national farm estimates, note that there is no LQ for regional farm employment. For each county, the LQ is calculated as the share of the county\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the region\u2019s employment in that same sector.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-08-13T16:20:18.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-07-11T21:15:32.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-08-13T16:20:18.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-07-11T21:18:20.000Z", "columns_name": ["Quadrant", "LQ", "PercntChng_1990", "Jobs", "Year", "Industry", "Source", "Region"], "columns_field_name": ["quadrant", "lq", "percntchng_1990", "jobs", "year", "industry", "source", "region"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Quadrant for visualization", "Location quotient", "Percent change in jobs since 1990", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {"precision": "4"}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-07-11T21:18:20.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["economy", "infrastructure", "demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/ysen-ajs2", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Jobs-by-Industry-Location-Quotient-Bay/ysen-ajs2", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}
