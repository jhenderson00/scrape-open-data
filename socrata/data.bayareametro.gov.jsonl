Net costs reflect total operating costs minus farebox revenue (i.e. operating costs that are not directly funded by system users). The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, mode, and system tables for net cost per boarding, total cost per boarding, and farebox recovery ratio.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nFederal Transit Administration: National Transit Database\nhttp://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics: Consumer Price Index\nhttp://www.bls.gov/data/\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nSimple modes were aggregated to combine the various bus modes (e.g. rapid bus, express bus, local bus) into a single mode to avoid incorrect conclusions resulting from mode recoding over the lifespan of NTD. For other metro areas, operators were identified by developing a list of all urbanized areas within a current MSA boundary and then using that UZA list to flag relevant operators; this means that all operators (both large and small) were included in the metro comparison data. Financial data was inflation-adjusted to match 2015 dollar values using metro-specific Consumer Price Indices.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-07-08T22:08:04.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-07-01T17:21:47.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-07-01T17:21:50.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-07-08T22:08:04.000Z", "columns_name": ["Objectid", "Year", "Source1", "Region", "Netcostperboard_Ia", "Fareperboard_Ia", "Costperboard_Ia", "Source2", "Farebox_Ratio"], "columns_field_name": ["objectid", "year", "source1", "region", "netcostperboard_ia", "fareperboard_ia", "costperboard_ia", "source2", "farebox_ratio"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["objectid", "Year", "Source1", "Region", "Net Cost Per Boarding (Inflation Adjusted)", "Fare Per Boarding (Inflation Adjusted)", "Cost Per Boarding (Inflation Adjusted)", "Source2", "Ratio of Fare to Cost Per Boarding"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-07-01T17:21:50.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Transportation", "domain_tags": ["t13", "vital signs", "vital signs 2.0"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/kxp3-e2vh", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/Transportation/Vital-Signs-Transit-Cost-Effectiveness-Bay-Area-20/kxp3-e2vh", "owner": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}, "creator": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}}

Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) receive federal funds from HUD to administer the voucher program, and housing subsidies are paid to the landlord directly by the PHA on behalf of the participating family. The voucher recipient remains responsible for paying any difference that exists between the actual rent charged by the landlord and the amount subsidized by the program. Voucher recipients are responsible for finding a suitable housing unit where the owner agrees to rent under the program. Because housing assistance is provided on behalf of the family or individual, participants are free to choose their own housing, including single-family homes, townhouses, and apartments provided that the chosen housing meets the requirements of the program, and is not limited to units located in subsidized housing projects.

Data for individual collisions is reported by the California Highway Patrol (CHP) to the Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System (SWITRS). The data was tabulated using provided categories specifying injury level, individuals involved, causes of collision and location/jurisdiction of collision (for more information refer to the SWITRS codebook - http://tims.berkeley.edu/help/files/switrs_codebook.doc). For case data, latitude and longitude information for each accident is geocoded by SafeTREC\u2019s Transportation Injury Mapping System (TIMS). Fatalities were normalized over historic population data from the US Census Bureau\u2019s population estimates and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) data from the Federal Highway Administration.\n\nThe crash data only include crashes that involved a motor vehicle. Bicyclist and pedestrian fatalities that did not involve a motor vehicle, such as a bicyclist and pedestrian collision or a bicycle crash due to a pothole, are not included in the data.\n\nFor more regarding reporting procedures and injury classification, refer to the CHP Manual - https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ca_chp555_manual_2_2003_ch1-13.pdf.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-13T17:54:32.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-07-05T22:01:49.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-13T17:54:32.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-10-27T06:35:35.000Z", "columns_name": ["Fatalitiesmotorists", "Fatalitiesper100Mvmt_5Yr", "Fatalitiesper100Kcapita_5Yr", "Fatalities_5Yr", "Fatalitiespedestrian_5Yr", "Fatalitiespassenger_5Yr", "Fatalitiesother_5Yr", "Fatalitiesdriver_5Yr", "Fatalitiesper100Mvmt", "Fatalitiesper100Kcapita", "Fatalitiesdriver", "Year", "Objectid", "Fatalitiesmotorists_5Yr", "Fatalitiesbicyclist_5Yr", "Vmt", "Fatalitiespedestrian", "Fatalitiespassenger", "Population", "Fatalities", "Fatalitiesother", "Fatalitiesbicyclist", "Geography", "Source2", "Source3", "Source1"], "columns_field_name": ["fatalitiesmotorists", "fatalitiesper100mvmt_5yr", "fatalitiesper100kcapita_5yr", "fatalities_5yr", "fatalitiespedestrian_5yr", "fatalitiespassenger_5yr", "fatalitiesother_5yr", "fatalitiesdriver_5yr", "fatalitiesper100mvmt", "fatalitiesper100kcapita", "fatalitiesdriver", "year", "objectid", "fatalitiesmotorists_5yr", "fatalitiesbicyclist_5yr", "vmt", "fatalitiespedestrian", "fatalitiespassenger", "population", "fatalities", "fatalitiesother", "fatalitiesbicyclist", "geography", "source2", "source3", "source1"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "Fatalitiesper100Mvmt 5Yr", "Fatalitiesper100Kcapita 5Yr", "Fatalities 5Yr", "Fatalitiespedestrian 5Yr", "Fatalitiespassenger 5Yr", "Fatalitiesother 5Yr", "Fatalitiesdriver 5Yr", "Fatalitiesper100Mvmt", "Fatalitiesper100Kcapita", "Fatalitiesdriver", "Year of Incury", "Objectid", "", "Fatalitiesbicyclist 5Yr", "Annual Vehicle Miles Traveled", "Fatalitiespedestrian", "Fatalitiespassenger", "Total Population", "Fatalities", "Fatalitiesother", "Fatalitiesbicyclist", "County", "Source for Population", "Source for VMT", "Source for Injury Data"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-10-27T06:12:21.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Environment", "domain_tags": ["en4", "vital signs", "vital signs 2.0"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/mgxy-4gar", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/Environment/Vital-Signs-Fatalities-From-Crashes-Bay-Area-2022-/mgxy-4gar", "owner": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}, "creator": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}}

Total delay, a companion measure, includes both congested delay and all other delay in which speeds are below the posted speed limit.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nMetropolitan Transportation Commission: Historical Congestion Analysis\n\nCalifornia Department of Finance Forms E-5 and E-8\nhttp://www.dof.ca.gov/research/demographic/reports/estimates/e-8/\nhttp://www.dof.ca.gov/research/demographic/reports/estimates/e-5/2011-20/view.php\n\nCalifornia Employment Development Department: Labor Market Information\nhttp://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov/\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nDelay statistics only include freeway facilities and rely upon INRIX traffic data. They reflect delay on a typical weekday, which is defined as Tuesday through Thursday during peak traffic months. Delay statistics emphasize recurring delay - i.e. consistent delay greater than 15 minutes on a specific freeway segment. Congested delay is defined as congestion occurring with speeds less than 35 mph and is commonly recognized as inefficient delay (meaning that the freeway corridor is operating at speeds low enough to reduce throughput - as opposed to speeds greater than 35 mph which increase throughput). Data sources listed above were used to calculate per-capita and per-worker statistics; national datasets were used for metro comparisons and California datasets were used for the Bay Area. Top congested corridors are ranked by total vehicle hours of delay, meaning that the highlighted corridors reflect a combination of slow speeds and heavy traffic volumes. Historical Bay Area data was estimated by MTC Operations staff using a combination of internal datasets to develop an approximate trend back to 1998. The metropolitan area comparison was performed for the combined primary urbanized areas (San Francisco-Oakland and San Jose) as well as nine other major metropolitan areas' core urbanized area. Because the Texas Transportation Institute no longer reports congested freeway delay or total freeway delay (focusing solely on total regional delay), 2011 data was used to estimate 2014 total freeway delay for each metro area by relying upon the freeway-to-regional ratio from 2011. Estimated urbanized area workers were used for this analysis using the 2011 ratios, which accounts for slight differentials between Bay Area data points under the regional historical data and the metro comparison analysis.

The California Highway Patrol classifies a serious injury as any combination of the following: broken bones; dislocated or distorted limbs; severe lacerations; skull, spinal, chest or abdominal injuries that go beyond visible injuries; unconsciousness at or when taken from the scene; or severe burns.

Vital Signs tracks greenhouse gas emissions linked to consumption from the three largest sources in the region: surface transportation, electricity consumption, and natural gas consumption. This measure helps track progress towards achieving regional greenhouse gas reduction targets, including the region's per-capita greenhouse gas target for surface transportation under Senate Bill 375.

Note that 2014 data was excluded to data abnormalities for several counties in the region; methodology improvements in 2012 affected estimated by +/- 5% according to CEC estimates. For years 2013 and 2014, a linear trendline assumption was used instead between 2012 and 2015 data points. Greenhouse gas emissions are calculated based on the gallons of gasoline and diesel sales, relying upon standardized Energy Information Administration conversion rates for E10 fuel (gasoline with 10% ethanol) and standard diesel. Per-capita greenhouse gas emissions are calculated simply by dividing emissions attributable to fuel sold in that county by the total number of county residents; there may be a slight bias in the data given that a fraction of fuel sold in a given county may be purchased by non-residents.\r\n\r\nFor electricity consumption, the dataset is based on electricity consumption data for the nine Bay Area counties; note that this is different than electricity production as the region imports electricity. Because such data is not disaggregated by utility provider, a simple assumption is made that electricity consumed has the greenhouse gas emissions intensity (on a kilowatt-hour basis) of Pacific Gas & Electric, the primary electricity provider in the Bay Area. For this reason, with the small but growing market share of low- and zero-GHG community choice aggregation (CCA) providers, the greenhouse gas emissions estimate in more recent years may be slightly

Similarly, modal data is not available for every Bay Area city or census tract, even when the 5-year data is used for those localized geographies.\n\nRegional commute times were calculated by summing aggregate county travel times and dividing by the relevant population; similarly, modal commute time were calculated using aggregate times and dividing by the number of communities choosing that mode for the given geography.

Note that 2014 data was excluded to data abnormalities for several counties in the region; methodology improvements in 2012 affected estimated by +/- 5% according to CEC estimates. For years 2013 and 2014, a linear trendline assumption was used instead between 2012 and 2015 data points. Greenhouse gas emissions are calculated based on the gallons of gasoline and diesel sales, relying upon standardized Energy Information Administration conversion rates for E10 fuel (gasoline with 10% ethanol) and standard diesel. Per-capita greenhouse gas emissions are calculated simply by dividing emissions attributable to fuel sold in that county by the total number of county residents; there may be a slight bias in the data given that a fraction of fuel sold in a given county may be purchased by non-residents.\r\n\r\nFor electricity consumption, the dataset is based on electricity consumption data for the nine Bay Area counties; note that this is different than electricity production as the region imports electricity. Because such data is not disaggregated by utility provider, a simple assumption is made that electricity consumed has the greenhouse gas emissions intensity (on a kilowatt-hour basis) of Pacific Gas & Electric, the primary electricity provider in the Bay Area. For this reason, with the small but growing market share of low- and zero-GHG community choice aggregation (CCA) providers, the greenhouse gas emissions estimate in more recent years may be slightly

The unemployment rate reflects the strength of the overall employment market.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nCalifornia Employment Development Department: Historical Unemployment Rates  \n1990-2010  \nSpreadsheet provided by CAEDD\n\nCalifornia Employment Development Department: Labor Force and Unemployment Rate for California Sub-County Areas - https://data.edd.ca.gov/Labor-Force-and-Unemployment-Rates/Labor-Force-and-Unemployment-Rate-for-California-S/8z4h-2ak6  \n2010-2022\n\nCalifornia Employment Development Department: Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) - https://data.edd.ca.gov/Labor-Force-and-Unemployment-Rates/Local-Area-Unemployment-Statistics-LAUS-/e6gw-gvii  \n1990-2022\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics: Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) - https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/la  \n1990-2021\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nUnemployment rates produced by the CA Employment Development Department (EDD) for the region and county levels are not adjusted for seasonality (as they reflect annual data) and are final data (i.e., not preliminary). Unemployment rates produced by U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for the metro regions are annual and not adjusted for seasonality; they reflect the primary metropolitan statistical area (MSA) for the named region, except for the San Francisco Bay Area which uses the nine-county region. The unemployment rate is calculated based on the number of unemployed persons divided by the total labor force.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides estimates of employment for metropolitan areas outside of the Bay Area. Annual employment data are derived from monthly estimates and thus reflect \u201cannual average employment.\u201d Employment estimates outside of the Bay Area do not include farm employment. For the metropolitan area comparison, farm employment was removed from Bay Area employment totals. Both EDD and BLS data report only wage and salary jobs, not the self-employed.\n\nFor measuring jobs below the county level, Vital Signs assigns collections of incorporated cities and towns to sub-county areas. For example, the cities of East Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Portola Valley, Redwood City and Woodside are considered South San Mateo County. Because Bay Area counties differ in footprint, the number of sub-county city groupings varies from one (San Francisco and San Jose counties) to four (Santa Clara County). Estimates for sub-county areas are the sums of city-level estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey (ACS) 2010-2017.\n\nThe following incorporated cities and towns are included in each sub-county area:\nNorth Alameda County \u2013 Alameda, Albany, Berkeley, Emeryville, Oakland, Piedmont\nEast Alameda County - Dublin, Livermore, Pleasanton\nSouth Alameda County - Fremont, Hayward, Newark, San Leandro, Union City\nCentral Contra Costa County - Clayton, Concord, Danville, Lafayette, Martinez, Moraga, Orinda, Pleasant Hill, San Ramon, Walnut Creek\nEast Contra Costa County - Antioch, Brentwood, Oakley, Pittsburg\nWest Contra Costa County - El Cerrito, Hercules, Pinole, Richmond, San Pablo\nMarin \u2013 all incorporated cities and towns\nNapa \u2013 all incorporated cities and towns\nSan Francisco \u2013 San Francisco\nNorth San Mateo - Brisbane, Colma, Daly City, Millbrae, Pacifica, San Bruno, South San Francisco\nCentral San Mateo - Belmont, Burlingame, Foster City, Half Moon Bay, Hillsborough, San Carlos, San Mateo\nSouth San Mateo - East Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Portola Valley, Redwood City, Woodside\nNorth Santa Clara - Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Milpitas, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Santa Clara, Sunnyvale\nSan Jose \u2013 San Jose\nSouthwest Santa Clara - Campbell, Cupertino, Los Gatos, Monte Sereno, Saratoga\nSouth Santa Clara - Gilroy, Morgan Hill\nEast Solano - Dixon, Fairfield, Rio Vista, Suisun City, Vacaville\nSouth Solano - Benicia, Vallejo\nNorth Sonoma - Cloverdale, Healdsburg, Windsor\nSouth Sonoma - Cotati, Petaluma, Rohnert Park, Santa Rosa, Sebastopol, Sonoma", "attribution": "Bureau of Labor Statistics", "attribution_link": "http://www.bls.gov/data/", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2020-04-13T23:20:28.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-10-05T00:44:00.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-04-13T23:20:28.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-10-25T20:52:33.000Z", "columns_name": ["Diff_1990", "PercentChng_2000", "Source", "Diff_2010", "Metro", "PercentChng_2010", "PercentChng_1990", "Jobs", "Year", "Diff_2000"], "columns_field_name": ["diff_1990", "percentchng_2000", "source", "diff_2010", "metro", "percentchng_2010", "percentchng_1990", "jobs", "year", "diff_2000"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Change in number of jobs since 1990", "Percent change in number of workers since 2000", "", "Change in number of jobs since 2010", "Metro", "Percent change in number of workers since 2010", "Percent change in number of workers since 1990", "Number of workers in a given geography by year", "", "Change in number of jobs since 2000"], "columns_format": [{}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}, {}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-10-05T00:47:56.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["economy", "demographics", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/n6rf-8ww2", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Jobs-by-metro/n6rf-8ww2", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, mode and operator tables for total typical weekday boardings.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nFederal Transit Administration: National Transit Database - http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm  \n1991-2022\n\nCalifornia Department of Finance: E-4 Historical Population Estimates for Cities, Counties, and the State - https://dof.ca.gov/forecasting/demographics/estimates/  \n1991-2022\n\nUS Census Population and Housing Unit Estimates - https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest.html  \n1991-2022\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nThe National Transit Database (NTD) dataset was lightly cleaned to correct for erroneous zero values - in which null values (unsubmitted data) were incorrectly marked as zeroes. Paratransit data is sparse in early years of the NTD dataset, meaning that transit ridership estimates in the early 1990s are likely underestimated. Simple modes were aggregated to combine the various bus modes (e.g. rapid bus, express bus, local bus) into a single mode to avoid incorrect conclusions resulting from mode recoding over the lifespan of NTD.\n\n2022 data should be considered preliminary, as it comes from the monthly data tables rather than the longer-term time series dataset. Weekday ridership is calculated by taking the total annual ridership and dividing by 300, an assumption which is consistent with MTC travel modeling procedures; it was also compared to observed weekday boarding data (which is more limited in availability) to ensure consistency on the regional level. Per-capita transit ridership is calculated for the operator's general service area or taxation district; for example, BART includes the three core counties (San Francisco, Alameda, and Contra Costa), as well as northern San Mateo County post-SFO extension, and AC Transit includes the cities located within its service area. For other metro areas, operators were identified by developing a list of all urbanized areas within a current MSA boundary and then using that UZA list to flag relevant operators; this means that all operators (both large and small) were included in the metro comparison data.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-13T17:54:58.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-06-29T19:52:27.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-13T17:54:58.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-10T23:13:08.000Z", "columns_name": ["Percapita_Annual_Boardings", "Year", "Source1", "Percentchg_1991", "Source2", "Population", "Annual_Boardings", "Region", "Objectid"], "columns_field_name": ["percapita_annual_boardings", "year", "source1", "percentchg_1991", "source2", "population", "annual_boardings", "region", "objectid"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Annual Boardings per Capita", "Year", "Source 1", "Ridership Change Since 1991", "Source 2", "population", "Annual Boardings", "Bay Area", "objectid"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-06-29T19:52:30.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Transportation", "domain_tags": ["t11t12", "vital signs", "vital signs 2.0"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/naeu-hmgq", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/Transportation/Vital-Signs-Transit-Ridership-per-Capita-Bay-Area-/naeu-hmgq", "owner": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}, "creator": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}}

Income data highlight how employees are being compensated for their work on an inflation-adjusted basis.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census - https://nhgis.org  \nCount 4Pb (1970)  \nForm STF3 (1980-1990)  \nForm SF3a (2000)\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey - https://data.census.gov/  \nForm B19001 (2005-2021; household income by place of residence)  \nForm B19013 (2005-2021; median household income by place of residence)  \nForm B08521 (2005-2021; median worker earnings by place of employment)\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics: Consumer Price Index - https://www.bls.gov/data/  \n1970-2021\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nIncome derived from the decennial Census data reflects the income earned in the prior calendar year, whereas income derived from the American Community Survey (ACS) data reflects the prior 12 month period; note that this inconsistency has a minor effect on historical comparisons (see Income and Earnings Data section of the ACS General Handbook - https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2020/acs/acs_general_handbook_2020_ch09.pdf). ACS 1-year data is used for larger geographies \u2013 Bay counties and most metropolitan area counties \u2013 while smaller geographies rely upon 5-year rolling average data due to their smaller sample sizes. Note that 2020 data uses the 5-year estimates because the ACS did not collect 1-year data for 2020.\n\nQuintile income for 1970-2000 is imputed from decennial Census data using methodology from the California Department of Finance. Bay Area income is the population weighted average of county-level income.\n\nIncome has been inflated using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for 2021 specific to each metro area; however, some metro areas lack metro-specific CPI data back to 1970 and therefore adjusted data uses national CPI for 1970.

{"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Rent Payments \u2013 by metro (2022)", "id": "nj8n-6qeh", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR  \nRent Payments (EC8)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME  \nMedian rent payment\n\nLAST UPDATED  \nJanuary 2023\n\nDESCRIPTION  \nRent payments refer to the cost of leasing an apartment or home and serves as a measure of housing costs for individuals who do not own a home. The data reflect the median monthly rent paid by Bay Area households across apartments and homes of various sizes and various levels of quality. This differs from advertised rents for available apartments, which usually are higher. Note that rent can be presented using nominal or real (inflation-adjusted) dollar values; data are presented inflation-adjusted to reflect changes in household purchasing power over time.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census - https://nhgis.org  \nCount 2 (1970)  \nForm STF1 (1980-1990)  \nForm SF3a (2000)\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey - https://data.census.gov/  \nForm B25058 (2005-2021; median contract rent)\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics: Consumer Price Index - https://www.bls.gov/data/  \n1970-2021\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nRent data reflects median rent payments rather than list rents (refer to measure definition above). American Community Survey 1-year data is used for larger geographies \u2013 Bay counties and most metropolitan area counties \u2013 while smaller geographies rely upon 5-year rolling average data due to their smaller sample sizes. Note that 2020 data uses the 5-year estimates because the ACS did not collect 1-year data for 2020.\n\n1970 Census data for median rent payments has been imputed from quintiles using methodology from California Department of Finance as the source data only provided the mean, rather than the median, monthly rent. Metro area boundaries reflects today\u2019s metro area definitions by county for consistency, rather than historical metro area boundaries.\n\nInflation-adjusted data are presented to illustrate how rent payments have grown relative to overall price increases; that said, the use of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) does create some challenges given the fact that housing represents a major chunk of consumer goods bundle used to calculate CPI. This reflects a methodological tradeoff between precision and accuracy and is a common concern when working with any commodity that is a major component of CPI itself.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-20T17:48:34.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-06-14T17:48:52.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-20T17:48:34.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-01T00:38:57.000Z", "columns_name": ["Median_Contract_Rent_IA", "Median_Contract_Rent", "Source", "Median_Contract_Rent_IA_PercentChg_1970", "Metro", "Year", "CBSA", "Median_Contract_Rent_IA_PercentChg_2000"], "columns_field_name": ["median_contract_rent_ia", "median_contract_rent", "source", "median_contract_rent_ia_perchg1970", "metro", "year", "cbsa", "median_contract_rent_ia_perchg2000"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-06-14T17:52:28.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/nj8n-6qeh", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Rent-Payments-by-metro-2022-/nj8n-6qeh", "owner": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}, "creator": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}}

For the decennial Census datasets, the breakdown of auto commuters between drive alone and carpool is not available before 1980. American Community Survey 1-year data is used for larger geographies \u2013 Bay counties and most metropolitan area counties \u2013 while smaller geographies rely upon 5-year rolling average data due to their smaller sample sizes. This will result in discrepancies in cases like San Francisco where it is both a city and a county. Note that 2020 data uses the 5-year estimates because the ACS did not collect 1-year data for 2020. Additionally, for the County by place of residence breakdown, Napa was missing ACS 1-Year commute mode choice data for all modes for 2007, 2008, 2011 and 2021. 5-Year estimates were used to fill the missing data for 2011 and 2021, but not 2007 or 2008 since the 5-Year estimates start in 2009.\n\nRegional mode shares are population-weighted averages of the nine counties' modal shares. \"Auto\" includes drive alone and carpool for the simple data tables and is broken out in the detailed data tables accordingly, as it was not available before 1980. \"Transit\" includes public operators (Muni, BART, etc.) and employer-provided shuttles (e.g., Google shuttle buses). \"Other\" includes motorcycle, taxi, and other modes of transportation; bicycle mode share was broken out separately for the first time in the 2006 data and is shown in the detailed data tables. Census tract data is not available for tracts with insufficient numbers of residents or workers.\n\nThe metropolitan area comparison was performed for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area in addition to the primary metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) for other major metropolitan areas.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-20T17:13:57.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-07-08T00:04:00.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-20T17:13:57.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-01-31T23:54:42.000Z", "columns_name": ["Share", "Source", "Mode", "Year", "Region", "Data_Type"], "columns_field_name": ["share", "source", "mode", "year", "region", "data_type"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-07-08T00:04:02.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/nmtw-k5b6", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Commute-Mode-Choice-by-Place-of-Reside/nmtw-k5b6", "owner": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}, "creator": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}}

This measure reflects the changing industry trends that affect our region\u2019s workers.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nBureau of Labor Statistics, Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) - https://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm  \n1990-2021  \n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nQuarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) employment data is reported by the place of work and represent the number of covered workers who worked during, or received pay for, the pay period that included the 12th day of the month. Covered employees in the private-sector and in the state and local government include most corporate officials, all executives, all supervisory personnel, all professionals, all clerical workers, many farmworkers, all wage earners, all piece workers and all part-time workers. Workers on paid sick leave, paid holiday, paid vacation and the like are also covered.\n\nBesides excluding the aforementioned national security agencies, QCEW excludes proprietors, the unincorporated self-employed, unpaid family members, certain farm and domestic workers exempted from having to report employment data and railroad workers covered by the railroad unemployment insurance system. Excluded as well are workers who earned no wages during the entire applicable pay period because of work stoppages, temporary layoffs, illness or unpaid vacations. \n\nThe location quotient (LQ) is used to evaluate level of concentration or clustering of an industry within the Bay Area and within each county of the region. A location quotient greater than 1 means there is a strong concentration for of jobs in an industry sector. For the Bay Area, the LQ is calculated as the share of the region\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of California's employment in that same sector. For each county, the LQ is calculated as the share of the county\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the region\u2019s employment in that same sector.\n\nData is mainly pulled from aggregation level 73, which is county-level summarized at the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) supersector level (12 sectors). This aggregation level exhibits the least loss due to data suppression, in the magnitude of 1-2 percent for regional employment, and is therefore preferred. However, the supersectors group together NAICS 11 Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting; NAICS 21 Mining and NAICS 23 Construction. To provide a separate tally of Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting, the aggregation level 74 data was used for NAICS codes 11, 21 and 23. \n\nQCEW reports on employment in Public Administration as NAICS 92. However, many government activities are reported with an industry specific code - such as transportation or utilities even if those may be public governmental entities. In 2021 for the Bay Area, the largest industry groupings under public ownership are Education and health services (58%); Public administration (29%) and Trade, transportation, and utilities (29%). With the exception of Education and health services, all other public activities were coded as government/public administration, regardless of industry group.\n\nFor the county data there were some industries that reported 0 jobs or did not report jobs at the desired aggregation/NAICS level for the following counties/years:\n\nFarm:  \n(aggregation level: 74, NAICS code: 11)\n- Contra Costa: 2008-2010\n- Marin: 1990-2006, 2008-2010, 2014-2020\n- Napa: 1990-2004, 2013-2021\n- San Francisco: 2019-2020\n- San Mateo: 2013\n\nInformation:  \n(aggregation level: 73, NAICS code: 51)\n- Solano: 2001\n\nFinancial Activities:  \n(aggregatio", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-13T17:54:02.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-06-10T00:58:59.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-13T17:54:02.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-07-06T20:51:09.000Z", "columns_name": ["Other", "Total", "Ttu", "Pbs", "Lh", "Inform", "Govt", "Farm", "Fa", "Ehs", "Objectid", "Uncl", "Manuf", "Year", "Geoname", "Mlc", "Source"], "columns_field_name": ["other", "total", "ttu", "pbs", "lh", "inform", "govt", "farm", "fa", "ehs", "objectid", "uncl", "manuf", "year", "geoname", "mlc", "source"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Other Service Employment", "Total Employment", "Trade, transportation, and utilities Employment", "Professional and business services Employment", "Leisure and hospitality Employment", "Information Employment", "Government Employment", "farm", "Financial activities Employment", "Education and health services Employment", "objectid", "Unclassified Employment", "Manufacturing Employment", "Year", "Geography", "Natural resources, mining and construction Employment", "Source"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-06-10T00:59:02.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Economy", "domain_tags": ["ec1", "vital signs", "vital signs 2.0"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/npq9-pyu8", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/Economy/Vital-Signs-Jobs-By-Industry-Bay-Area-2022-/npq9-pyu8", "owner": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}, "creator": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}}

The Porter-Cologne Act is recognized as one of the nation's strongest pieces of anti-pollution legislation, and was so influential that Congressional authors used sections of the Act as the basis for the Federal Clean Water Act.\n\nMany California State GIS layers can be downloaded at this URL\nhttps://gis.data.ca.gov/", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2021-09-10T02:54:04.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-09-10T02:53:58.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2021-09-10T02:54:00.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2021-09-10T02:54:04.000Z", "columns_name": ["WEBPAGE", "PHONE", "Shape__Length", "DISTRICT", "CITY/ZIP", "ADDRESS", "Region", "OBJECTID", "Shape__Area", "the_geom"], "columns_field_name": ["weburl", "phone", "shape_length", "dist", "city_zip", "street", "region", "objectid", "shape_area", "the_geom"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "MultiPolygon"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2021-09-10T02:54:00.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/nrxy-njbq", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Caltrans-Districts/nrxy-njbq", "owner": {"id": "gmr7-ynpt", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kearey Smith"}, "creator": {"id": "gmr7-ynpt", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kearey Smith"}}

The annual production count captures housing units added by new construction and annexations, subtracts demolitions and destruction from natural disasters, and adjusts for units lost or gained by conversions.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nCalifornia Department of Finance\nForm E-8\n1990-2010\nhttp://www.dof.ca.gov/Forecasting/Demographics/Estimates/E-8/\n\nCalifornia Department of Finance\nForm E-5\n2011-2018\nhttp://www.dof.ca.gov/Forecasting/Demographics/Estimates/E-5/\n\nU.S. Census Bureau Population Estimates\n2000-2018\nhttps://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest.html\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nSingle-family housing units include single detached units and single attached units. Multi-family housing includes two to four units and five plus or apartment units.\n\nHousing production data for metropolitan areas for each year is the difference of annual housing unit estimates from the Census Bureau\u2019s Population Estimates Program. Housing production data for the region, counties, and cities for each year is the difference of annual housing unit estimates from the California Department of Finance. Department of Finance data uses an annual cycle between January 1 and December 31, whereas U.S. Census Bureau data uses an annual cycle from April 1 to March 31 of the following year.\n\nHousing production data shows how many housing units have been produced over time. Like housing permit statistics, housing production numbers are an indicator of where the region is growing. However, since permitted units are sometimes not constructed or there can be a long lag time between permit approval and the start of construction, production data also reflects the effects of barriers to housing production. These range from a lack of builder confidence to high construction costs and limited financing. Data also differentiates the trends in multi-family, single-family and mobile home production.", "attribution": "California Department of Finance", "attribution_link": "http://www.dof.ca.gov/Forecasting/Demographics/Estimates/", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2020-04-13T23:28:52.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-11-14T20:32:09.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-04-13T23:28:52.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-11-14T20:35:17.000Z", "columns_name": ["Source", "MFproduction", "SFproduction", "TOTALproduction", "City", "MHproduction", "MHproduction_avg annual", "County", "SFproduction_avg annual", "TOTALproduction_avg annual", "MFproduction_avg annual", "Years"], "columns_field_name": ["source", "mfproduction", "sfproduction", "totalproduction", "city", "mhproduction", "mhproduction_avg_annual", "county", "sfproduction_avg_annual", "totalproduction_avg_annual", "mfproduction_avg_annual", "years"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "Net change in number of multi-family housing units by decade", "Net change in number of single-family housing units by decade", "Net change in number of housing units by decade", "", "Net change in number of mobile home housing units by decade", "Average annual net change in number of mobile home housing units by decade", "", "Average annual net change in number of single-family housing units by decade", "Average annual net change in number of housing units by decade", "Average annual net change in number of multi-family housing units by decade", "Decade"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-11-14T20:35:18.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "housing & development", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/nt4i-ub6s", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Housing-Production-by-city-be-decade/nt4i-ub6s", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

Multi-family housing includes two to four units and five plus or apartment units.\n\nHousing production data for metropolitan areas for each year is the difference of annual housing unit estimates from the Census Bureau\u2019s Population Estimates Program. Housing production data for the region, counties, and cities for each year is the difference of annual housing unit estimates from the California Department of Finance. Department of Finance data uses an annual cycle between January 1 and December 31, whereas U.S. Census Bureau data uses an annual cycle from April 1 to March 31 of the following year.\n\nHousing production data shows how many housing units have been produced over time. Like housing permit statistics, housing production numbers are an indicator of where the region is growing. However, since permitted units are sometimes not constructed or there can be a long lag time between permit approval and the start of construction, production data also reflects the effects of barriers to housing production.

The annual production count captures housing units added by new construction and annexations, subtracts demolitions and destruction from natural disasters, and adjusts for units lost or gained by conversions.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nCalifornia Department of Finance\nForm E-8\n1990-2010\nhttp://www.dof.ca.gov/Forecasting/Demographics/Estimates/E-8/\n\nCalifornia Department of Finance\nForm E-5\n2011-2018\nhttp://www.dof.ca.gov/Forecasting/Demographics/Estimates/E-5/\n\nU.S. Census Bureau Population Estimates\n2000-2018\nhttps://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest.html\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nSingle-family housing units include single detached units and single attached units. Multi-family housing includes two to four units and five plus or apartment units.\n\nHousing production data for metropolitan areas for each year is the difference of annual housing unit estimates from the Census Bureau\u2019s Population Estimates Program. Housing production data for the region, counties, and cities for each year is the difference of annual housing unit estimates from the California Department of Finance. Department of Finance data uses an annual cycle between January 1 and December 31, whereas U.S. Census Bureau data uses an annual cycle from April 1 to March 31 of the following year.\n\nHousing production data shows how many housing units have been produced over time. Like housing permit statistics, housing production numbers are an indicator of where the region is growing. However, since permitted units are sometimes not constructed or there can be a long lag time between permit approval and the start of construction, production data also reflects the effects of barriers to housing production. These range from a lack of builder confidence to high construction costs and limited financing. Data also differentiates the trends in multi-family, single-family and mobile home production.", "attribution": "U.S. Census Bureau", "attribution_link": "https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest.html", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2020-04-13T23:29:34.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-11-14T19:50:24.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-04-13T23:29:34.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-11-14T19:53:21.000Z", "columns_name": ["TOTALproduction_per1000capita", "Source", "Metro", "Year", "TOTALproduction", "Population"], "columns_field_name": ["totalproduction_per1000capita", "source", "metro", "year", "totalproduction", "population"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Number of new housing units produced for every 1,000 residents", "", "", "", "Net change in number of housing units since the previous year", "Total population"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-11-14T19:53:21.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "housing & development", "finance"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/p24r-id4u", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Housing-Production-by-metro/p24r-id4u", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

In the Bay Area, ozone is measured by over a dozen monitoring stations that record hourly concentrations used to determine compliance with national standards.

Data are used to calculate the 8-hour peak concentration for ozone.

Population estimates for PDAs are allocated from tract-level Census population counts using an area ratio. For example, if a quarter of a Census tract lies with in a PDA, a quarter of its population will be allocated to that PDA. Estimates of population density for PDAs use gross acres as the denominator.

Migration captures both voluntary relocation \u2013 for example, moving to another region for a better job or lower home prices \u2013 and involuntary relocation as a result of displacement. The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, and county tables. \n\nDATA SOURCE\nAmerican Community Survey County-to-County Migration Flows\n2012-2015\n5-year rolling average\nhttp://www.census.gov/topics/population/migration/data/tables.All.html\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nData for migration comes from the American Community Survey; county-to-county flow datasets experience a longer lag time than other standard datasets available in FactFinder. 5-year rolling average data was used for migration for all geographies, as the Census Bureau does not release 1-year annual data. Data is not available at any geography below the county level; note that flows that are relatively small on the county level are often within the margin of error. The metropolitan area comparison was performed for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area, in addition to the primary MSAs for the nine other major metropolitan areas, by aggregating county data based on current metropolitan area boundaries. Data prior to 2011 is not available on Vital Signs due to inconsistent Census formats and a lack of net migration statistics for prior years. Only counties with a non-negligible flow are shown in the data; all other pairs can be assumed to have zero migration.\n\nGiven that the vast majority of migration out of the region was to other counties in California, California counties were bundled into the following regions for simplicity:\nBay Area: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, Sonoma\nCentral Coast: Monterey, San Benito, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz\nCentral Valley: Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced, Tulare\nLos Angeles + Inland Empire: Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura\nSacramento: El Dorado, Placer, Sacramento, Sutter, Yolo, Yuba\nSan Diego: San Diego\nSan Joaquin Valley: San Joaquin, Stanislaus\nRural: all other counties (23)\n\nOne key limitation of the American Community Survey migration data is that it is not able to track emigration (movement of current U.S. residents to other countries). This is despite the fact that it is able to quantify immigration (movement of foreign residents to the U.S.), generally by continent of origin.

Regional and local geographies rely on data collected by real Answers, a research organization and database publisher specializing in the multifamily housing market. real Answers focuses on collecting longitudinal data for individual rental properties through quarterly surveys. For the Bay Area, their database is comprised of properties with 40 to 3,000+ housing units. Median list prices most likely have an upward bias due to the exclusion of smaller properties. The bias may be most extreme in geographies where large rental properties represent a small portion of the overall rental market. A map of the individual properties surveyed is included in the Local Focus section. \r\n\r\nIndividual properties surveyed provided lower- and upper-bound ranges for the various types of housing available (studio, 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, etc.). Median lower- and upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the regional and county geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the average of the median lower- and upper-bound prices for the region and counties. Median upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the city geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the median upper-bound price for cities. For simplicity, only the mean list rent is displayed for the individual properties. The metro areas geography rely upon Zillow data, which is the median price for rentals listed through www.zillow.com during the month. Like the real Answers data, Zillow's median list prices most likely have an upward bias since small properties are underrepresented in Zillow's listings. The metro area data for the Bay Area cannot be compared to the regional Bay Area data. Due to afore mentioned data limitations, this data is suitable for analyzing the change in list rents over time but not necessarily comparisons of absolute list rents. Metro area boundaries reflects today\u2019s metro area definitions by county for consistency, rather than historical metro area boundaries.\r\n\r\nDue to the limited number of rental properties surveyed, city-level data is unavailable for Atherton, Belvedere, Brisbane, Calistoga, Clayton, Cloverdale, Cotati, Fairfax, Half Moon Bay, Healdsburg, Hillsborough, Los Altos Hills, Monte Sereno, Moranga, Oakley, Orinda, Portola Valley, Rio Vista, Ross, San Anselmo, San Carlos, Saratoga, Sebastopol, Windsor, Woodside, and Yountville.\r\n\r\nInflation-adjusted data are presented to illustrate how rents have grown relative to overall price increases; that said, the use of the Consumer Price Index does create some challenges given the fact that housing represents a major chunk of consumer goods bundle used to calculate CPI.

The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, mode and operator tables for total typical weekday boardings.\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE\r\nFederal Transit Administration: National Transit Database\r\nhttp://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION\r\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\r\nThe NTD dataset was lightly cleaned to correct for erroneous zero values - in which null values (unsubmitted data) were incorrectly marked as zeroes. Paratransit data is sparse in early years of the NTD dataset, meaning that transit ridership estimates in the early 1990s are likely underestimated. Simple modes were aggregated to combine the various bus modes (e.g. rapid bus, express bus, local bus) into a single mode to avoid incorrect conclusions resulting from mode recoding over the lifespan of NTD.\r\n\r\n2016 data should be considered preliminary, as it comes from the monthly data tables rather than the longer-term time-series dataset. Weekday ridership is calculated by taking the total annual ridership and dividing by 300, an assumption which is consistent with MTC travel modeling procedures; it was also compared to observed weekday boarding data (which is more limited in availability) to ensure consistency on the regional level. Per-capita transit ridership is calculated for the operator's general service area or taxation district; for example, BART includes the three core counties (San Francisco, Alameda, and Contra Costa) as well as northern San Mateo County post-SFO extension and AC Transit includes the cities located within its service area. For other metro areas, operators were identified by developing a list of all urbanized areas within a current MSA boundary and then using that UZA list to flag relevant operators; this means that all operators (both large and small) were included in the metro comparison data.", "attribution": "Federal Transit Administration: National Transit Database", "attribution_link": "http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-29T23:30:44.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-05-24T19:33:28.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-07-06T18:04:44.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-29T23:30:44.000Z", "columns_name": ["PercentChg_1991", "Mode", "Region", "Est_Weekday_Boardings", "Annual_Boardings", "Year", "Source"], "columns_field_name": ["percentchg_1991", "mode", "region", "est_weekday_boardings", "annual_boardings", "year", "source"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Percent change from 1991 ridership levels", "Type of public transit (bus, heavy rail, etc.)", "", "Passenger boardings on an average day", "Annual passenger boardings", "", ""], "columns_format": [{"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-06-05T20:52:27.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["transportation", "economy", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/pksj-2mmj", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Transit-Ridership-by-Mode-by-Bay-Area/pksj-2mmj", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

{"resource": {"name": "HCD Racially Concentrated Areas of Affluence ACS 2019", "id": "q89j-amyf", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Racially Concentrated Areas of Affluence (RCAA's)\n\nThe concept of Racially Concentrated Areas of Affluence (RCAAs) was originally developed by scholars at the University of Minnesota to illustrate the flip side of the Racially and Ethnically Concentrated Areas of Poverty (R/ECAPs) metric used by the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) in the 2015 Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) rule to more fully tell the story of segregation in the United States.\n\nAs stated in HCD\u2019s AFFH Guidance Memo, when analyzing patterns and trends of segregation and proposing policy approaches in the Housing Element, localities should not only focus on communities of color. Segregation is a continuum, with polarity between race, poverty, and affluence, which can be a direct product of the same policies and practices. To better evaluate these conditions, both sides of the continuum should be considered and compare patterns within the community and across the region. This more holistic approach will better unveil deeply rooted policies and practices and improve identification and prioritization of contributing factors to inform more meaningful actions.\n\nHCD has created a new version of the RCAA metric to better reflect California\u2019s relative diversity and regional conditions, and to aid local jurisdictions in their analysis of racially concentrated areas of poverty and affluence pursuant to AB 686 and AB 1304. HCD\u2019s RCAA metric is provided as a resource to be paired with local data and knowledge \u2013 jurisdictions are encouraged but not required to use the RCAA layer provided by HCD in their housing element analyses.\n\nTo develop the RCAA layer, staff first calculated a Location Quotient (LQ) for each California census tract using data from the 2015-2019 American Community Survey data. This LQ represents the percentage of total white population (White Alone, Not Hispanic or Latino) for each census tract compared to the average percentage of total white population for all census tracts in a given Council of Governments' (COG) region. For example, a census tract with a LQ of 1.5 has a percentage of total white population that is 1.5 times higher than the average percentage of total white population in the given COG region.\n\nTo determine the RCAAs, census tracts with a LQ of more than 1.25 and a median income 1.5 times higher than the COG Area Median Income (AMI) (or 1.5x the State AMI, whichever is lower) were assigned a numeric score of 1 (Is a RCAA). Census tracts that did not meet this criterion were assigned a score of 0 (Not a RCAA).\n\nCOG AMI was determined by averaging the 2019 ACS established AMI's for each county within the given COG region. 2019 ACS AMI limits can be found here: https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219 [census.gov]. State AMI was based on the ACS 2019 California state AMI ($75,235), which can be found here: https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/CA/INC110219 [census.gov].\n\nCensus tracts with a total population of less than 75 people, in which the census tract was also largely contained within a non-urbanized area such as a park, open space, or airport, were not identified as RCAAs.\n\nData Source:\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS), 2015-2019\n\nReferences:\nWilson, William J.

The data was assembled by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission from multiple shapefiles provided by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The SRA data was extracted from a statewide shapefile and the LRA data is a combination of county shapefiles. All source data was downloaded from the Office of the State Fire Marshal's Fire Hazard Severity Zones Maps page (https://osfm.fire.ca.gov/divisions/community-wildfire-preparedness-and-mitigation/wildland-hazards-building-codes/fire-hazard-severity-zones-maps/). **\n\nState Responsibility Areas\nPRC 4201 - 4204 and Govt. Code 51175-89 direct CAL FIRE to map areas of significant fire hazards based on fuels, terrain, weather, and other relevant factors. These zones, referred to as Fire Hazard Severity Zones (FHSZ), define the application of various mitigation strategies to reduce risk associated with wildland fires.\n\nCAL FIRE is remapping FHSZ for SRA and Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones (VHFHSZ) recommendations in LRA to provide updated map zones, based on new data, science, and technology.\n\nLocal Responsibility Areas\nGovernment Code 51175-89 directs the CAL FIRE to identify areas of very high fire hazard severity zones within LRA.  Mapping of the areas, referred to as VHFHSZ, is based on data and models of, potential fuels over a 30-50 year time horizon and their associated expected fire behavior, and expected burn probabilities to quantify the likelihood and nature of vegetation fire exposure (including firebrands) to buildings.  Details on the project and specific modeling methodology can be found at https://frap.cdf.ca.gov/projects/hazard/methods.html.  Local Responsibility Area VHFHSZ maps were initially developed in the mid-1990s and are now being updated based on improved science, mapping techniques, and data.\n\nLocal government had 120 days to designate, by ordinance, very high fire hazard severity zones within their jurisdiction after receiving the CAL FIRE recommendations. Local governments were able to add additional VHFHSZs. There was no requirement for local government to report their final action to CAL FIRE when the recommended zones are adopted. Consequently, users are directed to the appropriate local entity (county, city, fire department, or Fire Protection District) to determine the status of the local fire hazard severity zone ordinance.\n\nIn late 2005, to be effective in 2008, the California Building Commission adopted California Building Code Chapter 7A requiring new buildings in VHFHSZs to use ignition resistant construction methods and materials. These new codes include provisions to improve the ignition resistance of buildings, especially from firebrands. The updated very high fire hazard severity zones will be used by building officials for new building permits in LRA. The updated zones will also be used to identify property whose owners must comply with natural hazards disclosure requirements at time of property sale and 100 foot defensible space clearance. It is likely that the fire hazard severity zones will be used for updates to the safety element of general plans.", "attribution": "California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE)", "attribution_link": "https://osfm.fire.ca.gov/divisions/community-wildfire-preparedness-and-mitigation/wildfire-preparedness/fire-hazard-severity-zones/fire-hazard-severity-zones-map/", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-09T19:12:13.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-09-30T03:45:54.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-09T19:12:13.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2020-12-18T23:15:03.000Z", "columns_name": ["haz_class", "Shape_Length", "Shape_Area", "haz_code", "fra", "fipco", "geometry", "incorp"], "columns_field_name": ["haz_class", "shape_length", "shape_area", "haz_code", "fra", "fipco", "geometry", "incorp"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "MultiPolygon", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Fire Hazard Severity Zone class name.

It reflects the number of individuals who are economically struggling due to low household income levels.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nU.S Census Bureau: Decennial Census - http://www.nhgis.org  \n1980-2000\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey - https://data.census.gov/  \n2007-2021  \nForm C17002\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nThe U.S. Census Bureau defines a national poverty level (or household income) that varies by household size, number of children in a household, and age of householder. The national poverty level does not vary geographically even though cost of living is different across the United States. For the Bay Area, where cost of living is high and incomes are correspondingly high, an appropriate poverty level is 200% of poverty or twice the national poverty level, consistent with what was used for past equity work at MTC and ABAG. For comparison, however, both the national and 200% poverty levels are presented. \n\nFor Vital Signs, the poverty rate is defined as the number of people (including children) living below twice the poverty level divided by the number of people for whom poverty status is determined. The household income definitions for poverty change each year to reflect inflation. The official poverty definition uses money income before taxes and does not include capital gains or non-cash benefits (such as public housing, Medicaid and food stamps). \n\nFor the national poverty level definitions by year, see: US Census Bureau Poverty Thresholds - https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html.\n\nFor an explanation on how the Census Bureau measures poverty, see: How the Census Bureau Measures Poverty - https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/poverty/guidance/poverty-measures.html.\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS) 1-year data is used for larger geographies \u2013 Bay counties and most metropolitan area counties \u2013 while smaller geographies rely upon 5-year rolling average data due to their smaller sample sizes. Note that 2020 data uses the 5-year estimates because the ACS did not collect 1-year data for 2020.\n\nTo be consistent across metropolitan areas, the poverty definition for non-Bay Area metros is twice the national poverty level.

Note that 2020 data uses the 5-year estimates because the ACS did not collect 1-year data for 2020.\n\nQuintile income for 1970-2000 is imputed from decennial Census data using methodology from the California Department of Finance. Bay Area income is the population weighted average of county-level income.\n\nIncome has been inflated using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for 2021 specific to each metro area; however, some metro areas lack metro-specific CPI data back to 1970 and therefore adjusted data uses national CPI for 1970. Note that current MSA boundaries were used for historical comparison by identifying counties included in today\u2019s metro areas.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-20T17:25:43.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-06-07T23:26:14.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-20T17:25:43.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-01T00:30:09.000Z", "columns_name": ["80_Percentile_HH_Inc_PlaceOfResidence_IA_PerChg1970", "20_Percentile_HH_Inc_PlaceOfResidence_IA", "20_Percentile_HH_Inc_PlaceOfResidence_IA_PerChg1970", "40_Percentile_HH_Inc_PlaceOfResidence_IA", "60_Percentile_HH_Inc_PlaceOfResidence_IA", "80_Percentile_HH_Inc_PlaceOfResidence_IA", "Region", "Source", "40_Percentile_HH_Inc_PlaceOfResidence_IA_PerChg1970", "60_Percentile_HH_Inc_PlaceOfResidence_IA_PerChg1970", "Year"], "columns_field_name": ["_80_percentile_hh_inc_placeofresidence_ia_perchg1970", "_20_percentile_hh_inc_placeofresidence_ia", "_20_percentile_hh_inc_placeofresidence_ia_perchg1970", "_40_percentile_hh_inc_placeofresidence_ia", "_60_percentile_hh_inc_placeofresidence_ia", "_80_percentile_hh_inc_placeofresidence_ia", "region", "source", "_40_percentile_hh_inc_placeofresidence_ia_perchg1970", "_60_percentile_hh_inc_placeofresidence_ia_perchg1970", "year"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-06-07T23:26:16.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/qid2-ri63", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Income-Quintile-by-Place-of-Residence-/qid2-ri63", "owner": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}, "creator": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}}

The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, mode and operator tables for per-capita annual boardings (for an average resident in the given region or service area).\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE\r\nFederal Transit Administration: National Transit Database\r\nhttp://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION\r\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\r\nParatransit data is sparse in early years of the NTD dataset, meaning that transit ridership estimates in the early 1990s are likely underestimated. Simple modes were aggregated to combine the various bus modes (e.g. rapid bus, express bus, local bus) into a single mode to avoid incorrect conclusions resulting from mode recoding over the lifespan of NTD. \r\n\r\n2016 data should be considered preliminary, as it is derived from the monthly data tables rather than the longer-term time-series dataset. The unlinked passenger trips recorded in NTD's Monthly Module Adjusted Data Release database is used to calculate 2016 year-over-year change in ridership. The calculated 2016 growth rate is applied to the 2015 annual unlinked passenger trips recorded in the TS2.1 - Service Dta and Operating Expenses Time-Series by Mode to estimate 2016 ridership numbers. 2016 ridership estimates were not made for small operators that did not report monthly ridership numbers. For the Bay Area, this means 2016 ridership estimates are unavailable for Union City Transit (UCT) and Vacaville City Coach. Due to the omission of some small operators from 2016 estimates, regional and metro ridership numbers are likely slightly underestimated. Weekday ridership is calculated by taking the total annual ridership and dividing by 300, an assumption which is consistent with MTC travel modeling procedures; it was also compared to observed weekday boarding data (which is more limited in availability) to ensure consistency on the regional level. Per-capita transit ridership is calculated for the operator's general service area or taxation district; for example, BART includes the three core counties (San Francisco, Alameda, and Contra Costa) as well as northern San Mateo County post-SFO extension and AC Transit includes the cities located within its service area. ACE per-capita transit ridership is calculated using the population of Alameda and San Joaquin counties. For other metro areas, operators were identified by developing a list of all urbanized areas within a current MSA boundary and then using that UZA list to flag relevant operators; this means that all operators (both large and small) were included in the metro comparison data.", "attribution": "Federal Transit Administration: National Transit Database", "attribution_link": "http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2018-07-06T18:04:40.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-05-24T19:43:14.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-07-06T18:04:40.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-06-05T21:14:14.000Z", "columns_name": ["Population", "PerCapita_Annual_Boardings", "Source1", "Source3", "Source2", "Annual_Boardings", "Year", "Mode", "Region"], "columns_field_name": ["population", "percapita_annual_boardings", "source1", "source3", "source2", "annual_boardings", "year", "mode", "region"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "Annual transit boardings per-capita (per resident of service area)", "", "", "", "Annual passenger boardings", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "0", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "1", "align": "right"}, {}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "0", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-06-05T22:23:05.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["transportation", "health", "economy"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/qk3c-853m", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Transit-Ridership-per-Capita-By-Mode-b/qk3c-853m", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

Migration captures both voluntary relocation \u2013 for example, moving to another region for a better job or lower home prices \u2013 and involuntary relocation as a result of displacement. The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, and county tables. \n\nDATA SOURCE\nAmerican Community Survey County-to-County Migration Flows\n2012-2015\n5-year rolling average\nhttp://www.census.gov/topics/population/migration/data/tables.All.html\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nData for migration comes from the American Community Survey; county-to-county flow datasets experience a longer lag time than other standard datasets available in FactFinder. 5-year rolling average data was used for migration for all geographies, as the Census Bureau does not release 1-year annual data. Data is not available at any geography below the county level; note that flows that are relatively small on the county level are often within the margin of error. The metropolitan area comparison was performed for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area, in addition to the primary MSAs for the nine other major metropolitan areas, by aggregating county data based on current metropolitan area boundaries. Data prior to 2011 is not available on Vital Signs due to inconsistent Census formats and a lack of net migration statistics for prior years. Only counties with a non-negligible flow are shown in the data; all other pairs can be assumed to have zero migration.\n\nGiven that the vast majority of migration out of the region was to other counties in California, California counties were bundled into the following regions for simplicity:\nBay Area: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, Sonoma\nCentral Coast: Monterey, San Benito, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz\nCentral Valley: Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced, Tulare\nLos Angeles + Inland Empire: Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura\nSacramento: El Dorado, Placer, Sacramento, Sutter, Yolo, Yuba\nSan Diego: San Diego\nSan Joaquin Valley: San Joaquin, Stanislaus\nRural: all other counties (23)\n\nOne key limitation of the American Community Survey migration data is that it is not able to track emigration (movement of current U.S. residents to other countries). This is despite the fact that it is able to quantify immigration (movement of foreign residents to the U.S.), generally by continent of origin. Thus the Vital Signs analysis focuses primarily on net domestic migration, while still specifically citing in-migration flows from countries abroad based on data availability.", "attribution": "U.S. Census Bureau", "attribution_link": "http://api.census.gov", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-10-25T20:39:49.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-12-12T01:08:05.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-10-25T20:39:49.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2018-12-12T01:10:32.000Z", "columns_name": ["Inflow", "OD_CaliforniaSubregion", "Source", "Net_Migration", "Year", "Outflow", "OD_ForeignRegion", "County", "OD_State"], "columns_field_name": ["inflow", "od_californiasubregion", "source", "net_migration", "year", "outflow", "od_foreignregion", "county", "od_state"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Number of people moving from OD geography", "Subregion of origin and destination", "Data source", "Inflow minus outflow", "Year", "Number of people moving to the OD geography", "Other country of origin and destination (All Other Countries)", "County", "State of origin and destination (California or All Other States)"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-12-12T01:10:32.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "health", "infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/qmud-33nk", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Migration-by-county-simple-/qmud-33nk", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

Vehicle condition (both for revenue and non-revenue vehicles) is measured by the vehicle\u2019s age relative to its specified useful life.

Useful Life Benchmarks represent the estimated number of years that a vehicle can be in service and still be in a state of good repair, weighing the cost of maintenance against the cost of replacement. ULBs range from 8 years for automobiles and vans to 42 years for ferry boats. \n\nCondition of guideway, or rail tracks, is defined as the percentage of directional route-miles with performance restrictions observed at 9:00AM on the first Wednesday of each month. Performance restrictions are defined as a speed limit on a segment of fixed guideway that is below the guideway\u2019s design speed, and can result from a number of causes, including defects, signaling issues, or obstruction due to construction or maintenance activities.\n\nCondition of facilities is evaluated based on a five point condition rating scale developed by the FTA, known as Transit Economic Requirements Model (TERM). Facilities with a condition rating of one or two are deemed to be out of a state of good repair. Facilities are evaluated based on a minimum of 10 criteria, including electrical systems, plumbing, interiors, and exteriors.

Total delay, a companion measure, includes both congested delay and all other delay in which speeds are below the posted speed limit.\nDATA SOURCE\nMetropolitan Transportation Commission: Historical Congestion Analysis\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nDelay statistics only include freeway facilities and rely upon INRIX traffic data. They reflect delay on a typical weekday, which is defined as Tuesday through Thursday during peak traffic months. Delay statistics emphasize recurring delay - i.e. consistent delay greater than 15 minutes on a specific freeway segment. Congested delay is defined as congestion occurring with speeds less than 35 mph and is commonly recognized as inefficient delay (meaning that the freeway corridor is operating at speeds low enough to reduce throughput - as opposed to speeds greater than 35 mph which increase throughput). Data sources listed above were used to calculate per-capita and per-worker statistics; national datasets were used for metro comparisons and California datasets were used for the Bay Area. Top congested corridors are ranked by total vehicle hours of delay, meaning that the highlighted corridors reflect a combination of slow speeds and heavy traffic volumes. Historical Bay Area data was estimated by MTC Operations staff using a combination of internal datasets to develop an approximate trend back to 1998. The metropolitan area comparison was performed for the combined primary urbanized areas (San Francisco-Oakland and San Jose) as well as nine other major metropolitan areas' core urbanized area. Because the Texas Transportation Institute no longer reports congested freeway delay or total freeway delay (focusing solely on total regional delay), 2011 data was used to estimate 2014 total freeway delay for each metro area by relying upon the freeway-to-regional ratio from 2011.

While \u201cat risk\u201d households may not necessarily be displaced in the short-term or long-term, neighborhoods identified as being \u201cat risk\u201d signify pressure as reflected by the decline in lower-income households (who are presumed to relocate to other more affordable communities). The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, county and census tract tables. \n\nDATA SOURCE\nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census\n1980-1990\nForm STF3\nhttps://nhgis.org\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census\n2000\nForm SF3a\nhttps://nhgis.org\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census\n1980-2010\nLongitudinal Tract Database\nhttp://www.s4.brown.edu/us2010/index.htm\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey\n2010-2015\nForm S1901\n5-year rolling average\nhttp://factfinder2.census.gov\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey\n2010-2017\nForm B19013\n5-year rolling average\nhttp://factfinder2.census.gov\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nAligning with the approach used for Plan Bay Area 2040, displacement risk is calculated by comparing the analysis year with the most recent year prior to identify census tracts that are losing lower-income households. Historical data is pulled from U.S. Census datasets and aligned with today\u2019s census tract boundaries using crosswalk tables provided by LTDB. Tract data, as well as regional income data, are calculated using 5-year rolling averages for consistency \u2013 given that tract data is only available on a 5-year basis. Using household tables by income level, the number of households in each tract falling below the median are summed, which involves summing all brackets below the regional median and then summing a fractional share of the bracket that includes the regional median (assuming a simple linear distribution within that bracket).\n\nOnce all tracts in a given county or metro area are synced to today\u2019s boundaries, the analysis identifies census tracts of greater than 500 lower-income people (in the prior year) to filter out low-population areas. For those tracts, any net loss between the prior year and the analysis year results in that tract being flagged as being at risk of displacement, and all lower-income households in that tract are flagged. To calculate the share of households at risk, the number of lower-income households living in flagged tracts are summed and divided by the total number of lower-income households living in the larger geography (county or metro). Minor deviations on a year-to-year basis should be taken in context, given that data on the tract level often fluctuates and has a significant margin of error; changes on the county and regional level are more appropriate to consider on an annual basis instead.", "attribution": "U.S. Census Bureau", "attribution_link": "http://api.census.gov", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-08-13T16:05:43.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-12-12T22:32:06.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-08-13T16:05:43.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2018-12-12T22:35:13.000Z", "columns_name": ["Source1", "County", "Displacement_Risk", "Source3", "Tract", "Year", "LIHH_At_Risk", "ID2", "LIHH_Total", "Source2", "ID"], "columns_field_name": ["source1", "county", "displacement_risk", "source3", "tract", "year", "lihh_at_risk", "id2", "lihh_total", "source2", "id"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "Share of lower income households at risk of displacement", "", "", "", "Number of lower-income households at risk of displacement", "", "Total number of lower-income households", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-12-12T22:35:13.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "infrastructure", "environment"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/r2zc-q9se", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Displacement-Risk-by-tract/r2zc-q9se", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) is a smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure of the typical home value and market changes across a given region and housing type. It reflects the typical value for homes in the 35th to 65th percentile range. ZHVI is computed from public record transaction data as reported by counties. All standard real estate transactions are included in this metric, including REO sales and auctions. Zillow makes a substantial effort to remove transactions not typically considered a standard sale. Examples of these include bank takeovers of foreclosed properties, title transfers after a death or divorce and non arms-length transactions. Zillow defines all homes as single-family residential, condominium and co-operative homes with a county record. Single-family residences are detached, which means the home is an individual structure with its own lot. Condominiums are units that can be owned in a multi-unit complex, such as an apartment building. Co-operative homes are slightly different from condominiums in that the homeowners own shares in the corporation that owns the building, not the actual units themselves.\n\nFor metropolitan area comparison values, the Bay Area metro area\u2019s median home sale price is the population-weighted average of the nine counties\u2019 median home prices. Data is adjusted for inflation using Bureau of Labor Statistics metropolitan statistical area (MSA)-specific series. Inflation-adjusted data are presented to illustrate how home prices have grown relative to overall price increases; that said, the use of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) does create some challenges given the fact that housing represents a major chunk of consumer goods bundle used to calculate CPI.

While \"at risk\" households may not necessarily be displaced in the short-term or long-term, neighborhoods identified as being \"at risk\" signify pressure as reflected by the decline in lower-income households (who are presumed to relocate to other more affordable communities). The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, county and census tract tables. \n\nDATA SOURCE  \nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census - https://nhgis.org  \nForm STF3 (1990-2000)\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey (5-year rolling average) - https://data.census.gov/  \n2009-2021  \nForm B19001, B19013\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nAligning with the approach used for Plan Bay Area 2040, displacement risk is calculated by comparing the analysis year with the most recent year prior to identify census tracts that are losing lower-income households. Tract data, as well as regional income data, are calculated using 5-year rolling averages for consistency \u2013 given that tract data is only available on a 5-year basis. Using household tables by income level, the number of households in each tract falling below the median are summed, which involves summing all brackets below the regional median and then summing a fractional share of the bracket that includes the regional median (assuming a uniform distribution within that bracket).\n\nOnce all tracts in a given county or metro area are synced to today\u2019s boundaries, the analysis identifies census tracts of greater than 500 lower-income people (in the prior year) to filter out low-population areas. For those tracts, any net loss between the prior year and the analysis year results in that tract being flagged as being at risk of displacement, and all lower-income households in that tract are flagged. To calculate the share of households at risk, the number of lower-income households living in flagged tracts are summed and divided by the total number of lower-income households living in the larger geography (county or metro). Minor deviations on a year-to-year basis should be taken in context, given that data on the tract level often fluctuates and has a significant margin of error; changes on the county and regional level are more appropriate to consider on an annual basis instead.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-27T22:45:09.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-08-02T00:39:30.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-27T22:45:09.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-01-03T18:37:54.000Z", "columns_name": ["ID", "LIHH_At_Risk", "LIHH_Total", "Source3", "Source1", "County", "Tract", "Displacement_Risk", "Year", "Source2"], "columns_field_name": ["id", "lihh_at_risk", "lihh_total", "source3", "source1", "county", "tract", "displacement_risk", "year", "source2"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-08-02T00:42:40.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/r6hf-y7m3", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Displacement-Risk-by-tract-2022-/r6hf-y7m3", "owner": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}, "creator": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}}

While a significant share of residents may choose to rent, home prices represent a primary driver of housing affordability in a given region, county or city.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nZillow: Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) - http://www.zillow.com/research/data/  \n2000-2021\n\nCalifornia Department of Finance: E-4 Historical Population Estimates for Cities, Counties, and the State - https://dof.ca.gov/forecasting/demographics/estimates/  \n2000-2021\n\nUS Census Population and Housing Unit Estimates - https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest.html  \n2000-2021\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics: Consumer Price Index - http://data.bls.gov  \n2000-2021\n\nUS Census ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) - https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html  \n2020 Census Blocks\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nHousing price estimates at the regional-, county-, city- and zip code-level come from analysis of individual home sales by Zillow based upon transaction records. Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) is a smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure of the typical home value and market changes across a given region and housing type. It reflects the typical value for homes in the 35th to 65th percentile range. ZHVI is computed from public record transaction data as reported by counties. All standard real estate transactions are included in this metric, including REO sales and auctions. Zillow makes a substantial effort to remove transactions not typically considered a standard sale. Examples of these include bank takeovers of foreclosed properties, title transfers after a death or divorce and non arms-length transactions. Zillow defines all homes as single-family residential, condominium and co-operative homes with a county record. Single-family residences are detached, which means the home is an individual structure with its own lot. Condominiums are units that can be owned in a multi-unit complex, such as an apartment building. Co-operative homes are slightly different from condominiums in that the homeowners own shares in the corporation that owns the building, not the actual units themselves.\n\nFor metropolitan area comparison values, the Bay Area metro area\u2019s median home sale price is the population-weighted average of the nine counties\u2019 median home prices. Data is adjusted for inflation using Bureau of Labor Statistics metropolitan statistical area (MSA)-specific series. Inflation-adjusted data are presented to illustrate how home prices have grown relative to overall price increases; that said, the use of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) does create some challenges given the fact that housing represents a major chunk of consumer goods bundle used to calculate CPI. This reflects a methodological tradeoff between precision and accuracy and is a common concern when working with any commodity that is a major component of the CPI itself.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-20T01:10:10.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-07-21T18:21:00.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-20T01:10:10.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-12-02T17:11:39.000Z", "columns_name": ["Percentchngpriceia", "Medprice_Ia", "Month", "Year", "Objectid", "Medprice", "Percentchngprice", "Metro", "Msa", "Source"], "columns_field_name": ["percentchngpriceia", "medprice_ia", "month", "year", "objectid", "medprice", "percentchngprice", "metro", "msa", "source"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Percent Change Since 2000  (2021 dollars)", "Zillow Home Value Zestimate (2021 dollars)", "Month", "Year", "objectid", "Zillow Home Value Zestimate", "Percent Change Since 2000", "Metro", "Metro Area", "Source"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-07-21T18:21:04.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Economy", "domain_tags": ["ec7", "vital signs", "vital signs 2.0"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/rgc5-3kcq", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/Economy/Vital-Signs-Home-Prices-by-Metro-Area-2022-/rgc5-3kcq", "owner": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}, "creator": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}}

The footprint is defined as land occupied by structures, with a building density of at least 1 unit to 1.5 acres.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nDepartment of Conservation: Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program\nGIS Data Tables/Layers (1990-2016)\nhttps://www.conservation.ca.gov/dlrp/fmmp\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census\nPopulation by Census Block Group (2000-2010)\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey (5-year)\nPopulation by Census Block Group (2000-2017)\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nFor regional and local data, FMMP maps the extent of \u201curban and built-up\u201d lands, which generally reflect the developed urban footprint of the region. The footprint is defined as land occupied by structures with building density of at least 1 unit to 1.5 acres. Uses include residential, industrial, commercial, construction, institutional, public administration, railroad and other transportation yards, cemeteries, airports, golf courses, sanitary landfills, sewage treatment, water control structures, and other developed purposes.\n\nTo determine the amount of greenfield development (in acres) occurring in a given two-year period, the differences in urban footprint are computed on a county-level. FMMP makes slight refinements to urban boundaries over time, so changes in urban footprint +/- 100 acres are not regionally significant. The GIS shapefile represents the 2016 urban footprint and thus does not show previously urbanized land outside of the footprint (i.e. Hamilton Air Force Base).\n\nFor metro comparisons, a different methodology had to be used to avoid the geospatial limitations associated with FMMP. U.S. Census population by census block group was gathered for each metro area for 2000, 2010, and 2017. Population data for years 2000 and 2010 come from the Decennial Census while data for 2018 comes from the 2017 5-year American Community Survey. The block group was considered urbanized if its average/gross density was greater than 1 housing unit per acre (a slightly higher threshold than FMMP uses for its definition). Because a block group cannot be flagged as partially urbanized, and non-residential uses are not fully captured, the urban footprint of the region calculated with this methodology is smaller than in FMMP. The metro data should be primarily used for looking at comparative growth rate in greenfield development rather than the acreage totals themselves.", "attribution": "Farmland Mapping & Monitoring Program", "attribution_link": "https://www.conservation.ca.gov/dlrp/fmmp", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2020-07-03T16:37:00.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-11-14T20:44:39.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-07-03T16:37:00.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-11-15T22:38:10.000Z", "columns_name": ["Percent_Biannual_Urban_Acres_Growth", "Biannual_Urban_Acres_Growth", "Year", "Percent_Change_Urban_Acres_Since_1990", "Source", "Region", "Urban_Acres"], "columns_field_name": ["percent_biannual_urban_acres", "biannual_urban_acres_growth", "year", "percent_change_urban_acres", "source", "region", "urban_acres"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Percent change in urbanized acres over the past two years", "Net change in urbanized acres in previous two years", "", "Percent change in urbanized acres since 1990", "", "", "Number of urbanized acres"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-11-14T20:47:24.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "environment", "infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/rip6-kpmp", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Greenfield-Development-Bay-Area/rip6-kpmp", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

Estimates for sub-county areas are the sums of city-level estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey (ACS) 2010-2017.\n\nThe following incorporated cities and towns are included in each sub-county area:\nNorth Alameda County \u2013 Alameda, Albany, Berkeley, Emeryville, Oakland, Piedmont\nEast Alameda County - Dublin, Livermore, Pleasanton\nSouth Alameda County - Fremont, Hayward, Newark, San Leandro, Union City\nCentral Contra Costa County - Clayton, Concord, Danville, Lafayette, Martinez, Moraga, Orinda, Pleasant Hill, San Ramon, Walnut Creek\nEast Contra Costa County - Antioch, Brentwood, Oakley, Pittsburg\nWest Contra Costa County - El Cerrito, Hercules, Pinole, Richmond, San Pablo\nMarin \u2013 all incorporated cities and towns\nNapa \u2013 all incorporated cities and towns\nSan Francisco \u2013 San Francisco\nNorth San Mateo - Brisbane, Colma, Daly City, Millbrae, Pacifica, San Bruno, South San Francisco\nCentral San Mateo - Belmont, Burlingame, Foster City, Half Moon Bay, Hillsborough, San Carlos, San Mateo\nSouth San Mateo - East Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Portola Valley, Redwood City, Woodside\nNorth Santa Clara - Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Milpitas, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Santa Clara, Sunnyvale\nSan Jose \u2013 San Jose\nSouthwest Santa Clara - Campbell, Cupertino, Los Gatos, Monte Sereno, Saratoga\nSouth Santa Clara - Gilroy, Morgan Hill\nEast Solano - Dixon, Fairfield, Rio Vista, Suisun City, Vacaville\nSouth Solano - Benicia, Vallejo\nNorth Sonoma - Cloverdale, Healdsburg, Windsor\nSouth Sonoma - Cotati, Petaluma, Rohnert Park, Santa Rosa, Sebastopol, Sonoma", "attribution": "California Employment Development Department: Current Employment Statistics", "attribution_link": "http://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov/", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2020-04-13T23:21:14.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-10-05T00:49:02.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-04-13T23:21:14.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-10-05T03:58:57.000Z", "columns_name": ["Year", "Region", "Source", "Jobs", "PercentChng_1990"], "columns_field_name": ["year", "region", "source", "jobs", "percentchng_1990"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "Number of workers in a given geography by year", "Percent change in number of workers since 1990"], "columns_format": [{"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-10-05T03:58:58.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["economy", "demographics", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/rtdm-ybjw", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Jobs-Bay-Area/rtdm-ybjw", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

Covered employees in the private-sector and in the state and local government include most corporate officials, all executives, all supervisory personnel, all professionals, all clerical workers, many farmworkers, all wage earners, all piece workers and all part-time workers. Workers on paid sick leave, paid holiday, paid vacation and the like are also covered.\n\nBesides excluding the aforementioned national security agencies, QCEW excludes proprietors, the unincorporated self-employed, unpaid family members, certain farm and domestic workers exempted from having to report employment data and railroad workers covered by the railroad unemployment insurance system. Excluded as well are workers who earned no wages during the entire applicable pay period because of work stoppages, temporary layoffs, illness or unpaid vacations. \n\nFor measuring jobs below the county level, Vital Signs assigns collections of incorporated cities and towns to sub-county areas. For example, the cities of East Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Portola Valley, Redwood City and Woodside are considered South San Mateo County. Because Bay Area counties differ in footprint, the number of cities included in a sub-county is one for San Francisco and San Jose and more than one for all other sub-counties.

American Community Survey 1-year data is used for larger geographies \u2013 metropolitan areas and counties \u2013 while smaller geographies rely upon 5-year rolling average data due to their smaller sample sizes. Quintile income for 1970-2000 is imputed from Decennial Census data using methodology from the California Department of Finance (for more information, go to: http://www.dof.ca.gov/Forecasting/Demographics/Census_Data_Center_Network/documents/How_to_Recalculate_a_Median.pdf). Bay Area income is the population weighted average of county-level income.\n\nIncome has been inflated using the Consumer Price Index specific to each metro area; however, some metro areas lack metro-specific CPI data back to 1970 and therefore adjusted data is unavailable for some historical data points.

Useful Life Benchmarks represent the estimated number of years that a vehicle can be in service and still be in a state of good repair, weighing the cost of maintenance against the cost of replacement. ULBs range from 8 years for automobiles and vans to 42 years for ferry boats.  \n\nCondition of guideway, or rail tracks, is defined as the percentage of directional route-miles with performance restrictions observed at 9:00AM on the first Wednesday of each month. Performance restrictions are defined as a speed limit on a segment of fixed guideway that is below the guideway\u2019s design speed, and can result from a number of causes, including defects, signaling issues, or obstruction due to construction or maintenance activities.\n\nCondition of facilities is evaluated based on a five point condition rating scale developed by the FTA, known as Transit Economic Requirements Model (TERM). Facilities with a condition rating of one or two are deemed to be out of a state of good repair. Facilities are evaluated based on a minimum of 10 criteria, including electrical systems, plumbing, interiors, and exteriors. Facility condition is weighted by assessed monetary value of the asset. \n\nMore information on federal performance measures for transit asset condition can be found on the FTA website. https://www.transit.dot.gov/TAM", "attribution": "Metropolitan Transportation Commission: RTCI", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-10-25T20:35:00.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-09-04T18:37:06.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-10-25T20:35:00.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2018-09-28T19:03:56.000Z", "columns_name": ["Share_Not_in_SGR", "System", "Year", "Source", "NTD_ID", "AssetType", "Number_Not_in_SGR", "Number_in_SGR"], "columns_field_name": ["share_not_in_sgr", "system", "year", "source", "ntd_id", "assettype", "number_not_in_sgr", "number_in_sgr"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Percent of assets considered not in a state of good repair by asset type.

Given that there are varying forecasts for the heightened high tides (i.e., mean highest high water mark), projected sea level impacts are presented for six scenarios ranging from a one foot rise to six feet. A neighborhood is considered vulnerable to sea level rise when at least 10 percent of its land area is forecasted to be inundated by peak high tides in the coming years. The dataset includes at-risk population and population share data for the region, counties, and neighborhoods.\n\nDATA SOURCE \nSan Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission \n2017 \nSea Level Rise Maps\nhttp://www.adaptingtorisingtides.org/project/regional-sea-level-rise-mapping-and-shoreline-analysis/\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION \nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator) \nProjected areas of inundation were developed by BCDC and NOAA at one-foot intervals ranging from one foot to four feet of sea level rise. Regional and local sea level rise analysis is based on data from BCDC\u2019s ART (Adapting to Rising Tides) Bay Area Sea Level Rise and Mapping Project. This data reflects the most up-to-date and detailed sea level rise mapping for the Bay Area. Sea level rise analysis for metro areas is based on national sea level rise mapping from NOAA, which is best for metro-to-metro comparison. To determine the impacts on historical and current populations, inundation areas were overlaid on a U.S. Census shapefile of 2010 Census tracts using Census Bureau population data. \n\nBecause census tracts can extend beyond the coastline, the baseline scenario of zero feet was used to determine existing sea level coverage of census tracts. Sea level rise refers to the change from this level. The area of the tract was determined by measuring the component of the tract area not currently under water. This area, rather than the total tract area, was used as the denominator to determine the percentage of the census tract that is inundated under future sea level rise projection scenarios. When at least 10 percent of tract land area is inundated with a given sea level, its residents are considered to be affected by sea level rise.\n\nFor the purpose of this analysis, SLR scenarios were assumed not to reflect periodic inundation due to extreme weather events, which may lead to an even greater share of residents affected on a less frequent basis. Prior to the impacts from sea level rise, neighborhoods will experience temporary flooding from extreme weather events which can create significant damage to homes and neighborhoods. It should be noted that by directly reviewing maps and tools through the ART (Adapting to Rising Tides) program, regular inundation sea level rise and temporary flooding from extreme weather events are both available. More information on this approach is available here: http://www.adaptingtorisingtides.org/project/regional-sea-level-rise-mapping-and-shoreline-analysis/\n\nSea level rise analysis for metro areas reflects local, as opposed to global, sea level rise. Recent data has shown sea level is rising faster in the southeast region of the United States. Regional differences in the rate of sea level rise.

To allow for historical comparisons, the Census Bureau merges housing expenditure brackets into three consistent bins (less than 20 percent, 20 percent to 34 percent, and more than 35 percent) that work for all years. The highest income bracket for renters in the ACS data was \\$100,000 or more, while the homeowner dataset included brackets for \\$100,000 to \\$149,999 and \\$150,000 and above. These brackets were merged together to allow for uniform comparison across tenure. While some studies use 30 percent as the affordability threshold, Vital Signs uses 35 percent as this is the closest break point using the standardized affordability brackets above.\n\nACS 1-year data is used for larger geographies \u2013 Bay counties and most metropolitan area counties \u2013 while smaller geographies rely upon 5-year rolling average data due to their smaller sample sizes. Note that 2020 data uses the 5-year estimates because the ACS did not collect 1-year data for 2020.\n\nIncome breakdown data is only provided for one year as it is not possible to compare consistent inflation-adjusted income brackets over time given Census data limitations.

{"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Migration - Bay Area", "id": "sgrm-yup2", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nMigration (EQ4)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nMigration flows\n\nLAST UPDATED\nDecember 2018\n\nDESCRIPTION\nMigration refers to the movement of people from one location to another, typically crossing a county or regional boundary. Migration captures both voluntary relocation \u2013 for example, moving to another region for a better job or lower home prices \u2013 and involuntary relocation as a result of displacement. The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, and county tables. \n\nDATA SOURCE\nAmerican Community Survey County-to-County Migration Flows\n2012-2015\n5-year rolling average\nhttp://www.census.gov/topics/population/migration/data/tables.All.html\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nData for migration comes from the American Community Survey; county-to-county flow datasets experience a longer lag time than other standard datasets available in FactFinder. 5-year rolling average data was used for migration for all geographies, as the Census Bureau does not release 1-year annual data. Data is not available at any geography below the county level; note that flows that are relatively small on the county level are often within the margin of error. The metropolitan area comparison was performed for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area, in addition to the primary MSAs for the nine other major metropolitan areas, by aggregating county data based on current metropolitan area boundaries. Data prior to 2011 is not available on Vital Signs due to inconsistent Census formats and a lack of net migration statistics for prior years. Only counties with a non-negligible flow are shown in the data; all other pairs can be assumed to have zero migration.\n\nGiven that the vast majority of migration out of the region was to other counties in California, California counties were bundled into the following regions for simplicity:\nBay Area: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, Sonoma\nCentral Coast: Monterey, San Benito, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz\nCentral Valley: Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced, Tulare\nLos Angeles + Inland Empire: Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura\nSacramento: El Dorado, Placer, Sacramento, Sutter, Yolo, Yuba\nSan Diego: San Diego\nSan Joaquin Valley: San Joaquin, Stanislaus\nRural: all other counties (23)\n\nOne key limitation of the American Community Survey migration data is that it is not able to track emigration (movement of current U.S. residents to other countries). This is despite the fact that it is able to quantify immigration (movement of foreign residents to the U.S.), generally by continent of origin. Thus the Vital Signs analysis focuses primarily on net domestic migration, while still specifically citing in-migration flows from countries abroad based on data availability.", "attribution": "U.S. Census Bureau", "attribution_link": "http://api.census.gov", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-10-25T20:40:04.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-12-12T01:00:32.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-10-25T20:40:04.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2018-12-12T01:04:15.000Z", "columns_name": ["Inflow", "OD_CaliforniaSubregion", "Outflow", "Year", "OD_State", "Net_Migration", "Region", "Source", "OD_ForeignRegion"], "columns_field_name": ["inflow", "od_californiasubregion", "outflow", "year", "od_state", "net_migration", "region", "source", "od_foreignregion"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Number of residents moving from OD geography to Bay Area", "California subregion of origin and destination", "Number of residents moving from Bay Area to OD geography", "Year", "State of origin and destination (CA or All Other States)", "Inflow minus outflow", "Region", "Data source", "Other country of origin and destination (All Other Countries)"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-12-12T01:04:15.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "health", "infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/sgrm-yup2", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Migration-Bay-Area/sgrm-yup2", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

{"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Migration - by county (detailed)", "id": "sne6-igb4", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nMigration (EQ4)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nMigration flows\n\nLAST UPDATED\nDecember 2018\n\nDESCRIPTION\nMigration refers to the movement of people from one location to another, typically crossing a county or regional boundary. Migration captures both voluntary relocation \u2013 for example, moving to another region for a better job or lower home prices \u2013 and involuntary relocation as a result of displacement. The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, and county tables. \n\nDATA SOURCE\nAmerican Community Survey County-to-County Migration Flows\n2012-2015\n5-year rolling average\nhttp://www.census.gov/topics/population/migration/data/tables.All.html\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nData for migration comes from the American Community Survey; county-to-county flow datasets experience a longer lag time than other standard datasets available in FactFinder. 5-year rolling average data was used for migration for all geographies, as the Census Bureau does not release 1-year annual data. Data is not available at any geography below the county level; note that flows that are relatively small on the county level are often within the margin of error. The metropolitan area comparison was performed for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area, in addition to the primary MSAs for the nine other major metropolitan areas, by aggregating county data based on current metropolitan area boundaries. Data prior to 2011 is not available on Vital Signs due to inconsistent Census formats and a lack of net migration statistics for prior years. Only counties with a non-negligible flow are shown in the data; all other pairs can be assumed to have zero migration.\n\nGiven that the vast majority of migration out of the region was to other counties in California, California counties were bundled into the following regions for simplicity:\nBay Area: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, Sonoma\nCentral Coast: Monterey, San Benito, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz\nCentral Valley: Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced, Tulare\nLos Angeles + Inland Empire: Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura\nSacramento: El Dorado, Placer, Sacramento, Sutter, Yolo, Yuba\nSan Diego: San Diego\nSan Joaquin Valley: San Joaquin, Stanislaus\nRural: all other counties (23)\n\nOne key limitation of the American Community Survey migration data is that it is not able to track emigration (movement of current U.S. residents to other countries). This is despite the fact that it is able to quantify immigration (movement of foreign residents to the U.S.), generally by continent of origin. Thus the Vital Signs analysis focuses primarily on net domestic migration, while still specifically citing in-migration flows from countries abroad based on data availability.", "attribution": "U.S. Census Bureau", "attribution_link": "http://api.census.gov", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-10-25T20:39:24.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-12-12T01:11:49.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-10-25T20:39:24.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2018-12-12T01:16:26.000Z", "columns_name": ["County", "Net_Migration", "OD_County", "OD_ForeignRegion", "OD_State", "Source", "Year", "Inflow", "Outflow"], "columns_field_name": ["county", "net_migration", "od_county", "od_foreignregion", "od_state", "source", "year", "inflow", "outflow"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["County", "Inflow minus outflow", "County of origin and destination", "Foreign region of origin (Africa, Asia, Caribbean, Central America, Europe, Northern America, Oceania and At Sea, South America, U.S. Island Areas)", "State of origin and destination", "Data source", "Year", "Number of people moving from OD geography", "Number of people moving to OD geography"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-12-12T01:16:27.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["health", "demographics", "infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/sne6-igb4", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Migration-by-county-detailed-/sne6-igb4", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

Total delay, a companion measure, includes both congested delay and all other delay in which speeds are below the posted speed limit.\nDATA SOURCE\nMetropolitan Transportation Commission: Historical Congestion Analysis\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nDelay statistics only include freeway facilities and rely upon INRIX traffic data. They reflect delay on a typical weekday, which is defined as Tuesday through Thursday during peak traffic months. Delay statistics emphasize recurring delay - i.e. consistent delay greater than 15 minutes on a specific freeway segment. Congested delay is defined as congestion occurring with speeds less than 35 mph and is commonly recognized as inefficient delay (meaning that the freeway corridor is operating at speeds low enough to reduce throughput - as opposed to speeds greater than 35 mph which increase throughput). Data sources listed above were used to calculate per-capita and per-worker statistics; national datasets were used for metro comparisons and California datasets were used for the Bay Area. Top congested corridors are ranked by total vehicle hours of delay, meaning that the highlighted corridors reflect a combination of slow speeds and heavy traffic volumes. Historical Bay Area data was estimated by MTC Operations staff using a combination of internal datasets to develop an approximate trend back to 1998. The metropolitan area comparison was performed for the combined primary urbanized areas (San Francisco-Oakland and San Jose) as well as nine other major metropolitan areas' core urbanized area. Because the Texas Transportation Institute no longer reports congested freeway delay or total freeway delay (focusing solely on total regional delay), 2011 data was used to estimate 2014 total freeway delay for each metro area by relying upon the freeway-to-regional ratio from 2011. Estimated urbanized area workers were used for this analysis using the 2011 ratios, which accounts for slight differentials between Bay Area data points under the regional historical data and the metro comparison analysis.

A Priority Development Area (PDA) is a locally-designated area with frequent transit service, where a jurisdiction has decided to concentrate most of its housing and jobs growth for development in the foreseeable future. PDA boundaries are current as of August 2019. For more information on PDA designation see http://gis.abag.ca.gov/website/PDAShowcase/.\n\nPopulation estimates for Bay Area counties and cities are from the California Department of Finance, which are as of January 1st of each year. Population estimates for non-Bay Area regions are from the U.S. Census Bureau. Decennial Census years reflect population as of April 1st of each year whereas population estimates for intercensal estimates are as of July 1st of each year. Population estimates for Bay Area tracts are from the decennial Census (1970 -2010) and the American Community Survey (2008-2012 5-year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average; 2013-2017 5-year rolling average). Estimates of population density for tracts use gross acres as the denominator.\n\nPopulation estimates for Bay Area PDAs are from the decennial Census (1970 - 2010) and the American Community Survey (2006-2010 5 year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average; 2013-2017 5-year rolling average). Population estimates for PDAs are derived from Census population counts at the tract level for 1970-1990 and at the block group level for 2000-2017. Population from either tracts or block groups are allocated to a PDA using an area ratio. For example, if a quarter of a Census block group lies with in a PDA, a quarter of its population will be allocated to that PDA. Tract-to-PDA and block group-to-PDA area ratios are calculated using gross acres. Estimates of population density for PDAs use gross acres as the denominator.\n\nAnnual population estimates for metropolitan areas outside the Bay Area are from the Census and are benchmarked to each decennial Census. The annual estimates in the 1990s were not updated to match the 2000 benchmark.\n\nThe following is a", "attribution": "California Department of Finance", "attribution_link": "http://www.dof.ca.gov/Forecasting/Demographics/Estimates/", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-10-16T18:54:42.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-10-16T18:53:02.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-10-16T18:54:42.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-10-16T18:54:42.000Z", "columns_name": ["PopShare", "Geography", "GeographicArea", "Year", "Pop", "Source"], "columns_field_name": ["popshare", "geography", "geographicarea", "year", "pop", "source"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Share of the population living in this geographic area", "", "Indicates the geographical area (Big Three; Bayside; Inland, Coastal and Delta; Unincorporated)", "", "Population", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-10-16T18:54:42.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "environment"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/sufg-ed7z", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Population-Bay-Area-shares-updated-Oct/sufg-ed7z", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

To allow for historical comparisons, the Census Bureau merges housing expenditure brackets into three consistent bins (less than 20 percent, 20 percent to 34 percent, and more than 35 percent) that work for all years. The highest income bracket for renters in the ACS data was $100,000 or more, while the homeowner dataset included brackets for $100,000 to $149,999 and $150,000 and above. These brackets were merged together to allow for uniform comparison across tenure. While some studies use 30 percent as the affordability threshold, Vital Signs uses 35 percent as this is the closest break point using the standardized affordability brackets above. Historical data for Napa County is unavailable due to an insufficient sample size for renters in a number of years, making it impossible to calculate affordability for all households. All ACS data is for a single year, rather than a rolling average.

The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, mode and operator tables for total typical weekday boardings.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nFederal Transit Administration: National Transit Database - http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm  \n1991-2022\n\nCalifornia Department of Finance: E-4 Historical Population Estimates for Cities, Counties, and the State - https://dof.ca.gov/forecasting/demographics/estimates/  \n1991-2022\n\nUS Census Population and Housing Unit Estimates - https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest.html  \n1991-2022\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nThe National Transit Database (NTD) dataset was lightly cleaned to correct for erroneous zero values - in which null values (unsubmitted data) were incorrectly marked as zeroes. Paratransit data is sparse in early years of the NTD dataset, meaning that transit ridership estimates in the early 1990s are likely underestimated. Simple modes were aggregated to combine the various bus modes (e.g. rapid bus, express bus, local bus) into a single mode to avoid incorrect conclusions resulting from mode recoding over the lifespan of NTD.\n\n2022 data should be considered preliminary, as it comes from the monthly data tables rather than the longer-term time series dataset. Weekday ridership is calculated by taking the total annual ridership and dividing by 300, an assumption which is consistent with MTC travel modeling procedures; it was also compared to observed weekday boarding data (which is more limited in availability) to ensure consistency on the regional level. Per-capita transit ridership is calculated for the operator's general service area or taxation district; for example, BART includes the three core counties (San Francisco, Alameda, and Contra Costa), as well as northern San Mateo County post-SFO extension, and AC Transit includes the cities located within its service area. For other metro areas, operators were identified by developing a list of all urbanized areas within a current MSA boundary and then using that UZA list to flag relevant operators; this means that all operators (both large and small) were included in the metro comparison data.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-13T17:54:57.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-06-29T19:52:17.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-13T17:54:57.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-10T22:59:05.000Z", "columns_name": ["Region", "Percentchg_1991", "Est_Weekday_Boardings", "Annual_Boardings", "Year", "Objectid", "Source"], "columns_field_name": ["region", "percentchg_1991", "est_weekday_boardings", "annual_boardings", "year", "objectid", "source"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Bay Area", "Ridership Change Since 1991", "Estimated Weekday Boardings", "Annual Boardings", "Year", "objectid", "Source"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-06-29T19:52:21.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Transportation", "domain_tags": ["t11t12", "vital signs", "vital signs 2.0"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/t2mj-tpzf", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/Transportation/Vital-Signs-Transit-Ridership-Bay-Area-2022-DRAFT/t2mj-tpzf", "owner": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}, "creator": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}}

The data was tabulated using provided categories specifying injury level, individuals involved, causes of collision, and location/jurisdiction of collision (for more: http://tims.berkeley.edu/help/files/switrs_codebook.doc). Fatalities were normalized over historic population data from the US Census and California Department of Finance and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) data from the Federal Highway Administration.\r\n\r\nFor more regarding reporting procedures and injury classification see the California Highway Patrol Manual

The footprint is defined as land occupied by structures, with a building density of at least 1 unit to 1.5 acres.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nDepartment of Conservation: Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program\nGIS Data Tables/Layers (1990-2016)\nhttps://www.conservation.ca.gov/dlrp/fmmp\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census\nPopulation by Census Block Group (2000-2010)\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey (5-year)\nPopulation by Census Block Group (2000-2017)\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nFor regional and local data, FMMP maps the extent of \u201curban and built-up\u201d lands, which generally reflect the developed urban footprint of the region. The footprint is defined as land occupied by structures with building density of at least 1 unit to 1.5 acres. Uses include residential, industrial, commercial, construction, institutional, public administration, railroad and other transportation yards, cemeteries, airports, golf courses, sanitary landfills, sewage treatment, water control structures, and other developed purposes.\n\nTo determine the amount of greenfield development (in acres) occurring in a given two-year period, the differences in urban footprint are computed on a county-level. FMMP makes slight refinements to urban boundaries over time, so changes in urban footprint +/- 100 acres are not regionally significant. The GIS shapefile represents the 2016 urban footprint and thus does not show previously urbanized land outside of the footprint (i.e. Hamilton Air Force Base).\n\nFor metro comparisons, a different methodology had to be used to avoid the geospatial limitations associated with FMMP. U.S. Census population by census block group was gathered for each metro area for 2000, 2010, and 2017. Population data for years 2000 and 2010 come from the Decennial Census while data for 2018 comes from the 2017 5-year American Community Survey. The block group was considered urbanized if its average/gross density was greater than 1 housing unit per acre (a slightly higher threshold than FMMP uses for its definition). Because a block group cannot be flagged as partially urbanized, and non-residential uses are not fully captured, the urban footprint of the region calculated with this methodology is smaller than in FMMP. The metro data should be primarily used for looking at comparative growth rate in greenfield development rather than the acreage totals themselves.", "attribution": "U.S. Census Bureau", "attribution_link": "https://www.factfinder.census.gov", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2020-07-03T16:36:42.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-11-14T20:41:15.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-07-03T16:36:42.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-11-14T20:44:01.000Z", "columns_name": ["Percent_Change_Urban_Acres_2000", "NonUrban_Acres", "Urban_Acres", "Change_Urban_Acres_2000", "Year", "Metro", "Source", "Total_Acres"], "columns_field_name": ["percent_change_urban_acres_2000", "nonurban_acres", "urban_acres", "change_urban_acres_2000", "year", "metro", "source", "total_acres"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Percent change in number of urbanized acres since 2000", "Total number of unurbanized acres in metro area", "Total number of urbanized acres in metro area", "Net change in number of urbanized acres since 2000", "", "", "", "Total number of acres in metro area"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-11-23T00:13:24.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "environment", "infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/t5dc-hsaj", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Greenfield-Development-by-metro-area/t5dc-hsaj", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

While a significant share of residents may choose to rent, home prices represent a primary driver of housing affordability in a given region, county or city.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nZillow: Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) - http://www.zillow.com/research/data/  \n2000-2021\n\nCalifornia Department of Finance: E-4 Historical Population Estimates for Cities, Counties, and the State - https://dof.ca.gov/forecasting/demographics/estimates/  \n2000-2021\n\nUS Census Population and Housing Unit Estimates - https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest.html  \n2000-2021\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics: Consumer Price Index - http://data.bls.gov  \n2000-2021\n\nUS Census ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) - https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html  \n2020 Census Blocks\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nHousing price estimates at the regional-, county-, city- and zip code-level come from analysis of individual home sales by Zillow based upon transaction records. Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) is a smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure of the typical home value and market changes across a given region and housing type. It reflects the typical value for homes in the 35th to 65th percentile range. ZHVI is computed from public record transaction data as reported by counties. All standard real estate transactions are included in this metric, including REO sales and auctions. Zillow makes a substantial effort to remove transactions not typically considered a standard sale. Examples of these include bank takeovers of foreclosed properties, title transfers after a death or divorce and non arms-length transactions. Zillow defines all homes as single-family residential, condominium and co-operative homes with a county record. Single-family residences are detached, which means the home is an individual structure with its own lot. Condominiums are units that can be owned in a multi-unit complex, such as an apartment building. Co-operative homes are slightly different from condominiums in that the homeowners own shares in the corporation that owns the building, not the actual units themselves.\n\nFor metropolitan area comparison values, the Bay Area metro area\u2019s median home sale price is the population-weighted average of the nine counties\u2019 median home prices. Data is adjusted for inflation using Bureau of Labor Statistics metropolitan statistical area (MSA)-specific series. Inflation-adjusted data are presented to illustrate how home prices have grown relative to overall price increases; that said, the use of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) does create some challenges given the fact that housing represents a major chunk of consumer goods bundle used to calculate CPI.

This is a derivative feature set, assembled by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC), created by merging county-specific, land-only inundation feature sets. The source, county-level feature sets were produced for Adapting to Rising Tides (ART), a program led by the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC), in September 2017.\n\nThe sea level rise (SLR) scenario used to produce this data represents 36 inches (three feet) of water level above the current mean higher high water (MHHW) tidal datum. This is considered the most likely level of sea level rise expected by 2100; or an existing 50-year extreme tide. The polygons contain the extent and depth of land-only inundation (in feet) flooding of the bayside shoreline. Depth of flooding were created by subtracting a land surface Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from the water surface DEM representing the SLR scenario (MHHW + SLR). Extent of flooding were created by employing a two rule assessment to determine if an area is inundated. It must be below the assigned water surface DEM elevation value, and it must be connected to an adjacent area that was either flooded or open water. This method applies an \"eight-side rule\" for connectedness, where the area is considered \"connected\" if any of its cardinal or diagonal directions is connected to a flooded area or open water. Hydraulic connectivity assessment removes areas from the inundation zone if they are protected by levees or other topographic features that prevent inland inundation. This assessment also removed areas that are low lying but inland and not directly connected to an adjacent inundated area.\n\nThe 36 inch SLR scenario can be used to approximate all extreme tide/sea level rise combinations that produce a water level in the range of MHHW + 33 inches to MHHW + 39 inches, including:\n\t- 36 inches of SLR;\n\t- 1-year extreme tide event coupled with 24 inches of SLR;\n\t- 2-year extreme tide event coupled with 18 inches of SLR;\n\t- 5-year extreme tide event coupled with 12 inches of SLR;\n\t- 25-year extreme tide event coupled with 6 inches of SLR, and\n\t- 50-year extreme tide event under existing conditions (no SLR).\n\n\nPublication Date: June 2019\n\nCreation Date: March 2019\n\nStatus:\nProgress: Complete\nMaintenance and Update Frequency: None planned\n\nContact Information:\nContact Organization: Metropolitan Transportation Commission\nContact Person: Data & Visualization\n\nContact Address:\nAddress Type: mailing and physical\nAddress: 375 Beale Street, Suite 800\nCity: San Francisco\nState or Province: California\nPostal Code: 94105\nCountry: United States of America\n\nContact Voice Telephone: (415) 778-6700\nContact Electronic Mail Address: dataviz@bayareametro.gov\nHours: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM (PST) Monday through Friday", "attribution": "San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission's Adapting to Rising Tides Program", "attribution_link": "https://www.adaptingtorisingtides.org", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-09T00:07:18.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-03-13T18:27:14.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-09T00:07:18.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-03-13T19:05:22.000Z", "columns_name": ["the_geom", "objectid", "countyfp", "depth_ft", "statefp"], "columns_field_name": ["the_geom", "objectid", "countyfp", "depth_ft", "statefp"], "columns_datatype": ["MultiPolygon", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Feature geometry.

This measure reflects the changing industry trends that affect our region\u2019s workers.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nBureau of Labor Statistics: Current Employment Statistics\n1990-2017\nhttp://data.bls.gov\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nThe California Employment Development Department (EDD) provides estimates of employment by place of work and by industry. Industries are classified by their North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Vital Signs aggregates employment into 11 industry sectors: Farm, Mining, Logging and Construction, Manufacturing, Trade, Transportation and Utilities, Information, Financial Activities, Professional and Business Services, Educational and Health Services, Leisure and Hospitality, Government, and Other. EDD counts all public-sector jobs under Government, including public transportation, public schools, and public hospitals. The Other category includes service jobs such as auto repair and hair salons and organizations such as churches and social advocacy groups. Employment in the technology sector are classified under three categories: Professional and Business Services, Information, and Manufacturing. The latter category includes electronic and computer manufacturing. For further details of typical firms found in each sector, refer to the 2012 NAICS Manual (http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart=2012).\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides industry estimates for non-Bay Area metro areas. Their main industry employment estimates, the Current Employment Survey and Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, do not provide annual estimates of farm employment. To be consistent, the metro comparison evaluates nonfarm employment for all metro areas, including the Bay Area. Industry shares are thus slightly different for the Bay Area between the historical trend and metro comparison sections.\n\nThe location quotient (LQ) is used to evaluate level of concentration or clustering of an industry within the Bay Area and within each county of the region. A location quotient greater than 1 means there is a strong concentration for of jobs in an industry sector. For the Bay Area, the LQ is calculated as the share of the region\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the nation\u2019s employment in that same sector. Because BLS does not provide national farm estimates, note that there is no LQ for regional farm employment.

Industries are classified by their North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Vital Signs aggregates employment into 11 industry sectors: Farm, Mining, Logging and Construction, Manufacturing, Trade, Transportation and Utilities, Information, Financial Activities, Professional and Business Services, Educational and Health Services, Leisure and Hospitality, Government, and Other. EDD counts all public-sector jobs under Government, including public transportation, public schools, and public hospitals. The Other category includes service jobs such as auto repair and hair salons and organizations such as churches and social advocacy groups. Employment in the technology sector are classified under three categories: Professional and Business Services, Information, and Manufacturing. The latter category includes electronic and computer manufacturing. For further details of typical firms found in each sector, refer to the 2012 NAICS Manual (http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart=2012).\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides industry estimates for non-Bay Area metro areas. Their main industry employment estimates, the Current Employment Survey and Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, do not provide annual estimates of farm employment. To be consistent, the metro comparison evaluates nonfarm employment for all metro areas, including the Bay Area. Industry shares are thus slightly different for the Bay Area between the historical trend and metro comparison sections.\n\nThe location quotient (LQ) is used to evaluate level of concentration or clustering of an industry within the Bay Area and within each county of the region. A location quotient greater than 1 means there is a strong concentration for of jobs in an industry sector. For the Bay Area, the LQ is calculated as the share of the region\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the nation\u2019s employment in that same sector. Because BLS does not provide national farm estimates, note that there is no LQ for regional farm employment. For each county, the LQ is calculated as the share of the county\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the region\u2019s employment in that same sector.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-08-13T16:20:33.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-08-10T01:09:17.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-08-13T16:20:33.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-08-10T01:10:27.000Z", "columns_name": ["PercentChange_1990", "Difference_1990", "Year", "Industry", "Geo.Name", "Source"], "columns_field_name": ["percentchange_1990", "difference_1990", "year", "industry", "geo_name", "source"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Percent change in number of jobs in industry since 1990", "Change in number of jobs in industry since 1990", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-08-10T01:10:27.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["economy", "infrastructure", "transportation"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/tm3u-9jvc", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Change-in-Jobs-by-Industry-Bay-Area/tm3u-9jvc", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

{"resource": {"name": "ART Bay Area Inundation Scenario - 77\" Sea Level Rise", "id": "tpcb-xsma", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Inundation feature set representing areas vulnerable to a 77 inch rise in sea level for the San Francisco Bay Region. This is a derivative feature set, assembled by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC), created by merging county-specific, land-only inundation feature sets. The source, county-level feature sets were produced for Adapting to Rising Tides (ART), a program led by the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC), in September 2017.\n\nThe sea level rise (SLR) scenario used to produce this data represents 77 inches (a little less than six and one-half feet) of water level above the current mean higher high water (MHHW) tidal datum. This is also considered equivalent to 36 inches of SLR plus a 100-year extreme tide. The polygons contain the extent and depth of land-only inundation (in feet) flooding of the bayside shoreline. Depth of flooding were created by subtracting a land surface Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from the water surface DEM representing the SLR scenario (MHHW + SLR). Extent of flooding were created by employing a two rule assessment to determine if an area is inundated. It must be below the assigned water surface DEM elevation value, and it must be connected to an adjacent area that was either flooded or open water. This method applies an \"eight-side rule\" for connectedness, where the area is considered \"connected\" if any of its cardinal or diagonal directions is connected to a flooded area or open water. Hydraulic connectivity assessment removes areas from the inundation zone if they are protected by levees or other topographic features that prevent inland inundation. This assessment also removed areas that are low lying but inland and not directly connected to an adjacent inundated area.\n\nThe 77 inch SLR scenario can be used to approximate all extreme tide/sea level rise combinations that produce a water level in the range of MHHW + 74 inches to MHHW + 80 inches, including:\n\t- 77 inches of SLR;\n\t- 1-year extreme tide event coupled with 66 inches of SLR;\n\t- 2-year extreme tide event coupled with 60 inches of SLR;\n\t- 5-year extreme tide event coupled with 54 inches of SLR;\n\t- 10-year extreme tide event coupled with 52 inches of SLR;\n\t- 25-year extreme tide event coupled with 48 inches of SLR;\n\t- 50-year extreme tide event coupled with 42 inches of SLR, and\n\t- 100-year extreme tide event coupled with 36 inches of SLR.\n\n**In 2019, The San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission released additional data to add East Contra Costa and Solano areas to the existing, 2017 data that focused on San Francisco Bay. This update did not include all the sea level scenarios produced in 2017.

The definition involves a racial/ethnic concentration threshold and a poverty test. The racial/ethnic concentration threshold is straightforward: R/ECAPs must have a non-white population of 50 percent or more. Regarding the poverty threshold, Wilson (1980) defines neighborhoods of extreme poverty as census tracts with 40 percent or more of individuals living at or below the poverty line. Because overall poverty levels are substantially lower in many parts of the country, HUD supplements this with an alternate criterion. Thus, a neighborhood can be a R/ECAP if it has a poverty rate that exceeds 40% or is three or more times the average tract poverty rate for the metropolitan/micropolitan area, whichever threshold is lower. Census tracts with this extreme poverty that satisfy the racial/ethnic concentration threshold are deemed R/ECAPs. \n\nData Source: Decennial census (2010); American Community Survey (ACS), 2006-2010; Brown Longitudinal Tract Database (LTDB) based on decennial census data, 2000 & 1990 References: Wilson, William J.

Authorized by the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, the National Park Service's National Register of Historic Places is part of a national program to coordinate and support public and private efforts to identify, evaluate, and protect America's historic and archeological resources.\n\nThe National Park Service Cultural Resources GIS program has created spatial data from the unrestricted National Register of Historic Places database (NRIS) inventory in a file geodatabase format using ESRI\u2019s ArcMap 10.0. The data model is structured in compliance with NPS Cultural Resources Spatial Data Transfer Standards. More detail on the model and these standards can be found here: https://www.nps.gov/crgis/crgis_standards_overview.htm\n\nUse of this information in meeting a federal agency\u2019s responsibilities under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act does not in itself constitute compliance with Section 106, which requires agencies to consult with the appropriate State and/or Tribal Preservation Offices in the identification and evaluation of historic properties.\n\nUsers should be aware that many points and polygon boundaries require some level of correction. In general, this dataset contains modest corrections to the coordinates contained in the NRIS with reference to some of the point data.

They reflect delay on a typical weekday, which is defined as Tuesday through Thursday during peak traffic months. Delay statistics emphasize recurring delay - i.e. consistent delay greater than 15 minutes on a specific freeway segment.

This is due to the fact that more localized data is not included in the 1-year dataset across all Bay Area cities. Similarly, modal data is not available for every Bay Area city or census tract, even when the 5-year data is used for those localized geographies.\n\nRegional commute times were calculated by summing aggregate county travel times and dividing by the relevant population; similarly, modal commute time were calculated using aggregate times and dividing by the number of communities choosing that mode for the given geography.

The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, county, city and census tract tables by place of residence.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census (1960, 1970) - via MTC/ABAG Bay Area Census - http://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/transportation/Means19602000.htm\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census (1980-2000) - via MTC/ABAG Bay Area Census - http://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/transportation/Means19802000.htm\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey - https://data.census.gov/  \n2006-2021  \nForm B08301 (1-year and 5-year)\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nCommute mode choice, also known as commute mode share, refers to the mode of transportation that a commuter usually uses to travel to work, such as driving alone, biking, carpooling or taking transit. For the decennial Census datasets, the breakdown of auto commuters between drive alone and carpool is not available before 1980. American Community Survey 1-year data is used for larger geographies \u2013 Bay counties and most metropolitan area counties \u2013 while smaller geographies rely upon 5-year rolling average data due to their smaller sample sizes. This will result in discrepancies in cases like San Francisco where it is both a city and a county. Note that 2020 data uses the 5-year estimates because the ACS did not collect 1-year data for 2020. Additionally, for the County by place of residence breakdown, Napa was missing ACS 1-Year commute mode choice data for all modes for 2007, 2008, 2011 and 2021. 5-Year estimates were used to fill the missing data for 2011 and 2021, but not 2007 or 2008 since the 5-Year estimates start in 2009.\n\nRegional mode shares are population-weighted averages of the nine counties' modal shares. \"Auto\" includes drive alone and carpool for the simple data tables and is broken out in the detailed data tables accordingly, as it was not available before 1980. \"Transit\" includes public operators (Muni, BART, etc.) and employer-provided shuttles (e.g., Google shuttle buses). \"Other\" includes motorcycle, taxi, and other modes of transportation; bicycle mode share was broken out separately for the first time in the 2006 data and is shown in the detailed data tables. Census tract data is not available for tracts with insufficient numbers of residents or workers.\n\nThe metropolitan area comparison was performed for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area in addition to the primary metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) for other major metropolitan areas.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-20T17:13:57.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-07-08T00:17:06.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-20T17:13:57.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-01-31T23:57:33.000Z", "columns_name": ["Share", "Data_Type", "County", "Mode", "Source", "Year"], "columns_field_name": ["share", "data_type", "county", "mode", "source", "year"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-07-08T00:17:08.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/uhk5-xynh", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Commute-Mode-Choice-by-Place-of-Reside/uhk5-xynh", "owner": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}, "creator": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}}

This measure reflects the changing industry trends that affect our region\u2019s workers.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nBureau of Labor Statistics, Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) - https://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm  \n1990-2021  \n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nQuarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) employment data is reported by the place of work and represent the number of covered workers who worked during, or received pay for, the pay period that included the 12th day of the month. Covered employees in the private-sector and in the state and local government include most corporate officials, all executives, all supervisory personnel, all professionals, all clerical workers, many farmworkers, all wage earners, all piece workers and all part-time workers. Workers on paid sick leave, paid holiday, paid vacation and the like are also covered.\n\nBesides excluding the aforementioned national security agencies, QCEW excludes proprietors, the unincorporated self-employed, unpaid family members, certain farm and domestic workers exempted from having to report employment data and railroad workers covered by the railroad unemployment insurance system. Excluded as well are workers who earned no wages during the entire applicable pay period because of work stoppages, temporary layoffs, illness or unpaid vacations. \n\nThe location quotient (LQ) is used to evaluate level of concentration or clustering of an industry within the Bay Area and within each county of the region. A location quotient greater than 1 means there is a strong concentration for of jobs in an industry sector. For the Bay Area, the LQ is calculated as the share of the region\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of California's employment in that same sector. For each county, the LQ is calculated as the share of the county\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the region\u2019s employment in that same sector.\n\nData is mainly pulled from aggregation level 73, which is county-level summarized at the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) supersector level (12 sectors). This aggregation level exhibits the least loss due to data suppression, in the magnitude of 1-2 percent for regional employment, and is therefore preferred. However, the supersectors group together NAICS 11 Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting; NAICS 21 Mining and NAICS 23 Construction. To provide a separate tally of Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting, the aggregation level 74 data was used for NAICS codes 11, 21 and 23. \n\nQCEW reports on employment in Public Administration as NAICS 92. However, many government activities are reported with an industry specific code - such as transportation or utilities even if those may be public governmental entities. In 2021 for the Bay Area, the largest industry groupings under public ownership are Education and health services (58%); Public administration (29%) and Trade, transportation, and utilities (29%).

The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, mode and operator tables for total typical weekday boardings.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nFederal Transit Administration: National Transit Database - http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm  \n1991-2022\n\nCalifornia Department of Finance: E-4 Historical Population Estimates for Cities, Counties, and the State - https://dof.ca.gov/forecasting/demographics/estimates/  \n1991-2022\n\nUS Census Population and Housing Unit Estimates - https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest.html  \n1991-2022\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nThe National Transit Database (NTD) dataset was lightly cleaned to correct for erroneous zero values - in which null values (unsubmitted data) were incorrectly marked as zeroes. Paratransit data is sparse in early years of the NTD dataset, meaning that transit ridership estimates in the early 1990s are likely underestimated. Simple modes were aggregated to combine the various bus modes (e.g. rapid bus, express bus, local bus) into a single mode to avoid incorrect conclusions resulting from mode recoding over the lifespan of NTD.\n\n2022 data should be considered preliminary, as it comes from the monthly data tables rather than the longer-term time series dataset. Weekday ridership is calculated by taking the total annual ridership and dividing by 300, an assumption which is consistent with MTC travel modeling procedures; it was also compared to observed weekday boarding data (which is more limited in availability) to ensure consistency on the regional level. Per-capita transit ridership is calculated for the operator's general service area or taxation district; for example, BART includes the three core counties (San Francisco, Alameda, and Contra Costa), as well as northern San Mateo County post-SFO extension, and AC Transit includes the cities located within its service area. For other metro areas, operators were identified by developing a list of all urbanized areas within a current MSA boundary and then using that UZA list to flag relevant operators; this means that all operators (both large and small) were included in the metro comparison data.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-13T17:55:00.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-06-29T19:52:06.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-13T17:55:00.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-10T22:59:00.000Z", "columns_name": ["Percentchg_1991", "Annual_Boardings", "Year", "System", "Objectid", "Est_Weekday_Boardings", "System_Full_Name", "Source", "Agency_Size"], "columns_field_name": ["percentchg_1991", "annual_boardings", "year", "system", "objectid", "est_weekday_boardings", "system_full_name", "source", "agency_size"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Ridership Change Since 1991", "Annual Boardings", "Year", "Transit Operator", "objectid", "Estimated Weekday Boardings", "Transit System Name", "Source", "Groups operators into large and small operators"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-08-18T18:38:53.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Transportation", "domain_tags": ["t11t12", "vital signs", "vital signs 2.0"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/uk8v-3g2v", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/Transportation/Vital-Signs-Transit-Ridership-by-Operator-Bay-Area/uk8v-3g2v", "owner": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}, "creator": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}}

{"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Jobs by Industry by County (2022)", "id": "uq26-k9zb", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR  \nJobs by Industry (EC1)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME  \nEmployment by place of work by industry sector\n\nLAST UPDATED  \nDecember 2022\n\nDESCRIPTION  \nJobs by industry refers to both the change in employment levels by industry and the proportional mix of jobs by economic sector. This measure reflects the changing industry trends that affect our region\u2019s workers.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nBureau of Labor Statistics, Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) - https://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm  \n1990-2021  \n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nQuarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) employment data is reported by the place of work and represent the number of covered workers who worked during, or received pay for, the pay period that included the 12th day of the month. Covered employees in the private-sector and in the state and local government include most corporate officials, all executives, all supervisory personnel, all professionals, all clerical workers, many farmworkers, all wage earners, all piece workers and all part-time workers. Workers on paid sick leave, paid holiday, paid vacation and the like are also covered.\n\nBesides excluding the aforementioned national security agencies, QCEW excludes proprietors, the unincorporated self-employed, unpaid family members, certain farm and domestic workers exempted from having to report employment data and railroad workers covered by the railroad unemployment insurance system. Excluded as well are workers who earned no wages during the entire applicable pay period because of work stoppages, temporary layoffs, illness or unpaid vacations. \n\nThe location quotient (LQ) is used to evaluate level of concentration or clustering of an industry within the Bay Area and within each county of the region. A location quotient greater than 1 means there is a strong concentration for of jobs in an industry sector. For the Bay Area, the LQ is calculated as the share of the region\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of California's employment in that same sector. For each county, the LQ is calculated as the share of the county\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the region\u2019s employment in that same sector.\n\nData is mainly pulled from aggregation level 73, which is county-level summarized at the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) supersector level (12 sectors). This aggregation level exhibits the least loss due to data suppression, in the magnitude of 1-2 percent for regional employment, and is therefore preferred. However, the supersectors group together NAICS 11 Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting; NAICS 21 Mining and NAICS 23 Construction. To provide a separate tally of Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting, the aggregation level 74 data was used for NAICS codes 11, 21 and 23. \n\nQCEW reports on employment in Public Administration as NAICS 92. However, many government activities are reported with an industry specific code - such as transportation or utilities even if those may be public governmental entities. In 2021 for the Bay Area, the largest industry groupings under public ownership are Education and health services (58%); Public administration (29%) and Trade, transportation, and utilities (29%). With the exception of Education and health services, all other public activities were coded as government/public administration, regardless of industry group.\n\nFor the county data there were some industries that reported 0 jobs or did not report jobs at the desired aggregation/NAICS level for the following counties/years:\n\nFarm:  \n(aggregation level: 74, NAICS code: 11)\n- Contra Costa: 2008-2010\n- Marin: 1990-2006, 2008-2010, 2014-2020\n- Napa: 1990-2004, 2013-2021\n- San Francisco: 2019-2020\n- San Mateo: 2013\n\nInformation:  \n(aggregation level: 73, NAICS code: 51)\n- Solano: 2001\n\nFinancial Activities:  \n(aggregatio", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-13T17:54:04.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-06-10T00:59:08.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-13T17:54:04.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-12-14T21:21:08.000Z", "columns_name": ["Uncl", "Other", "Govt", "Ehs", "Pbs", "Fa", "Ttu", "Manuf", "Mlc", "Farm", "Total", "Year", "Geoname", "Objectid", "Source", "Lh", "Inform"], "columns_field_name": ["uncl", "other", "govt", "ehs", "pbs", "fa", "ttu", "manuf", "mlc", "farm", "total", "year", "geo_name", "objectid", "source", "lh", "inform"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Unclassified Employment", "Other Service Employment", "Government Employment", "Education and health services Employment", "Professional and business services Employment", "Financial activities Employment", "Trade, transportation, and utilities Employment", "Manufacturing Employment", "Natural resources, mining and construction Employment", "farm", "Total Employment", "Year", "Geography", "objectid", "Source", "Leisure and hospitality Employment", "Information Employment"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-12-14T21:18:40.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Economy", "domain_tags": ["ec1", "vital signs", "vital signs 2.0"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/uq26-k9zb", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/Economy/Vital-Signs-Jobs-by-Industry-by-County-2022-/uq26-k9zb", "owner": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}, "creator": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}}

Income data highlight how employees are being compensated for their work on an inflation-adjusted basis.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census - https://nhgis.org  \nCount 4Pb (1970)  \nForm STF3 (1980-1990)  \nForm SF3a (2000)\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey - https://data.census.gov/  \nForm B19001 (2005-2021; household income by place of residence)  \nForm B19013 (2005-2021; median household income by place of residence)  \nForm B08521 (2005-2021; median worker earnings by place of employment)\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics: Consumer Price Index - https://www.bls.gov/data/  \n1970-2021\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nIncome derived from the decennial Census data reflects the income earned in the prior calendar year, whereas income derived from the American Community Survey (ACS) data reflects the prior 12 month period; note that this inconsistency has a minor effect on historical comparisons (see Income and Earnings Data section of the ACS General Handbook - https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2020/acs/acs_general_handbook_2020_ch09.pdf). ACS 1-year data is used for larger geographies \u2013 Bay counties and most metropolitan area counties \u2013 while smaller geographies rely upon 5-year rolling average data due to their smaller sample sizes. Note that 2020 data uses the 5-year estimates because the ACS did not collect 1-year data for 2020.\n\nQuintile income for 1970-2000 is imputed from decennial Census data using methodology from the California Department of Finance. Bay Area income is the population weighted average of county-level income.\n\nIncome has been inflated using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for 2021 specific to each metro area; however, some metro areas lack metro-specific CPI data back to 1970 and therefore adjusted data uses national CPI for 1970. Note that current MSA boundaries were used for historical comparison by identifying counties included in today\u2019s metro areas.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-20T17:25:45.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-06-08T00:04:44.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-20T17:25:45.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-01T00:30:37.000Z", "columns_name": ["Source", "40_Percentile_HH_Inc_PlaceOfResidence_IA", "60_Percentile_HH_Inc_PlaceOfResidence_IA", "80_Percentile_HH_Inc_PlaceOfResidence_IA", "20_Percentile_HH_Inc_PlaceOfResidence_IA", "Residence_Geo", "20_Percentile_HH_Inc_PlaceOfResidence_IA_PerChg1970", "60_Percentile_HH_Inc_PlaceOfResidence_IA_PerChg1970", "80_Percentile_HH_Inc_PlaceOfResidence_IA_PerChg1970", "40_Percentile_HH_Inc_PlaceOfResidence_IA_PerChg1970", "Year"], "columns_field_name": ["source", "_40_percentile_hh_inc_placeofresidence_ia", "_60_percentile_hh_inc_placeofresidence_ia", "_80_percentile_hh_inc_placeofresidence_ia", "_20_percentile_hh_inc_placeofresidence_ia", "residence_geo", "_20_percentile_hh_inc_placeofresidence_ia_perchg1970", "_60_percentile_hh_inc_placeofresidence_ia_perchg1970", "_80_percentile_hh_inc_placeofresidence_ia_perchg1970", "_40_percentile_hh_inc_placeofresidence_ia_perchg1970", "year"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-06-08T00:04:46.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/uqny-9tcf", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Income-Quintile-by-Place-of-Residence-/uqny-9tcf", "owner": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}, "creator": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}}

While \u201cat risk\u201d households may not necessarily be displaced in the short-term or long-term, neighborhoods identified as being \u201cat risk\u201d signify pressure as reflected by the decline in lower-income households (who are presumed to relocate to other more affordable communities). The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, county and census tract tables. \n\nDATA SOURCE\nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census\n1980-1990\nForm STF3\nhttps://nhgis.org\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census\n2000\nForm SF3a\nhttps://nhgis.org\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census\n1980-2010\nLongitudinal Tract Database\nhttp://www.s4.brown.edu/us2010/index.htm\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey\n2010-2015\nForm S1901\n5-year rolling average\nhttp://factfinder2.census.gov\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey\n2010-2017\nForm B19013\n5-year rolling average\nhttp://factfinder2.census.gov\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nAligning with the approach used for Plan Bay Area 2040, displacement risk is calculated by comparing the analysis year with the most recent year prior to identify census tracts that are losing lower-income households. Historical data is pulled from U.S. Census datasets and aligned with today\u2019s census tract boundaries using crosswalk tables provided by LTDB. Tract data, as well as regional income data, are calculated using 5-year rolling averages for consistency \u2013 given that tract data is only available on a 5-year basis. Using household tables by income level, the number of households in each tract falling below the median are summed, which involves summing all brackets below the regional median and then summing a fractional share of the bracket that includes the regional median (assuming a simple linear distribution within that bracket).\n\nOnce all tracts in a given county or metro area are synced to today\u2019s boundaries, the analysis identifies census tracts of greater than 500 lower-income people (in the prior year) to filter out low-population areas. For those tracts, any net loss between the prior year and the analysis year results in that tract being flagged as being at risk of displacement, and all lower-income households in that tract are flagged. To calculate the share of households at risk, the number of lower-income households living in flagged tracts are summed and divided by the total number of lower-income households living in the larger geography (county or metro). Minor deviations on a year-to-year basis should be taken in context, given that data on the tract level often fluctuates and has a significant margin of error; changes on the county and regional level are more appropriate to consider on an annual basis instead.", "attribution": "U.S. Census Bureau", "attribution_link": "http://api.census.gov", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-08-13T16:06:00.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-12-12T22:26:37.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-08-13T16:06:00.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2018-12-12T22:31:04.000Z", "columns_name": ["Displacement_Risk", "Region", "Source3", "Source1", "Source2", "Year", "LIHH_At_Risk", "LIHH_Total"], "columns_field_name": ["displacement_risk", "region", "source3", "source1", "source2", "year", "lihh_at_risk", "lihh_total"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Share of lower income households at risk", "", "", "", "", "", "Number of lower-income households at risk", "Total number of lower-income households"], "columns_format": [{"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-12-12T22:31:05.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "infrastructure", "environment"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/uyub-9ixw", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Displacement-Risk-Bay-Area/uyub-9ixw", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

Vital Signs tracks greenhouse gas emissions linked to consumption from the three largest sources in the region: surface transportation, electricity consumption, and natural gas consumption. This measure helps track progress towards achieving regional greenhouse gas reduction targets, including the region's per-capita greenhouse gas target for surface transportation under Senate Bill 375. This dataset includes emissions estimates on the regional and county levels.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nUS Energy Information Administration: Carbon Dioxide Emissions Coefficients - https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/co2_vol_mass.php  \n1990-2021\n\nCalifornia Energy Commission: Retail Fuel Outlet Annual Reporting (Form CEC-A15) - https://www.energy.ca.gov/data-reports/energy-almanac/transportation-energy/california-retail-fuel-outlet-annual-reporting  \n2010-2021\n\nCalifornia Energy Commission: Electricity Consumption by County - http://www.ecdms.energy.ca.gov/elecbycounty.aspx  \n1990-2021\n\nCalifornia Energy Commission: Natural Gas Consumption by County - http://www.ecdms.energy.ca.gov/gasbycounty.aspx  \n1990-2021\n\nCalifornia Department of Finance: Population and Housing Estimates, E-4 - http://www.dof.ca.gov/research/demographic/  \n1990-2021\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nEmissions in this dataset are reported in metric tons. For surface transportation, the dataset is based on a survey of fueling stations, the vast majority of which respond to the survey; the California Energy Commission (CEC) corrects for non-response bias by imputing the remaining share of fuel sales. Note that 2014 data was excluded to data abnormalities for several counties in the region; methodology improvements in 2012 affected estimated by +/- 5% according to CEC estimates. For years 2013 and 2014, a linear trendline assumption was used instead between 2012 and 2015 data points. Data from the CEC is limited to retail sales, therefore Vital Signs surface transportation emissions estimates are limited to GHG from retail fuel sales. Retail gasoline sales represent most of the gasoline consumed for surface transportation, but retail diesel sales are just a fraction of all diesel consumed for surface transportation. Greenhouse gas emissions are calculated based on the gallons of gasoline and diesel sales, relying upon standardized Energy Information Administration conversion rates for E10 fuel (gasoline with 10% ethanol) and standard diesel. Per-capita greenhouse gas emissions are calculated simply by dividing emissions attributable to fuel sold in that county by the total number of county residents; there may be a slight bias in the data given that a fraction of fuel sold in a given county may be purchased by non-residents. Future refinements to the Vital Signs methodology for monitoring GHG emissions from all surface transportation will seek to more closely align monitoring data with estimates from the California Air Resources Board's EMFAC model.\n\nFor electricity consumption, the dataset is based on electricity consumption data for the nine Bay Area counties; note that this is different than electricity production as the region imports electricity. Because such data is not disaggregated by utility provider, a simple assumption is made that electricity consumed has the greenhouse gas emissions intensity of Pacific Gas & Electric, the primary electricity provider in the Bay Area. For this reason, with the small but growing market share of low- and zero-GHG community choice aggregation (CCA) providers, the greenhouse gas emissions estimate in more recent years may be slightly overestimated.

To allow for historical comparisons, the Census Bureau merges housing expenditure brackets into three consistent bins (less than 20 percent, 20 percent to 34 percent, and more than 35 percent) that work for all years. The highest income bracket for renters in the ACS data was \\$100,000 or more, while the homeowner dataset included brackets for \\$100,000 to \\$149,999 and \\$150,000 and above. These brackets were merged together to allow for uniform comparison across tenure. While some studies use 30 percent as the affordability threshold, Vital Signs uses 35 percent as this is the closest break point using the standardized affordability brackets above.\n\nACS 1-year data is used for larger geographies \u2013 Bay counties and most metropolitan area counties \u2013 while smaller geographies rely upon 5-year rolling average data due to their smaller sample sizes. Note that 2020 data uses the 5-year estimates because the ACS did not collect 1-year data for 2020.\n\nIncome breakdown data is only provided for one year as it is not possible to compare consistent inflation-adjusted income brackets over time given Census data limitations. For the county breakdown, Napa was missing ACS 1-Year renter data for all years except 2012 and 2013, and Marin was missing ACS 1-Year renter data for 2019 \u2014 these counties used 5-Year data for those years.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-17T09:20:08.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-06-20T22:12:23.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-17T09:20:08.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-01-03T19:48:46.000Z", "columns_name": ["Income Bracket", "Geography", "Renter_Source", "Owner_Source", "Year", "Share", "Housing_Burden"], "columns_field_name": ["income_bracket", "geography", "renter_source", "owner_source", "year", "share", "housing_burden"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-12-29T21:29:03.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/va7e-4jn9", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Housing-Affordability-County-by-Income/va7e-4jn9", "owner": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}, "creator": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}}

Fine particulate matter particles are very small, measuring less than 2.5 microns (\u03bcg) or 1/25 the width of a human hair \u2013 yet they pose a significant health risk. Air quality standards for particulate matter are expressed in two ways: the annual average (reflecting average concentrations during the course of a given year) and the 24-hour average (reflecting worst-case conditions in a given year).

Data either reflect the annual average or the 98th percentile day (worst-case conditions); some data are reported as three-year rolling averages to minimize noise associated with any given year. The worst location site may shift from year to year depending on which sensor location had the highest levels of fine particulate matter over that particular time period.

The unemployment rate reflects the strength of the overall employment market.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nCalifornia Employment Development Department: Historical Unemployment Rates\n1990-2018\nhttps://data.edd.ca.gov/Labor-Force-and-Unemployment-Rates/Local-Area-Unemployment-Statistics-LAUS-Annual-Ave/7jbb-3rb8\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nUnemployment rates produced by EDD for the region and county levels are not adjusted for seasonality (as they reflect annual data) and are final data (i.e., not preliminary). Unemployment rates produced by BLS for the metro regions are adjusted for seasonality; they reflect the primary MSA for the named region, except for the San Francisco Bay Area which uses the nine-county region.

Similarly, modal data is not available for every Bay Area city or census tract, even when the 5-year data is used for those localized geographies.\n\nRegional commute times were calculated by summing aggregate county travel times and dividing by the relevant population; similarly, modal commute times were calculated using aggregate times and dividing by the number of communities choosing that mode for the given geography. \n\nCensus tract data is not available for tracts with insufficient numbers of residents.

While a significant share of residents may choose to rent, home prices represent a primary driver of housing affordability in a given region, county or city.\t\n\nDATA SOURCE\nZillow\nMedian Sale Price (1997-2018)\nhttp://www.zillow.com/research/data/\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics: Consumer Price Index\nAll Urban Consumers Data Table (1997-2018; specific to each metro area)\nhttp://data.bls.gov\n\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nMedian housing price estimates for the region, counties, cities, and zip code come from analysis of individual home sales by Zillow. The median sale price is the price separating the higher half of the sales from the lower half. In other words, 50 percent of home sales are below or above the median value. Zillow defines all homes as single-family residential, condominium, and co-operative homes with a county record. Single-family residences are detached, which means the home is an individual structure with its own lot. Condominiums are units that you own in a multi-unit complex, such as an apartment building.

Regional and local geographies rely on data collected by real Answers, a research organization and database publisher specializing in the multifamily housing market. real Answers focuses on collecting longitudinal data for individual rental properties through quarterly surveys. For the Bay Area, their database is comprised of properties with 40 to 3,000+ housing units. Median list prices most likely have an upward bias due to the exclusion of smaller properties. The bias may be most extreme in geographies where large rental properties represent a small portion of the overall rental market. A map of the individual properties surveyed is included in the Local Focus section. \r\n\r\nIndividual properties surveyed provided lower- and upper-bound ranges for the various types of housing available (studio, 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, etc.). Median lower- and upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the regional and county geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the average of the median lower- and upper-bound prices for the region and counties. Median upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the city geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the median upper-bound price for cities. For simplicity, only the mean list rent is displayed for the individual properties. The metro areas geography rely upon Zillow data, which is the median price for rentals listed through www.zillow.com during the month. Like the real Answers data, Zillow's median list prices most likely have an upward bias since small properties are underrepresented in Zillow's listings. The metro area data for the Bay Area cannot be compared to the regional Bay Area data. Due to afore mentioned data limitations, this data is suitable for analyzing the change in list rents over time but not necessarily comparisons of absolute list rents. Metro area boundaries reflects today\u2019s metro area definitions by county for consistency, rather than historical metro area boundaries.\r\n\r\nDue to the limited number of rental properties surveyed, city-level data is unavailable for Atherton, Belvedere, Brisbane, Calistoga, Clayton, Cloverdale, Cotati, Fairfax, Half Moon Bay, Healdsburg, Hillsborough, Los Altos Hills, Monte Sereno, Moranga, Oakley, Orinda, Portola Valley, Rio Vista, Ross, San Anselmo, San Carlos, Saratoga, Sebastopol, Windsor, Woodside, and Yountville.\r\n\r\nInflation-adjusted data are presented to illustrate how rents have grown relative to overall price increases; that said, the use of the Consumer Price Index does create some challenges given the fact that housing represents a major chunk of consumer goods bundle used to calculate CPI.

{"resource": {"name": "CTCAC/HCD Resource Opportunity Areas 2022", "id": "vr7h-smni", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "In 2017, the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee (CTCAC) and the Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) created the California Fair Housing Task Force (Task Force). The Task Force was asked to assist CTCAC and HCD in creating evidence-based approaches to increasing access to opportunity for families with children living in housing subsidized by the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program.\n\nThis feature set contains Resource Opportunity Areas (ROAs) that are the results of the Task Force's analysis for the two regions used for the San Francisco Bay Region; one is for the cities and towns (urban) and the other is for the rural areas. The reason for treating urban and rural areas as separate reasons is that using absolute thresholds for place-based opportunity could introduce comparisons between very different areas of the total region that make little sense from a policy perspective \u2014 in effect, holding a farming community to the same standard as a dense, urbanized neighborhood.\n\nROA analysis for urban areas is based on census tract data. Since tracts in rural areas of are approximately 37 times larger in land area than tracts in non-rural areas, tract-level data in rural areas may mask over variation in opportunity and resources within these tracts. Assessing opportunity at the census block group level in rural areas reduces this difference by 90 percent (each rural tract contains three block groups), and thus allows for finer-grained analysis.\n\nIn addition, more consistent standards can be useful for identifying areas of concern from a fair housing perspective \u2014 such as high-poverty and racially segregated areas. Assessing these factors based on intraregional comparison could mischaracterize areas in more affluent areas with relatively even and equitable development opportunity patterns as high-poverty, and could generate misleading results in areas with higher shares of objectively poor neighborhoods by holding them to a lower, intraregional standard.\n\nTo avoid either outcome, the Task Force used a hybrid approach for the CTCAC/HCD ROA analysis \u2014 accounting for regional differences in assessing opportunity for most places, while applying more rigid standards for high-poverty, racially segregated areas in all regions. In particular:\n\nFiltering for High-Poverty, Racially Segregated Areas\nThe CTCAC/HCD ROA filters areas that meet consistent standards for both poverty (30% of the population below the federal poverty line) and racial segregation (over-representation of people of color relative to the county) into a \u201cHigh Segregation & Poverty\u201d category. The share of each region that falls into the High Segregation & Poverty category varies from region to region.\n\nCalculating Index Scores for Non-Filtered Areas\nThe CTCAC/HCD ROAs process calculates regionally derived opportunity index scores for non-filtered tracts and rural block groups using twenty-one indicators (see Data Quality section of metadata for more information). These index scores make it possible to sort each non-filtered tract or rural block group into opportunity categories according to their rank within the urban or rural areas.\n\nTo allow CTCAC and HCD to incentivize equitable development patterns in each region to the same degree, the CTCAC/HCD analysis 20 percent of tracts or rural block groups in each urban or rural area, respectively, with the highest relative index scores to the \"Highest Resource\u201d designation and the next 20 percent to the \u201cHigh Resource\u201d designation.\n\nThe region's urban area thus ends up with 40 percent of its total tracts with reliable data as Highest or High Resource (or 40 percent of block groups in the rural area). The remaining non-filtered tracts or rural block groups are then evenly divided into \u201cLow Resource\u201d and \u201cModerate Resource\u201d categories.\n\nExcluding Tracts or Block Groups\nThe analysis also excludes certain census areas from being categorized.

Calculated using a three-year moving average, PCI ranges from zero (failed) to 100 (brand-new) and has been used as a regional indicator of pavement preservation for over a decade.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nMetropolitan Transportation Commission: StreetSaver\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nPavement condition index (PCI) relies upon a three-year moving average for regional, county and city PCI to improve the reliability of the PCI data on an annual basis. The index ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 representing a failed road and 100 representing a brand-new facility. Segment PCI data is collected on a rolling basis but is imputed for interim years based on facility age and treatments using the MTC StreetSaver system. Pavement condition data was not collected in 2008. As such, 2007 and 2009 PCI scores were averaged to compute a 2008 estimate for the region, county and city datasets. Due to a lack of reported PCI data for the city of Palo Alto in 2007, an average could not be calculated, so Palo Alto is not included in the Regional Distribution chart.", "attribution": "MTC StreetSaver", "attribution_link": "https://www.streetsaver.com/", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-10-15T03:16:14.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-10-15T03:09:32.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-10-15T03:16:14.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-10-15T03:12:49.000Z", "columns_name": ["Source", "Region", "3YRAvgChange", "3YRAverage", "Year"], "columns_field_name": ["source", "region", "_3yravgchange", "_3yraverage", "year"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "Change in average pavement condition index between 2014-2017 and 2015-2018", "Average pavement condition index 2015-2018", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-10-15T03:12:49.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["infrastructure", "transportation", "demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/vys4-7jxj", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Street-Pavement-Condition-Bay-Area-Upd/vys4-7jxj", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

A permitted unit is a unit that a city or county has authorized for construction.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nConstruction Industry Research Board\nTable 3: Residential Units and Valuation (1967-2010)\nNo link available\n\nCalifornia Housing Foundation/Construction Industry Research Board\nCalifornia Construction Trends (2011-2013)\nhttp://www.mychf.org/cirb/\n\nAssociation of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) \u2013 Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC)\nHousing Permits Database (2014-2017)\nhttp://opendata.mtc.ca.gov\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nBay Area housing permits data prior to 2014 comes from the California Housing Foundation/Construction Industry Research Board. Data from 2014 to 2017 comes from the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) \u2013 Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) Housing Permits Database.\n\nSingle-family housing units include detached, semi-detached, row house and town house units. Row houses and town houses are included as single-family units when each unit is separated from the adjacent unit by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Condominiums are included as single-family units when they are of zero-lot-line or zero-property-line construction; when units are separated by an air space; or, when units are separated by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Multi-family housing includes duplexes, three-to-four-unit structures and apartment-type structures with five units or more. Multi-family also includes condominium units in structures of more than one living unit that do not meet the single-family housing definition. In the permits data from 2014 to 2017, single-family units include all units not strictly classified as multi-family. This may include secondary units.\n\nEach multi-family unit is counted separately even though they may be in the same building. Total units is the sum of single-family and multi-family units. County data is available from 1967 whereas city data is available from 1990. City data is only available for incorporated cities and towns. All permits in unincorporated cities and towns are included under their respective county\u2019s unincorporated total. Permit data is not available for years when the city or town was not incorporated.\n\nAffordable housing is the total number of permitted units affordable to low and very low income households. Housing affordable to very low income households are households making below 50% of the area median income. Housing affordable to low income households are households making between 50% and 80% of the area median income. Housing affordable to moderate income households are households making below 80% and 120% of the area median income. Housing affordable to above moderate income households are households making above 120% of the area median income.\n\nPermit data is missing for the following cities and years:\nClayton, 1990-2007\nLafayette, 1990-2007\nMoraga, 1990-2007\nOrinda, 1990-2007\nSan Ramon, 1990\n\nBuilding permit data for metropolitan areas for each year is the sum of non-seasonally adjusted monthly estimates from the Building Permit Survey. The Bay Area values are the sum of the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward MSA and the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara MSA. The counties included in these areas are: San Francisco, Marin, Contra Costa, Alameda, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and San Benito.\n\nPermit values reflect the number of units permitted in each respective year.", "attribution": "ABAG Housing Permit Database", "attribution_link": "http://housing.abag.ca.gov/#permits", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-03-11T22:22:56.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-10-31T21:53:13.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-03-11T22:22:56.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-03-11T22:21:14.000Z", "columns_name": ["Moderate_Share", "VeryLowunits", "Affordableunits_Share", "MF_Share", "County", "VeryLow_Share", "Affordableunits", "AboveModerateunits", "Moderateunits", "Low_Share", "TOTALunits", "MFunits", "SFunits", "Year", "AboveModerate_Share", "SF_Share", "Lowunits", "Source"], "columns_field_name": ["moderate_share", "verylowunits", "affordableunits_share", "mf_share", "county", "verylow_share", "affordableunits", "abovemoderateunits", "moderateunits", "low_share", "totalunits", "mfunits", "sfunits", "year", "abovemoderate_share", "sf_share", "lowunits", "source"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Share of units for which permits were issued that are affordable at 80% to 120% Area Median Income", "Number of units for which permits were issued affordable at below 50% Area Median Income", "Share of units for which permits were issued that are affordable at below 80% Area Median Income", "Share of units for which permits were issued that are multi-family units", "", "Share of units for which permits were issued that are affordable at below 50% Area Median Income ", "Number of units for which permits were issued that are affordable at below 80% Area Median Income", "Number of units for which permits were issued affordable at over 120% Area Median Income", "Number of units for which permits were issued affordable at 80% to 120% Area Median Income", "Share of units for which permits were issued that are affordable at 50% to 80% Area Median Income", "Total number of units for which permits were issued", "Number of multi-family units for which permits were issued", "Number of single-family units for which permits were issued", "", "Share of units for which permits were issued that are affordable at over 120% Area Median Income", "Share of units for which permits were issued that are single-family units", "Number of units for which permits were issued affordable at 50% to 80% Area Median Income", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-11-14T19:46:21.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["environment", "infrastructure", "housing & development"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/wbvu-rmp6", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Housing-Permits-Bay-Area/wbvu-rmp6", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

While a significant share of residents may choose to rent, home prices represent a primary driver of housing affordability in a given region, county or city.\t\n\nDATA SOURCE\nZillow\nMedian Sale Price (1997-2018)\nhttp://www.zillow.com/research/data/\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics: Consumer Price Index\nAll Urban Consumers Data Table (1997-2018; specific to each metro area)\nhttp://data.bls.gov\n\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nMedian housing price estimates for the region, counties, cities, and zip code come from analysis of individual home sales by Zillow. The median sale price is the price separating the higher half of the sales from the lower half. In other words, 50 percent of home sales are below or above the median value. Zillow defines all homes as single-family residential, condominium, and co-operative homes with a county record. Single-family residences are detached, which means the home is an individual structure with its own lot. Condominiums are units that you own in a multi-unit complex, such as an apartment building. Co-operative homes are slightly different from condominiums where the homeowners own shares in the corporation that owns the building, not the actual units themselves. \n\nFor metropolitan area comparison values, the Bay Area metro area\u2019s median home sale price is the population-weighted average of the nine counties\u2019 median home prices. Home sales prices are not reliably available for Houston, because Texas is a non-disclosure state. For more information on non-disclosure states, see: http://www.zillow.com/blog/chronicles-of-data-collection-ii-non-disclosure-states-3783/\n\nInflation-adjusted data are presented to illustrate how home prices have grown relative to overall price increases; that said, the use of the Consumer Price Index does create some challenges given the fact that housing represents a major chunk of consumer goods bundle used to calculate CPI.

The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, mode and operator tables for per-capita annual boardings (for an average resident in the given region or service area).\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE\r\nFederal Transit Administration: National Transit Database\r\nhttp://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION\r\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\r\nParatransit data is sparse in early years of the NTD dataset, meaning that transit ridership estimates in the early 1990s are likely underestimated. Simple modes were aggregated to combine the various bus modes (e.g. rapid bus, express bus, local bus) into a single mode to avoid incorrect conclusions resulting from mode recoding over the lifespan of NTD. \r\n\r\n2016 data should be considered preliminary, as it is derived from the monthly data tables rather than the longer-term time-series dataset. The unlinked passenger trips recorded in NTD's Monthly Module Adjusted Data Release database is used to calculate 2016 year-over-year change in ridership. The calculated 2016 growth rate is applied to the 2015 annual unlinked passenger trips recorded in the TS2.1 - Service Dta and Operating Expenses Time-Series by Mode to estimate 2016 ridership numbers. 2016 ridership estimates were not made for small operators that did not report monthly ridership numbers. For the Bay Area, this means 2016 ridership estimates are unavailable for Union City Transit (UCT) and Vacaville City Coach. Due to the omission of some small operators from 2016 estimates, regional and metro ridership numbers are likely slightly underestimated. Weekday ridership is calculated by taking the total annual ridership and dividing by 300, an assumption which is consistent with MTC travel modeling procedures; it was also compared to observed weekday boarding data (which is more limited in availability) to ensure consistency on the regional level. Per-capita transit ridership is calculated for the operator's general service area or taxation district; for example, BART includes the three core counties (San Francisco, Alameda, and Contra Costa) as well as northern San Mateo County post-SFO extension and AC Transit includes the cities located within its service area. ACE per-capita transit ridership is calculated using the population of Alameda and San Joaquin counties. For other metro areas, operators were identified by developing a list of all urbanized areas within a current MSA boundary and then using that UZA list to flag relevant operators; this means that all operators (both large and small) were included in the metro comparison data.", "attribution": "Federal Transit Administration: National Transit Database", "attribution_link": "http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2018-07-06T18:04:39.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-05-24T20:49:41.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-07-06T18:04:39.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-06-05T22:26:27.000Z", "columns_name": ["PerCapita_Annual_Boardings", "System_Full_Name", "Annual_Boardings", "System", "Population", "Source2", "Year", "Source1", "PercentChg_1991"], "columns_field_name": ["percapita_annual_boardings", "system_full_name", "annual_boardings", "system", "population", "source2", "year", "source1", "percentchg_1991"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Annual transit boardings per-capita (per resident of service area)", "", "Annual passenger boardings", "", "", "", "", "", "Percent change from 1991 ridership levels"], "columns_format": [{"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "1", "align": "right"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "0", "align": "right"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "0", "align": "right"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "4", "align": "right"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-06-05T22:28:37.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["transportation", "health", "economy"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/wdpr-f2dr", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Transit-Ridership-per-Capita-by-operat/wdpr-f2dr", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

Regional and local geographies rely on data collected by real Answers, a research organization and database publisher specializing in the multifamily housing market. real Answers focuses on collecting longitudinal data for individual rental properties through quarterly surveys. For the Bay Area, their database is comprised of properties with 40 to 3,000+ housing units. Median list prices most likely have an upward bias due to the exclusion of smaller properties. The bias may be most extreme in geographies where large rental properties represent a small portion of the overall rental market. A map of the individual properties surveyed is included in the Local Focus section. \r\n\r\nIndividual properties surveyed provided lower- and upper-bound ranges for the various types of housing available (studio, 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, etc.). Median lower- and upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the regional and county geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the average of the median lower- and upper-bound prices for the region and counties. Median upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the city geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the median upper-bound price for cities. For simplicity, only the mean list rent is displayed for the individual properties. The metro areas geography rely upon Zillow data, which is the median price for rentals listed through www.zillow.com during the month. Like the real Answers data, Zillow's median list prices most likely have an upward bias since small properties are underrepresented in Zillow's listings. The metro area data for the Bay Area cannot be compared to the regional Bay Area data. Due to afore mentioned data limitations, this data is suitable for analyzing the change in list rents over time but not necessarily comparisons of absolute list rents. Metro area boundaries reflects today\u2019s metro area definitions by county for consistency, rather than historical metro area boundaries.\r\n\r\nDue to the limited number of rental properties surveyed, city-level data is unavailable for Atherton, Belvedere, Brisbane, Calistoga, Clayton, Cloverdale, Cotati, Fairfax, Half Moon Bay, Healdsburg, Hillsborough, Los Altos Hills, Monte Sereno, Moranga, Oakley, Orinda, Portola Valley, Rio Vista, Ross, San Anselmo, San Carlos, Saratoga, Sebastopol, Windsor, Woodside, and Yountville.\r\n\r\nInflation-adjusted data are presented to illustrate how rents have grown relative to overall price increases; that said, the use of the Consumer Price Index does create some challenges given the fact that housing represents a major chunk of consumer goods bundle used to calculate CPI. This reflects a methodological tradeoff between precision and accuracy and is a common concern when working with any commodity that is a major component of CPI itself.  Percent change in inflation-adjusted median is calculated with respect to the median price from the fourth quarter or December of the base year.", "attribution": "real Answers", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2018-07-06T18:06:29.000Z", "createdAt": "2016-10-31T23:40:39.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-07-06T18:06:29.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2016-12-08T00:38:11.000Z", "columns_name": ["Latitude", "AverageRent", "County", "Source", "Longitude", "Structures", "Year Built", "Units", "Zipcode", "City", "Address", "Name", "Year"], "columns_field_name": ["latitude", "averagerent", "county", "source", "longitude", "structures", "year_built", "units", "zipcode", "city", "address", "name", "year"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "0", "align": "right"}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "rdf": "", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2016-12-08T00:40:08.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["finance", "health", "infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/wfp9-cb9q", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-List-Rents-by-property/wfp9-cb9q", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

Congestion is defined as speeds less than 35 mph, the level at which freeway throughput is maximized.

A Priority Development Area (PDA) is a locally-designated area with frequent transit service, where a jurisdiction has decided to concentrate most of its housing and jobs growth for development in the foreseeable future. PDA boundaries are current as of August 2019. For more information on PDA designation see http://gis.abag.ca.gov/website/PDAShowcase/.\n\nPopulation estimates for Bay Area counties and cities are from the California Department of Finance, which are as of January 1st of each year. Population estimates for non-Bay Area regions are from the U.S. Census Bureau. Decennial Census years reflect population as of April 1st of each year whereas population estimates for intercensal estimates are as of July 1st of each year. Population estimates for Bay Area tracts are from the decennial Census (1970 -2010) and the American Community Survey (2008-2012 5-year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average; 2013-2017 5-year rolling average). Estimates of population density for tracts use gross acres as the denominator.\n\nPopulation estimates for Bay Area PDAs are from the decennial Census (1970 - 2010) and the American Community Survey (2006-2010 5 year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average; 2013-2017 5-year rolling average). Population estimates for PDAs are derived from Census population counts at the tract level for 1970-1990 and at the block group level for 2000-2017. Population from either tracts or block groups are allocated to a PDA using an area ratio. For example, if a quarter of a Census block group lies with in a PDA, a quarter of its population will be allocated to that PDA. Tract-to-PDA and block group-to-PDA area ratios are calculated using gross acres. Estimates of population density for PDAs use gross acres as the denominator.\n\n\nAnnual population estimates for metropolitan areas outside the Bay Area are from the Census and are benchmarked to each decennial Census. The annual estimates in the 1990s were not updated to match the 2000 benchmark.\n\nThe following is a", "attribution": "U.S. Census Bureau", "attribution_link": "https://www.factfinder.census.gov", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2020-04-13T23:12:26.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-10-16T19:11:19.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-04-13T23:12:26.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2020-03-24T21:50:19.000Z", "columns_name": ["PercentChng_1970", "PopDensity", "PDA", "PDA_ID", "Acres", "Population", "Year", "Source1"], "columns_field_name": ["percentchng_1970", "popdensity", "pda", "pdaid", "acres", "population", "year", "source1"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Percent change in population since 1970", "Population density in residents per acre", "Priority Development Area name", "Priority Development Area ID", "Area in acres", "Population", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {"precision": "2"}, {}, {}, {}, {"precision": "0"}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-03-24T21:50:20.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "environment"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/whse-7rx6", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Population-by-PDA/whse-7rx6", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

The data reflect the median monthly rent paid by Bay Area households across apartments and homes of various sizes and various levels of quality. This differs from advertised rents for available apartments, which usually are higher. Note that rent can be presented using nominal or real (inflation-adjusted) dollar values; data are presented inflation-adjusted to reflect changes in household purchasing power over time.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census - https://nhgis.org  \nCount 2 (1970)  \nForm STF1 (1980-1990)  \nForm SF3a (2000)\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey - https://data.census.gov/  \nForm B25058 (2005-2021; median contract rent)\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics: Consumer Price Index - https://www.bls.gov/data/  \n1970-2021\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nRent data reflects median rent payments rather than list rents (refer to measure definition above). American Community Survey 1-year data is used for larger geographies \u2013 Bay counties and most metropolitan area counties \u2013 while smaller geographies rely upon 5-year rolling average data due to their smaller sample sizes. Note that 2020 data uses the 5-year estimates because the ACS did not collect 1-year data for 2020.\n\n1970 Census data for median rent payments has been imputed from quintiles using methodology from California Department of Finance as the source data only provided the mean, rather than the median, monthly rent. Metro area boundaries reflects today\u2019s metro area definitions by county for consistency, rather than historical metro area boundaries.\n\nInflation-adjusted data are presented to illustrate how rent payments have grown relative to overall price increases; that said, the use of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) does create some challenges given the fact that housing represents a major chunk of consumer goods bundle used to calculate CPI.

Row houses and town houses are included as single-family units when each unit is separated from the adjacent unit by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Condominiums are included as single-family units when they are of zero-lot-line or zero-property-line construction; when units are separated by an air space; or, when units are separated by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Multi-family housing includes duplexes, three-to-four-unit structures and apartment-type structures with five units or more. Multi-family also includes condominium units in structures of more than one living unit that do not meet the single-family housing definition.\n\nEach multi-family unit is counted separately even though they may be in the same building. Total units is the sum of single-family and multi-family units. County data is available from 1967 whereas city data is available from 1990. City data is only available for incorporated cities and towns. All permits in unincorporated cities and towns are included under their respective county\u2019s unincorporated total. Permit data is not available for years when the city or town was not incorporated.\n\nAffordable housing is the total number of permitted units affordable to low and very low income households. Housing affordable to very low income households are households making below 50% of the area median income. Housing affordable to low income households are households making between 50% and 80% of the area median income. Housing affordable to moderate income households are households making below 80% and 120% of the area median income. Housing affordable to above moderate income households are households making above 120% of the area median income.\n\nPermit data is missing for the following cities and years:  \nClayton, 1990-2007  \nLafayette, 1990-2007  \nMoraga, 1990-2007  \nOrinda, 1990-2007  \nSan Ramon, 1990\n\nBuilding permit data for metropolitan areas for each year is the sum of non-seasonally adjusted monthly estimates from the Census Building Permit Survey.

The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional and county tables for per-capita vehicle miles traveled.\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE\r\nCalifornia Department of Transportation: California Public Road Data/Highway Performance Monitoring System\r\n2001-2015\r\nhttp://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/tsip/hpms/datalibrary.php\r\n\r\nCalifornia Department of Finance: Population and Housing Estimates\r\nForms E-8 and E-5\r\n2001-2015\r\nhttp://www.dof.ca.gov/research/demographic/reports/estimates/e-8/\r\nhttp://www.dof.ca.gov/research/demographic/reports/estimates/e-5/2011-20/view.php\r\n\r\nU.S. Census Bureau: Summary File 1\r\n2010\r\nhttp://factfinder2.census.gov\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION\r\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\r\nVehicle miles traveled reflects the mileage accrued within the county and not necessarily the residents of that county; even though most trips are due to local residents, additional VMT can be accrued by through-trips. City data was thus discarded due to this limitation and the analysis only examine county and regional data, where through-trips are generally less common.\r\n\r\nThe metropolitan area comparison was performed by summing all of the urbanized areas within each metropolitan area (9-nine region for the San Francisco Bay Area and the primary MSA for all others). For the metro analysis, no VMT data is available outside of other urbanized areas; it is only available for intraregional analysis purposes.\r\n\r\nVMT per capita is calculated by dividing VMT by an estimate of the traveling population. The traveling population does not include people living in institutionalized facilities, which are defined by the Census. Because institutionalized population is not estimated each year, the proportion of people living in institutionalized facilities from the 2010 Census was applied to the total population estimates for all years.", "attribution": "California Department of Transportation", "attribution_link": "http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/tsip/hpms/datalibrary.php", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2018-07-06T18:04:21.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-03-10T02:38:29.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-07-06T18:04:21.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-07-21T21:29:31.000Z", "columns_name": ["Region", "Source2", "Source1", "VMTpc", "Population_adj", "Population", "VMT", "Year"], "columns_field_name": ["region", "source2", "source1", "vmtpc", "population_adj", "population", "vmt", "year"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Area in which vehicle-miles are traveled\n", "", "", "Daily vehicle miles traveled (per-capita)\n", "Adjusted population (subtracting out institutionalized population)", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "1", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-07-21T21:29:54.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "transportation", "public safety"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/wsse-e9tk", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Daily-Miles-Traveled-Bay-Area-per-capi/wsse-e9tk", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

While \u201cat risk\u201d households may not necessarily be displaced in the short-term or long-term, neighborhoods identified as being \u201cat risk\u201d signify pressure as reflected by the decline in lower-income households (who are presumed to relocate to other more affordable communities).

Historical data is pulled from U.S. Census datasets and aligned with today\u2019s census tract boundaries using crosswalk tables provided by LTDB. Tract data, as well as regional income data, are calculated using 5-year rolling averages for consistency \u2013 given that tract data is only available on a 5-year basis. Using household tables by income level, the number of households in each tract falling below the median are summed, which involves summing all brackets below the regional median and then summing a fractional share of the bracket that includes the regional median (assuming a simple linear distribution within that bracket).\n\nOnce all tracts in a given county or metro area are synced to today\u2019s boundaries, the analysis identifies census tracts of greater than 500 lower-income people (in the prior year) to filter out low-population areas. For those tracts, any net loss between the prior year and the analysis year results in that tract being flagged as being at risk of displacement, and all lower-income households in that tract are flagged. To calculate the share of households at risk, the number of lower-income households living in flagged tracts are summed and divided by the total number of lower-income households living in the larger geography (county or metro). Minor deviations on a year-to-year basis should be taken in context, given that data on the tract level often fluctuates and has a significant margin of error; changes on the county and regional level are more appropriate to consider on an annual basis instead.", "attribution": "U.S. Census Bureau", "attribution_link": "http://api.census.gov", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-08-13T16:05:02.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-12-12T22:47:20.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-08-13T16:05:02.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2018-12-12T22:50:32.000Z", "columns_name": ["Source3", "LIHH_At_Risk", "LIHH_Total", "Source2", "Year", "Source1", "Metro", "Displacement_Risk"], "columns_field_name": ["source3", "lihh_at_risk", "lihh_total", "source2", "year", "source1", "metro", "displacement_risk"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "Number of lower-income households at risk of displacement", "Total number of lower-income households", "", "", "", "", "Share of lower-income households at risk of displacement"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-12-12T22:50:33.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "infrastructure", "environment"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/wx2e-8w6i", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Displacement-Risk-by-metro/wx2e-8w6i", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

Covered employees in the private-sector and in the state and local government include most corporate officials, all executives, all supervisory personnel, all professionals, all clerical workers, many farmworkers, all wage earners, all piece workers and all part-time workers. Workers on paid sick leave, paid holiday, paid vacation and the like are also covered.\n\nBesides excluding the aforementioned national security agencies, QCEW excludes proprietors, the unincorporated self-employed, unpaid family members, certain farm and domestic workers exempted from having to report employment data and railroad workers covered by the railroad unemployment insurance system. Excluded as well are workers who earned no wages during the entire applicable pay period because of work stoppages, temporary layoffs, illness or unpaid vacations. \n\nFor measuring jobs below the county level, Vital Signs assigns collections of incorporated cities and towns to sub-county areas. For example, the cities of East Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Portola Valley, Redwood City and Woodside are considered South San Mateo County. Because Bay Area counties differ in footprint, the number of cities included in a sub-county is one for San Francisco and San Jose and more than one for all other sub-counties.

To allow for historical comparisons, the Census Bureau merges housing expenditure brackets into three consistent bins (less than 20 percent, 20 percent to 34 percent, and more than 35 percent) that work for all years. The highest income bracket for renters in the ACS data was $100,000 or more, while the homeowner dataset included brackets for $100,000 to $149,999 and $150,000 and above. These brackets were merged together to allow for uniform comparison across tenure. While some studies use 30 percent as the affordability threshold, Vital Signs uses 35 percent as this is the closest break point using the standardized affordability brackets above. Historical data for Napa County is unavailable due to an insufficient sample size for renters in a number of years, making it impossible to calculate affordability for all households. All ACS data is for a single year, rather than a rolling average.

The footprint is defined as land occupied by structures with building density of at least 1 unit to 1.5 acres. Uses include residential, industrial, commercial, construction, institutional, public administration, railroad and other transportation yards, cemeteries, airports, golf courses, sanitary landfills, sewage treatment, water control structures, and other developed purposes.\n\nTo determine the amount of greenfield development (in acres) occurring in a given two-year period, the differences in urban footprint are computed on a county-level. FMMP makes slight refinements to urban boundaries over time, so changes in urban footprint +/- 100 acres are not regionally significant. The GIS shapefile represents the 2016 urban footprint and thus does not show previously urbanized land outside of the footprint (i.e. Hamilton Air Force Base).\n\nFor metro comparisons, a different methodology had to be used to avoid the geospatial limitations associated with FMMP. U.S. Census population by census block group was gathered for each metro area for 2000, 2010, and 2017. Population data for years 2000 and 2010 come from the Decennial Census while data for 2018 comes from the 2017 5-year American Community Survey. The block group was considered urbanized if its average/gross density was greater than 1 housing unit per acre (a slightly higher threshold than FMMP uses for its definition). Because a block group cannot be flagged as partially urbanized, and non-residential uses are not fully captured, the urban footprint of the region calculated with this methodology is smaller than in FMMP. The metro data should be primarily used for looking at comparative growth rate in greenfield development rather than the acreage totals themselves.", "attribution": "Farmland Mapping & Monitoring Program", "attribution_link": "https://www.conservation.ca.gov/dlrp/fmmp", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2020-07-03T16:36:18.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-11-14T20:48:13.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-07-03T16:36:18.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-11-15T22:36:27.000Z", "columns_name": ["Share_of_Region_Change_2010", "Year", "Share_of_Region_Change_2000", "Change_Urban_Acres_2010", "Change_Urban_Acres_2000", "Change_Urban_Acres_1990", "Urban_Acres", "County", "Share_of_Region_Change_1990", "Source"], "columns_field_name": ["share_of_region_change_2010", "year", "share_of_region_change_2000", "change_urban_acres_2010", "change_urban_acres_2000", "change_urban_acres_1990", "urban_acres", "county", "share_of_region_change_1990", "source"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Share of regional change in urbanized acres since 2010", "", "Share of regional change in urbanized acres since 2000", "Percent change in urbanized acres since 2010", "Percent change in urbanized acres since 2000", "Percent change in urbanized acres since 1990", "Number of urbanized acres", "", "Share of regional change in urbanized acres since 1990", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-11-14T20:50:21.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["environment", "demographics", "infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/x8pj-558q", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Greenfield-Development-by-county/x8pj-558q", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

For the decennial Census datasets, the breakdown of auto commuters between drive alone and carpool is not available before 1980. American Community Survey 1-year data is used for larger geographies \u2013 Bay counties and most metropolitan area counties \u2013 while smaller geographies rely upon 5-year rolling average data due to their smaller sample sizes. This will result in discrepancies in cases like San Francisco where it is both a city and a county. Note that 2020 data uses the 5-year estimates because the ACS did not collect 1-year data for 2020. Additionally, for the County by place of residence breakdown, Napa was missing ACS 1-Year commute mode choice data for all modes for 2007, 2008, 2011 and 2021. 5-Year estimates were used to fill the missing data for 2011 and 2021, but not 2007 or 2008 since the 5-Year estimates start in 2009.\n\nRegional mode shares are population-weighted averages of the nine counties' modal shares. \"Auto\" includes drive alone and carpool for the simple data tables and is broken out in the detailed data tables accordingly, as it was not available before 1980. \"Transit\" includes public operators (Muni, BART, etc.) and employer-provided shuttles (e.g., Google shuttle buses). \"Other\" includes motorcycle, taxi, and other modes of transportation; bicycle mode share was broken out separately for the first time in the 2006 data and is shown in the detailed data tables. Census tract data is not available for tracts with insufficient numbers of residents or workers.\n\nThe metropolitan area comparison was performed for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area in addition to the primary metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) for other major metropolitan areas.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-20T17:13:58.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-07-08T00:23:55.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-20T17:13:58.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-09-23T22:04:26.000Z", "columns_name": ["Share", "Mode", "Year", "County", "Source", "Data_Type"], "columns_field_name": ["share", "mode", "year", "county", "source", "data_type"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-07-08T00:23:57.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/xcep-e2qd", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Commute-Mode-Choice-by-Place-of-Employ/xcep-e2qd", "owner": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}, "creator": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}}

To allow for historical comparisons, the Census Bureau merges housing expenditure brackets into three consistent bins (less than 20 percent, 20 percent to 34 percent, and more than 35 percent) that work for all years. The highest income bracket for renters in the ACS data was $100,000 or more, while the homeowner dataset included brackets for $100,000 to $149,999 and $150,000 and above. These brackets were merged together to allow for uniform comparison across tenure. While some studies use 30 percent as the affordability threshold, Vital Signs uses 35 percent as this is the closest break point using the standardized affordability brackets above.

{"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Poverty - by tract (2022)", "id": "xciv-yzma", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR  \nPoverty (EQ5)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME  \nThe share of the population living in households that earn less than 200 percent of the federal poverty limit\n\nLAST UPDATED  \nJanuary 2023\n\nDESCRIPTION  \nPoverty refers to the share of the population living in households that earn less than 200 percent of the federal poverty limit, which varies based on the number of individuals in a given household. It reflects the number of individuals who are economically struggling due to low household income levels.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nU.S Census Bureau: Decennial Census - http://www.nhgis.org  \n1980-2000\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey - https://data.census.gov/  \n2007-2021  \nForm C17002\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nThe U.S. Census Bureau defines a national poverty level (or household income) that varies by household size, number of children in a household, and age of householder. The national poverty level does not vary geographically even though cost of living is different across the United States. For the Bay Area, where cost of living is high and incomes are correspondingly high, an appropriate poverty level is 200% of poverty or twice the national poverty level, consistent with what was used for past equity work at MTC and ABAG. For comparison, however, both the national and 200% poverty levels are presented. \n\nFor Vital Signs, the poverty rate is defined as the number of people (including children) living below twice the poverty level divided by the number of people for whom poverty status is determined. The household income definitions for poverty change each year to reflect inflation. The official poverty definition uses money income before taxes and does not include capital gains or non-cash benefits (such as public housing, Medicaid and food stamps). \n\nFor the national poverty level definitions by year, see: US Census Bureau Poverty Thresholds - https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html.\n\nFor an explanation on how the Census Bureau measures poverty, see: How the Census Bureau Measures Poverty - https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/poverty/guidance/poverty-measures.html.\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS) 1-year data is used for larger geographies \u2013 Bay counties and most metropolitan area counties \u2013 while smaller geographies rely upon 5-year rolling average data due to their smaller sample sizes. Note that 2020 data uses the 5-year estimates because the ACS did not collect 1-year data for 2020.\n\nTo be consistent across metropolitan areas, the poverty definition for non-Bay Area metros is twice the national poverty level. Data were not adjusted for varying income and cost of living levels across the metropolitan areas.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-13T17:54:42.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-06-10T20:05:56.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-13T17:54:42.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-01-03T18:50:39.000Z", "columns_name": ["PovPCT200", "City", "PovPCT100", "Pov100", "PovPop", "Year", "County", "Tract", "Source", "Pov200"], "columns_field_name": ["povpct200", "city", "povpct100", "pov100", "povpop", "year", "county", "tract", "source", "pov200"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-11-10T20:53:15.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/xciv-yzma", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Poverty-by-tract-2022-/xciv-yzma", "owner": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}, "creator": {"id": "eqr7-5uwb", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kaya Tollas"}}

A permitted unit is a unit that a city or county has authorized for construction.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nCalifornia Housing Foundation/Construction Industry Research Board (CIRB) - https://www.cirbreport.org/  \nConstruction Review report (1967-2022)\n\nAssociation of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) \u2013 Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) - https://data.bayareametro.gov/Development/HCD-Annual-Progress-Report-Jurisdiction-Summary/nxbj-gfv7  \nHousing Permits Database (2014-2021)\n\nCensus Bureau Building Permit Survey - https://www2.census.gov/econ/bps/County/  \nBuilding permits by county (annual, monthly)\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nBay Area housing permits data by single/multi family come from the California Housing Foundation/Construction Industry Research Board (CIRB). Affordability breakdowns from 2014 to 2021 come from the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) \u2013 Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) Housing Permits Database.\n\nSingle-family housing units include detached, semi-detached, row house and town house units. Row houses and town houses are included as single-family units when each unit is separated from the adjacent unit by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Condominiums are included as single-family units when they are of zero-lot-line or zero-property-line construction; when units are separated by an air space; or, when units are separated by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Multi-family housing includes duplexes, three-to-four-unit structures and apartment-type structures with five units or more. Multi-family also includes condominium units in structures of more than one living unit that do not meet the single-family housing definition.\n\nEach multi-family unit is counted separately even though they may be in the same building. Total units is the sum of single-family and multi-family units. County data is available from 1967 whereas city data is available from 1990. City data is only available for incorporated cities and towns. All permits in unincorporated cities and towns are included under their respective county\u2019s unincorporated total. Permit data is not available for years when the city or town was not incorporated.\n\nAffordable housing is the total number of permitted units affordable to low and very low income households. Housing affordable to very low income households are households making below 50% of the area median income. Housing affordable to low income households are households making between 50% and 80% of the area median income. Housing affordable to moderate income households are households making below 80% and 120% of the area median income. Housing affordable to above moderate income households are households making above 120% of the area median income.\n\nPermit data is missing for the following cities and years:  \nClayton, 1990-2007  \nLafayette, 1990-2007  \nMoraga, 1990-2007  \nOrinda, 1990-2007  \nSan Ramon, 1990\n\nBuilding permit data for metropolitan areas for each year is the sum of non-seasonally adjusted monthly estimates from the Census Building Permit Survey. The Bay Area values are the sum of the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward MSA and the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara MSA.

In the Bay Area, ozone is measured by over a dozen monitoring stations that record hourly concentrations used to determine compliance with national standards. These hourly data are used to calculate eight-hour peak ozone levels for the fourth-worst day of the year, the most common indicator of ozone performance. This dataset includes regional and sensor-specific concentrations, as well as metropolitan area data.\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE\r\nBay Area Air Quality Management District\r\n1970-2016\r\nAir Quality Sensor Data\r\nhttp://www.baaqmd.gov/about-air-quality/air-quality-summaries\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION\r\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\r\nData is collected at specific sensor sites operated by the Air District that capture the concentration of ozone in the air; sensor locations may change over the years and thus only minor relocations are shown as the same station in this analysis (e.g., sensor moved across the street from its prior location). Data are used to calculate the 8-hour peak concentration for ozone. The fourth-highest day of the year is identified and then reported as a three-year rolling average to minimize noise associated with any given year. These averaged are compared to the national air quality standard to determine compliance. The worst location site may shift from year to year depending on which sensor location had the highest levels of ozone over that particular time period.", "attribution": "Bay Area Air Quality Management District", "attribution_link": "http://www.baaqmd.gov/about-air-quality/air-quality-summaries", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2018-07-06T18:04:30.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-06-23T21:27:28.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-07-06T18:04:30.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-06-23T21:28:52.000Z", "columns_name": ["Ozone_Max4_Daily_8HR_ppb_Annual_3YR_Standard", "Year", "Ozone_Max4_Daily_8HR_ppb_WorstLocation_3YR", "Ozone_Max4_Daily_8HR_ppb_WorstLocation_1YR", "Ozone_Max4_Daily_8HR_ppb_Annual_3YR", "Source", "Ozone_Max4_Daily_8HR_ppb_Annual_1YR", "Region"], "columns_field_name": ["ozone_max4_daily_8hr_ppb_annual_3yr_standard", "year", "ozone_max4_daily_8hr_ppb_worstlocation_3yr", "ozone_max4_daily_8hr_ppb_worstlocation_1yr", "ozone_max4_daily_8hr_ppb_annual_3yr", "source", "ozone_max4_daily_8hr_ppb_annual_1yr", "region"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Ozone concentrations (8-hour peak) - 4th worst day of year; 3-year rolling average (in parts per billion); standard set by EPA", "", "Ozone concentrations (8-hour peak) - 4th worst day of year; 3-year rolling average (in parts per billion); worst sensor location in region\n", "Ozone concentrations (8-hour peak) - 4th worst day of year; 1-year (in parts per billion); worst sensor location in region", "Ozone concentrations (8-hour peak) - 4th worst day of year; 3-year rolling average (in parts per billion)\n", "", "Ozone concentrations (8-hour peak) - 4th worst day of year; 1-year (in parts per billion)\n", ""], "columns_format": [{"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "1", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "1", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "1", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "1", "align": "right"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "1", "align": "right"}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-06-23T21:30:05.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "environment"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/xnph-99g9", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Ozone-Concentrations-Bay-Area-updated-/xnph-99g9", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

ACS 1-year data is used for larger geographies \u2013 Bay counties and most metropolitan area counties \u2013 while smaller geographies rely upon 5-year rolling average data due to their smaller sample sizes. Note that 2020 data uses the 5-year estimates because the ACS did not collect 1-year data for 2020.\n\nQuintile income for 1970-2000 is imputed from decennial Census data using methodology from the California Department of Finance. Bay Area income is the population weighted average of county-level income.\n\nIncome has been inflated using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for 2021 specific to each metro area; however, some metro areas lack metro-specific CPI data back to 1970 and therefore adjusted data uses national CPI for 1970.

Life expectancy does not reflect how long any given individual is expected to live; rather, it is an artificial measure that captures an aspect of the mortality rates across a population that can be compared across time and populations. More information about the determinants of life expectancy that may lead to differences in life expectancy between neighborhoods can be found in the Bay Area Regional Health Inequities Initiative (BARHII) Health Inequities in the Bay Area report at http://www.barhii.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/barhii_hiba.pdf.  Vital Signs measures life expectancy at birth (as opposed to cohort life expectancy). A statistical model was used to estimate life expectancy for Bay Area counties and ZIP Codes based on current life tables which require both age and mortality data. A life table is a table which shows, for each age, the survivorship of a people from a certain population.\r\n\r\nCurrent life tables were created using death records and population estimates by age. The California Department of Public Health provided death records based on the California death certificate information. Records include age at death and residential ZIP Code. Single-year age population estimates at the regional- and county-level comes from the California Department of Finance population estimates and projections for ages 0-100+. Population estimates for ages 100 and over are aggregated to a single age interval. Using this data, death rates in a population within age groups for a given year are computed to form unabridged life tables (as opposed to abridged life tables). To calculate life expectancy, the probability of dying between the jth and (j+1)st birthday is assumed uniform after age 1. Special consideration is taken to account for infant mortality.\r\n\r\nFor the ZIP Code-level life expectancy calculation, it is assumed that postal ZIP Codes share the same boundaries as ZIP Code Census Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs). More information on the relationship between ZIP Codes and ZCTAs can be found at http://www.census.gov/geo/reference/zctas.html. ZIP Code-level data uses three years of mortality data to make robust estimates due to small sample size. Year 2013 ZIP Code life expectancy estimates reflects death records from 2011 through 2013. 2013 is the last year with available mortality data. Death records for ZIP Codes with zero population (like those associated with P.O. Boxes) were assigned to the nearest ZIP Code with population. ZIP Code population for 2000 estimates comes from the Decennial Census. ZIP Code population for 2013 estimates are from the American Community Survey (5-Year Average). ACS estimates are adjusted using Decennial Census data for more accurate population estimates. An adjustment factor was calculated using the ratio between the 2010 Decennial Census population estimates and the 2012 ACS 5-Year (with middle year 2010) population estimates.

Regional and local geographies rely on data collected by real Answers, a research organization and database publisher specializing in the multifamily housing market. real Answers focuses on collecting longitudinal data for individual rental properties through quarterly surveys. For the Bay Area, their database is comprised of properties with 40 to 3,000+ housing units. Median list prices most likely have an upward bias due to the exclusion of smaller properties. The bias may be most extreme in geographies where large rental properties represent a small portion of the overall rental market. A map of the individual properties surveyed is included in the Local Focus section. \r\n\r\nIndividual properties surveyed provided lower- and upper-bound ranges for the various types of housing available (studio, 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, etc.). Median lower- and upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the regional and county geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the average of the median lower- and upper-bound prices for the region and counties. Median upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the city geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the median upper-bound price for cities. For simplicity, only the mean list rent is displayed for the individual properties. The metro areas geography rely upon Zillow data, which is the median price for rentals listed through www.zillow.com during the month. Like the real Answers data, Zillow's median list prices most likely have an upward bias since small properties are underrepresented in Zillow's listings. The metro area data for the Bay Area cannot be compared to the regional Bay Area data. Due to afore mentioned data limitations, this data is suitable for analyzing the change in list rents over time but not necessarily comparisons of absolute list rents. Metro area boundaries reflects today\u2019s metro area definitions by county for consistency, rather than historical metro area boundaries.\r\n\r\nDue to the limited number of rental properties surveyed, city-level data is unavailable for Atherton, Belvedere, Brisbane, Calistoga, Clayton, Cloverdale, Cotati, Fairfax, Half Moon Bay, Healdsburg, Hillsborough, Los Altos Hills, Monte Sereno, Moranga, Oakley, Orinda, Portola Valley, Rio Vista, Ross, San Anselmo, San Carlos, Saratoga, Sebastopol, Windsor, Woodside, and Yountville.\r\n\r\nInflation-adjusted data are presented to illustrate how rents have grown relative to overall price increases; that said, the use of the Consumer Price Index does create some challenges given the fact that housing represents a major chunk of consumer goods bundle used to calculate CPI. This reflects a methodological tradeoff between precision and accuracy and is a common concern when working with any commodity that is a major component of CPI itself.  Percent change in inflation-adjusted median is calculated with respect to the median price from the fourth quarter or December of the base year.", "attribution": "real Answers", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2018-07-06T18:06:24.000Z", "createdAt": "2016-11-19T22:00:48.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-07-06T18:06:24.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2016-11-19T22:00:55.000Z", "columns_name": ["Median_List_Rent_IA_PercentChg_1994", "Median_List_Rent_PercentChg_1994", "Median_List_Rent_IA", "Median_List_Rent", "Year", "Metro", "Source"], "columns_field_name": ["median_list_rent_ia_percentchg_1994", "median_list_rent_percentchg_1994", "median_list_rent_ia", "median_list_rent", "year", "metro", "source"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "4", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "4", "align": "right"}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2016-11-19T22:03:19.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["finance", "health", "infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/y3f9-8xmx", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-List-Rents-Bay-Area/y3f9-8xmx", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

This measure reflects the changing industry trends that affect our region\u2019s workers.\n\nDATA SOURCE  \nBureau of Labor Statistics, Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) - https://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm  \n1990-2021  \n\nCONTACT INFORMATION  \nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)  \nQuarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) employment data is reported by the place of work and represent the number of covered workers who worked during, or received pay for, the pay period that included the 12th day of the month. Covered employees in the private-sector and in the state and local government include most corporate officials, all executives, all supervisory personnel, all professionals, all clerical workers, many farmworkers, all wage earners, all piece workers and all part-time workers. Workers on paid sick leave, paid holiday, paid vacation and the like are also covered.\n\nBesides excluding the aforementioned national security agencies, QCEW excludes proprietors, the unincorporated self-employed, unpaid family members, certain farm and domestic workers exempted from having to report employment data and railroad workers covered by the railroad unemployment insurance system. Excluded as well are workers who earned no wages during the entire applicable pay period because of work stoppages, temporary layoffs, illness or unpaid vacations. \n\nThe location quotient (LQ) is used to evaluate level of concentration or clustering of an industry within the Bay Area and within each county of the region. A location quotient greater than 1 means there is a strong concentration for of jobs in an industry sector. For the Bay Area, the LQ is calculated as the share of the region\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of California's employment in that same sector. For each county, the LQ is calculated as the share of the county\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the region\u2019s employment in that same sector.\n\nData is mainly pulled from aggregation level 73, which is county-level summarized at the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) supersector level (12 sectors). This aggregation level exhibits the least loss due to data suppression, in the magnitude of 1-2 percent for regional employment, and is therefore preferred. However, the supersectors group together NAICS 11 Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting; NAICS 21 Mining and NAICS 23 Construction. To provide a separate tally of Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting, the aggregation level 74 data was used for NAICS codes 11, 21 and 23. \n\nQCEW reports on employment in Public Administration as NAICS 92. However, many government activities are reported with an industry specific code - such as transportation or utilities even if those may be public governmental entities. In 2021 for the Bay Area, the largest industry groupings under public ownership are Education and health services (58%); Public administration (29%) and Trade, transportation, and utilities (29%). With the exception of Education and health services, all other public activities were coded as government/public administration, regardless of industry group.\n\nFor the county data there were some industries that reported 0 jobs or did not report jobs at the desired aggregation/NAICS level for the following counties/years:\n\nFarm:  \n(aggregation level: 74, NAICS code: 11)\n- Contra Costa: 2008-2010\n- Marin: 1990-2006, 2008-2010, 2014-2020\n- Napa: 1990-2004, 2013-2021\n- San Francisco: 2019-2020\n- San Mateo: 2013\n\nInformation:  \n(aggregation level: 73, NAICS code: 51)\n- Solano: 2001\n\nFinancial Activities:  \n(aggregatio", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-13T17:54:05.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-06-10T00:59:23.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-13T17:54:05.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-07-06T20:51:17.000Z", "columns_name": ["industry_name", "Source", "Objectid", "Geo_Name", "Year", "Industry", "Difference_1990", "Percentchange_1990"], "columns_field_name": ["industry_name", "source", "objectid", "geo_name", "year", "industry", "difference_1990", "percentchange_1990"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "Source", "objectid", "geo_name", "Year", "Industry", "difference_1990", "percentchange_1990"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-07-06T20:30:43.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Economy", "domain_tags": ["ec1", "vital signs", "vital signs 2.0"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/y9r8-pr4c", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/Economy/Vital-Signs-Change-in-Jobs-by-Industry-Bay-Area-20/y9r8-pr4c", "owner": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}, "creator": {"id": "43ws-93gp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Aksel"}}

In the San Francisco Bay Area, low-wage occupations have a median hourly wage of less than 80% of the regional median wage; median wages for middle-wage occupations range from 80% to 120% of the regional median wage, and high-wage occupations have a median hourly wage above 120% of the regional median wage.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nCalifornia Employment Development Department OES\n(2001-2017)\nhttp://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov/data/oes-employment-and-wages.html\n\nAmerican Community Survey\n(2001-2017)\nhttp://api.census.gov\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nJobs are determined to be low-, middle-, or high-wage based on the median hourly wage of their occupational classification in the most recent year. Low-wage jobs are those that pay below 80% of the regional median wage. Middle-wage jobs are those that pay between 80% and 120% of the regional median wage. High-wage jobs are those that pay above 120% of the regional median wage. Regional median hourly wages are estimated from the American Community Survey and are published on the Vital Signs Income indicator page. For the national context analysis, occupation wage classifications are unique to each metro area. A low-wage job in New York, for instance, may be a middle-wage job in Miami. For the Bay Area in 2017, the median hourly wage for low-wage occupations was less than $20.86 per hour. For middle-wage jobs, the median ranged from $20.86 to $31.30 per hour; and for high-wage jobs, the median wage was above $31.30 per hour.\n\nOccupational employment and wage information comes from the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) program. Regional and subregional data is published by the California Employment Development Department. Metro data is published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The OES program collects data on wage and salary workers in nonfarm establishments to produce employment and wage estimates for some 800 occupations. Data from non-incorporated self-employed persons are not collected, and are not included in these estimates. Wage estimates represent a three-year rolling average.\n\nDue to changes in reporting during the analysis period, subregion data from the EDD OES have been aggregated to produce geographies that can be compared over time. West Bay is San Mateo, San Francisco, and Marin counties. North Bay is Sonoma, Solano and Napa counties. East Bay is Alameda and Contra Costa counties. South Bay is Santa Clara County from 2001-2004 and Santa Clara and San Benito counties from 2005-2017.\n\nDue to changes in occupation classifications during the analysis period, all occupations have been reassigned to 2010 SOC codes. For pre-2009 reporting years, all employment in occupations that were split into two or more 2010 SOC occupations are assigned to the first 2010 SOC occupation listed in the crosswalk table provided by the Census Bureau. This method assumes these occupations always fall in the same wage category, and sensitivity analysis of this reassignment method shows this is true in most cases.\n\nIn order to use OES data for time series analysis, several steps were taken to handle missing wage or employment data. For some occupations, such as airline pilots and flight attendants, no wage information was provided and these were removed from the analysis. Other occupations did not record a median hourly wage (mostly due to irregular work hours) but did record an annual average wage. Nearly all these occupations were in education (i.e. teachers). In this case, a 2080 hour-work year was assumed and [annual average wage/2080] was used as a proxy for median income. Most of these occupations were classified as high-wage, thus dispelling c", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-10-25T20:41:25.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-01-18T18:05:32.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-10-25T20:41:25.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-01-18T18:06:49.000Z", "columns_name": ["Jobs_Share", "Subregion", "Source", "Wage_Category", "Year", "OES_Jobs"], "columns_field_name": ["jobs_share", "subregion", "source", "wage_category", "year", "oes_jobs"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Share of jobs by wage category", "", "", "Wage categorization (low, middle, high)", "", "Number of jobs by wage category"], "columns_format": [{"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}, {}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-01-18T18:06:50.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["economy", "demographics", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/yc3r-a4rh", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Jobs-by-Wage-Level-Subregion/yc3r-a4rh", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}

{"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Jobs by Industry (Location Quotient) \u2013 Bay Area", "id": "ysen-ajs2", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nJobs by Industry (EC1)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nEmployment by place of work by industry sector\n\nLAST UPDATED\nJuly 2019\n\nDESCRIPTION\nJobs by industry refers to both the change in employment levels by industry and the proportional mix of jobs by economic sector. This measure reflects the changing industry trends that affect our region\u2019s workers.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nBureau of Labor Statistics: Current Employment Statistics\n1990-2017\nhttp://data.bls.gov\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nThe California Employment Development Department (EDD) provides estimates of employment by place of work and by industry. Industries are classified by their North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Vital Signs aggregates employment into 11 industry sectors: Farm, Mining, Logging and Construction, Manufacturing, Trade, Transportation and Utilities, Information, Financial Activities, Professional and Business Services, Educational and Health Services, Leisure and Hospitality, Government, and Other. EDD counts all public-sector jobs under Government, including public transportation, public schools, and public hospitals. The Other category includes service jobs such as auto repair and hair salons and organizations such as churches and social advocacy groups. Employment in the technology sector are classified under three categories: Professional and Business Services, Information, and Manufacturing. The latter category includes electronic and computer manufacturing. For further details of typical firms found in each sector, refer to the 2012 NAICS Manual (http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart=2012).\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides industry estimates for non-Bay Area metro areas. Their main industry employment estimates, the Current Employment Survey and Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, do not provide annual estimates of farm employment. To be consistent, the metro comparison evaluates nonfarm employment for all metro areas, including the Bay Area. Industry shares are thus slightly different for the Bay Area between the historical trend and metro comparison sections.\n\nThe location quotient (LQ) is used to evaluate level of concentration or clustering of an industry within the Bay Area and within each county of the region. A location quotient greater than 1 means there is a strong concentration for of jobs in an industry sector. For the Bay Area, the LQ is calculated as the share of the region\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the nation\u2019s employment in that same sector. Because BLS does not provide national farm estimates, note that there is no LQ for regional farm employment. For each county, the LQ is calculated as the share of the county\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the region\u2019s employment in that same sector.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-08-13T16:20:18.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-07-11T21:15:32.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-08-13T16:20:18.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-07-11T21:18:20.000Z", "columns_name": ["Industry", "Region", "Quadrant", "LQ", "Source", "Jobs", "Year", "PercntChng_1990"], "columns_field_name": ["industry", "region", "quadrant", "lq", "source", "jobs", "year", "percntchng_1990"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "Quadrant for visualization", "Location quotient", "", "", "", "Percent change in jobs since 1990"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {"precision": "4"}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-07-11T21:18:20.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["economy", "infrastructure", "demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/ysen-ajs2", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Jobs-by-Industry-Location-Quotient-Bay/ysen-ajs2", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}, "creator": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}
