The growth rate of 42.9% in Asian Americans between 2000 and 2010 is phenomenal given that the corresponding figure for the U.S. total population is only 9.3% (see Figure 1). Currently, Asian Americans make up 5.6% of the total U.S. population and are projected to reach 10% by 2050. It is particularly notable that Asians have recently overtaken Hispanics as the largest group of new immigrants to the U.S. (Pew Research Center, 2015).

Austin community members were invited to take the survey through social media outreach and direct email invitations. The survey and outreach materials were written in English and translated into Spanish, Vietnamese, and Simplified Chinese. A total of 1,330 community members responded to the survey.

The comments detailed in this table were in response to open-ended survey items that allowed respondents to give opinions or suggestions about each center's programming, fees, staff, and facilities. Any open-ended responses answered in Spanish, Vietnamese, or Chinese were translated prior to analysis. To gauge the general sentiment of the responses, each was categorized as \"Positive,\" \"Negative,\" \"Suggestion,\" or \"N/A.\" During analysis, some comments were deemed more relevant to other open-ended survey items than the items for which they were originally written.
