To protect confidentiality, if a town has fewer than 5 cases or positive NAAT tests over the past 7 days, those data will be suppressed.\n\nCOVID-19 cases, tests, and associated deaths from COVID-19 that have been reported among Connecticut residents. All data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. Deaths reported to the either the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) or Department of Public Health (DPH) are included in the daily COVID-19 update. \n\nThe case rate per 100,000 includes probable and confirmed cases. Probable and confirmed are defined using the CSTE case definition, which is available online: https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/2020ps/Interim-20-ID-01_COVID-19.pdf\n\nThe population data used to calculate rates is based on the CT DPH population statistics for 2019, which is available online here: https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Health-Information-Systems--Reporting/Population/Population-Statistics. Prior to 5/10/2021, the population estimates from 2018 were used.\n\nData on Connecticut deaths were obtained from the Connecticut Deaths Registry maintained by the DPH Office of Vital Records. Cause of death was determined by a death certifier (e.g., physician, APRN, medical examiner) using their best clinical judgment. Additionally, all COVID-19 deaths, including suspected or related, are required to be reported to OCME. On April 4, 2020, CT DPH and OCME released a joint memo to providers and facilities within Connecticut providing guidelines for certifying deaths due to COVID-19 that were consistent with the CDC\u2019s guidelines and a reminder of the required reporting to OCME.25,26  As of July 1, 2021, OCME had reviewed every case reported and performed additional investigation on about one-third of reported deaths to better ascertain if COVID-19 did or did not cause or contribute to the death. Some of these investigations resulted in the OCME performing postmortem swabs for PCR testing on individuals whose deaths were suspected to be due to COVID-19, but antemortem diagnosis was unable to be made.31  The OCME issued or re-issued about 10% of COVID-19 death certificates and, when appropriate, removed COVID-19 from the death certificate. For standardization and tabulation of mortality statistics, written cause of death statements made by the certifiers on death certificates are sent to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the CDC which assigns cause of death codes according to the International Causes of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) classification system.25,26  CO", "attribution": "Department of Public Health", "attribution_link": "https://portal.ct.gov/DPH", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-08-02T15:39:17.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-04-02T03:13:22.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-08-02T15:39:17.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-24T19:02:33.000Z", "columns_name": ["Number of indeterminates", "Number of negatives", "Number of positives", "Confirmed deaths", "Town number", "Last update date", "Number of tests", "Confirmed cases", "Town", "Total deaths", "Rate tested per 100k", "Case rate", "Total cases ", "People tested", "Probable deaths", "Probable cases"], "columns_field_name": ["numberofindeterminates", "numberofnegatives", "numberofpositives", "townconfirmeddeaths", "town_no", "lastupdatedate", "numberoftests", "townconfirmedcases", "town", "towntotaldeaths", "ratetested100k", "towncaserate", "towntotalcases", "peopletested", "townprobabledeaths", "townprobablecases"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Number of indeterminate tests", "Number of negative tests", "Number of positive tests", "Number of confirmed COVID-19-associated deaths", "Town number", "Date dataset was last updated", "Number of molecular COVID-19 tests reported", "Number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases", "Town name", "Sum of confirmed and probable COVID-19-associated deaths", "Rate of people tested per 100,000", "Rate of cases per 100,000", "Sum of confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases", "Number of people tested", "Number of probable COVID-19-associated deaths", "Number of probable COVID-19 cases"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"view": "date"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-06-01T19:43:54.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["social services", "public safety", "demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Health and Human Services", "domain_tags": ["covid archive"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Agency_Agency", "value": "Department of Public Health"}, {"key": "Details_Geographic-Unit", "value": "Municipality"}, {"key": "Details_Update-Frequency", "value": "Not updated (historical data)"}, {"key": "Details_Temporal-Coverage", "value": "The COVID-19 Pandemic"}, {"key": "COVID-19_Topic", "value": "Tests, cases, hospitalizations, and deaths"}, {"key": "COVID-19_Geography", "value": "Town"}, {"key": "COVID-19_Temporal-coverage", "value": "Cumulative"}, {"key": "COVID-19_Community-vs.-congregate-setting", "value": "Community and congregate settings"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.ct.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.ct.gov/d/28fr-iqnx", "link": "https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-Tests-Cases-and-Deaths-By-Town-ARCHIVE/28fr-iqnx", "owner": {"id": "dby8-627v", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Gary Archambault"}, "creator": {"id": "dby8-627v", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Gary Archambault"}}

All data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. Hospitalization data were collected by the Connecticut Hospital Association and reflect the number of patients currently hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Deaths reported to the either the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) or Department of Public Health (DPH) are included in the daily COVID-19 update. \n\nData on Connecticut deaths were obtained from the Connecticut Deaths Registry maintained by the DPH Office of Vital Records. Cause of death was determined by a death certifier (e.g., physician, APRN, medical examiner) using their best clinical judgment. Additionally, all COVID-19 deaths, including suspected or related, are required to be reported to OCME. On April 4, 2020, CT DPH and OCME released a joint memo to providers and facilities within Connecticut providing guidelines for certifying deaths due to COVID-19 that were consistent with the CDC\u2019s guidelines and a reminder of the required reporting to OCME.25,26  As of July 1, 2021, OCME had reviewed every case reported and performed additional investigation on about one-third of reported deaths to better ascertain if COVID-19 did or did not cause or contribute to the death. Some of these investigations resulted in the OCME performing postmortem swabs for PCR testing on individuals whose deaths were suspected to be due to COVID-19, but antemortem diagnosis was unable to be made.31  The OCME issued or re-issued about 10% of COVID-19 death certificates and, when appropriate, removed COVID-19 from the death certificate. For standardization and tabulation of mortality statistics, written cause of death statements made by the certifiers on death certificates are sent to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the CDC which assigns cause of death codes according to the International Causes of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) classification system.25,26  COVID-19 deaths in this report are defined as those for which the death certificate has an ICD-10 code of U07.1 as either a primary (underlying) or a contributing cause of death.

Dates are based on date of specimen collection (cases and positivity).\n\nA person is considered a new case only upon their first COVID-19 testing result because a case is defined as an instance or bout of illness. If they are tested again subsequently and are still positive, it still counts toward the test positivity metric but they are not considered another case.\n\nPercent positivity is calculated as the number of positive tests among community residents conducted during the 14 days divided by the total number of positive and negative tests among community residents during the same period.  If someone was tested more than once during that 14 day period, then those multiple test results (regardless of whether they were positive or negative) are included in the calculation.\n\nThese case and test counts do not include cases or tests among people residing in congregate settings, such as nursing homes, assisted living facilities, or correctional facilities.\n\nThese data are updated weekly and reflect the previous two full Sunday-Saturday (MMWR) weeks (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/MMWR_week_overview.pdf).\n\nDPH note about change from 7-day to 14-day metrics:\nPrior to 10/15/2020, these metrics were calculated using a 7-day average rather than a 14-day average.

CT DPH has decided to shift to 14-day rates because these are more stable, particularly at the town level, as compared to 7-day rates. In addition, since the school indicators were initially published by DPH last summer, CDC has recommended 14-day rates and other states (e.g., Massachusetts) have started to implement 14-day metrics for monitoring COVID transmission as well.\n\nWith respect to geography, we also have learned that many people are looking at the town-level data to inform decision making, despite emphasis on the county-level metrics in the published addenda.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Vaccinations by Town and Age Group - ARCHIVED", "id": "gngw-ukpw", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "NOTE:  As of 2/16/2023, this table is not being updated.  For data on COVID-19 updated (bivalent) booster coverage by town please to go to https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-Updated-Bivalent-Booster-Coverage-By-Town/bqd5-4jgh. \n\nThis table shows the number and percent of residents of each CT town that have initiated COVID-19 vaccination, are fully vaccinated and who have received additional dose 1 by age group.  \n \nAll data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. \n\nIn the data shown here, a person who has received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have initiated vaccination. A person is considered fully vaccinated if he/she has completed a primary vaccination series by receiving 2 doses of the Pfizer, Novavax or Moderna vaccines or 1 dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The fully vaccinated are a subset of the people who have received at least one dose.\n \nA person who completed a Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax or Johnson & Johnson primary series (as defined above) and then had an additional monovalent dose of COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have had additional dose 1. The additional dose may be Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax or Johnson & Johnson and may be a different type from the primary series.  For people who had a primary Pfizer or Moderna series, additional dose 1 was counted starting August 18th, 2021. For people with a Johnson & Johnson primary series additional dose 1 was counted starting October 22nd, 2021. For most people, additional dose 1 is a booster. However, additional dose 1 may represent a supplement to the primary series for a people who is moderately or severely immunosuppressed. Bivalent booster administrations are not included in the additional dose 1 calculations. \n\nThe percent with at least one dose many be over-estimated, and the percent fully vaccinated and with additional dose 1 may be under-estimated because of vaccine administration records for individuals that cannot be linked because of differences in how names or date of birth are reported. \n\nTown of residence is verified by geocoding the reported address and then mapping it a town using municipal boundaries.  If an address cannot be geocoded, the reported town is used.  Out-of-state residents vaccinated by CT providers are excluded from the table.     \n\nThe population denominators for these town- and age-specific coverage estimates are based on 2014 census estimates. This is the most recent year for which reliable town- and age-specific estimates are available. (https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Health-Information-Systems--Reporting/Population/Town-Population-with-Demographics). This census data is grouped in 5-year age bands. For vaccine coverage age groupings not consistent with a standard 5-year age band, each age was assumed to be 20% of the total within a 5-year age band. However, given the large deviation from this assumption for Mansfield because of the presence of the University of Connecticut, the age distribution observed in the 2010 census for the age bands 15 to 19 and 20 to 24 was used to estimate the population denominators. \n\nTown-level coverage estimates have been capped at 100%.  Observed coverage may be greater than 100% for multiple reasons, including census denominator data not including all individuals that currently reside in the town (e.g., part time residents, change in population size since the census), errors in address data or other reporting errors.  \n\nCaution should be used when interpreting coverage estimates for towns with large college/university populations since coverage may be underestimated. In the census, college/university students who live on or just off campus would be counted in the college/university town. However, if a student was vaccinated while studying remotely in his/her hometown, the student may be counted as a vaccine recipient in that town. \n\nConnecticut COVID-19 Vaccine Program p", "attribution": "Department of Public Health", "attribution_link": "https://portal.ct.gov/DPH", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-08-02T16:19:45.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-04-23T13:40:45.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-08-02T16:19:45.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-09T19:38:59.000Z", "columns_name": ["Additional Dose 1 Received Percent", "Additional Dose 1 Received Count", "Date Updated", "Fully Vaccinated Percent", "Fully Vaccinated Count", "Initiated Vaccination Percent", "Initiated Vaccination Count", "Population", "At least one census tract SVI\u22650.75", "Age Group", "Town"], "columns_field_name": ["additional_dose_1_received_percent", "additional_dose_1_received", "dateupdated", "fully_vaccinated_percent", "fully_vaccinated", "initiated_vaccination_percent", "initiated_vaccination", "population", "at_least_one_census_tract", "age_group", "town"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Additional Dose 1 Received Percent", "Additional Dose 1 Received Count", "Date updated", "Fully vaccinated percent", "Fully vaccinated count", "Initiated vaccination percent", "Initiated vaccination count", "Estimated population", "Yes/no: Indicates whether or not each town has at least one census tract with a Social Vulnerability index 75% or greater", "Age group", "Town name"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {"view": "date"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-04-27T13:34:40.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Health and Human Services", "domain_tags": ["covid-19", "covid archive", "covid vaccination"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Agency_Agency", "value": "Department of Public Health"}, {"key": "Details_Geographic-Unit", "value": "Municipality"}, {"key": "Details_Update-Frequency", "value": "Not updated (historical data)"}, {"key": "Details_Temporal-Coverage", "value": "The COVID-19 Pandemic"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.ct.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.ct.gov/d/gngw-ukpw", "link": "https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-Vaccinations-by-Town-and-Age-Group-ARCHIV/gngw-ukpw", "owner": {"id": "dby8-627v", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Gary Archambault"}, "creator": {"id": "dby8-627v", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Gary Archambault"}}

Additionally, reporting entities may submit correction files to contribute historic data during initial onboarding or to address data quality issues; while this is rare, these correction files may cause a large amount of data from outside of the current reporting window to be uploaded in a single day; this would result in the change in cumulative_cases being much larger than the value of cases_7days.\n\nOn June 4, 2020, the US Department of Health and Human Services issued guidance requiring the reporting of positive and negative test results for SARS-CoV-2; this guidance expired with the end of the federal PHE on 5/11/2023, and negative SARS-CoV-2 results were removed from the List of Reportable Laboratory Findings.

As of 6/27/2022, the data will be published in four tables instead of twelve.\n\nThe COVID-19 Cases, Deaths, and Tests by Day dataset contains cases and test data by date of sample submission.  The death data are by date of death.  This dataset is updated daily and contains information back to the beginning of the pandemic.  The data can be found at https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-Cases-Deaths-and-Tests-by-Day/g9vi-2ahj.\n\nThe COVID-19 State Metrics dataset contains over 93 columns of data.

The data can be found at https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-State-Level-Data/qmgw-5kp6 .\n\nThe COVID-19 County Metrics dataset contains 25 columns of data.

The data can be found at https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-Town-Level-Data/icxw-cada .   To protect confidentiality, if a town has fewer than 5 cases or positive NAAT tests over the past 7 days, those data will be suppressed.\n\nCOVID-19 cases and associated deaths that have been reported among Connecticut residents, broken out by age group. All data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. Deaths reported to the either the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) or Department of Public Health (DPH) are included in the daily COVID-19 update. \n\nData are reported daily, with timestamps indicated in the daily briefings posted at: portal.ct.gov/coronavirus.

The normal data cycle resumed with the data for 06/23/2020.\n\nA network outage on 05/19/2020 resulted in a change in the data pull schedule.
