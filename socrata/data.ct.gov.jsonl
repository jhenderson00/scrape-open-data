To protect confidentiality, if a town has fewer than 5 cases or positive NAAT tests over the past 7 days, those data will be suppressed.\n\nCOVID-19 cases, tests, and associated deaths from COVID-19 that have been reported among Connecticut residents. All data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. Deaths reported to the either the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) or Department of Public Health (DPH) are included in the daily COVID-19 update. \n\nThe case rate per 100,000 includes probable and confirmed cases. Probable and confirmed are defined using the CSTE case definition, which is available online: https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/2020ps/Interim-20-ID-01_COVID-19.pdf\n\nThe population data used to calculate rates is based on the CT DPH population statistics for 2019, which is available online here: https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Health-Information-Systems--Reporting/Population/Population-Statistics. Prior to 5/10/2021, the population estimates from 2018 were used.\n\nData on Connecticut deaths were obtained from the Connecticut Deaths Registry maintained by the DPH Office of Vital Records. Cause of death was determined by a death certifier (e.g., physician, APRN, medical examiner) using their best clinical judgment. Additionally, all COVID-19 deaths, including suspected or related, are required to be reported to OCME. On April 4, 2020, CT DPH and OCME released a joint memo to providers and facilities within Connecticut providing guidelines for certifying deaths due to COVID-19 that were consistent with the CDC\u2019s guidelines and a reminder of the required reporting to OCME.25,26  As of July 1, 2021, OCME had reviewed every case reported and performed additional investigation on about one-third of reported deaths to better ascertain if COVID-19 did or did not cause or contribute to the death. Some of these investigations resulted in the OCME performing postmortem swabs for PCR testing on individuals whose deaths were suspected to be due to COVID-19, but antemortem diagnosis was unable to be made.31  The OCME issued or re-issued about 10% of COVID-19 death certificates and, when appropriate, removed COVID-19 from the death certificate. For standardization and tabulation of mortality statistics, written cause of death statements made by the certifiers on death certificates are sent to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the CDC which assigns cause of death codes according to the International Causes of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) classification system.25,26  CO", "attribution": "Department of Public Health", "attribution_link": "https://portal.ct.gov/DPH", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-08-02T15:39:17.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-04-02T03:13:22.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-08-02T15:39:17.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-24T19:02:33.000Z", "columns_name": ["Number of indeterminates", "Number of negatives", "Number of positives", "Confirmed deaths", "Town number", "Last update date", "Number of tests", "Confirmed cases", "Town", "Total deaths", "Rate tested per 100k", "Case rate", "Total cases ", "People tested", "Probable deaths", "Probable cases"], "columns_field_name": ["numberofindeterminates", "numberofnegatives", "numberofpositives", "townconfirmeddeaths", "town_no", "lastupdatedate", "numberoftests", "townconfirmedcases", "town", "towntotaldeaths", "ratetested100k", "towncaserate", "towntotalcases", "peopletested", "townprobabledeaths", "townprobablecases"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Number of indeterminate tests", "Number of negative tests", "Number of positive tests", "Number of confirmed COVID-19-associated deaths", "Town number", "Date dataset was last updated", "Number of molecular COVID-19 tests reported", "Number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases", "Town name", "Sum of confirmed and probable COVID-19-associated deaths", "Rate of people tested per 100,000", "Rate of cases per 100,000", "Sum of confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases", "Number of people tested", "Number of probable COVID-19-associated deaths", "Number of probable COVID-19 cases"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"view": "date"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-06-01T19:43:54.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["social services", "public safety", "demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Health and Human Services", "domain_tags": ["covid archive"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Agency_Agency", "value": "Department of Public Health"}, {"key": "Details_Geographic-Unit", "value": "Municipality"}, {"key": "Details_Update-Frequency", "value": "Not updated (historical data)"}, {"key": "Details_Temporal-Coverage", "value": "The COVID-19 Pandemic"}, {"key": "COVID-19_Topic", "value": "Tests, cases, hospitalizations, and deaths"}, {"key": "COVID-19_Geography", "value": "Town"}, {"key": "COVID-19_Temporal-coverage", "value": "Cumulative"}, {"key": "COVID-19_Community-vs.-congregate-setting", "value": "Community and congregate settings"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.ct.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.ct.gov/d/28fr-iqnx", "link": "https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-Tests-Cases-and-Deaths-By-Town-ARCHIVE/28fr-iqnx", "owner": {"id": "dby8-627v", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Gary Archambault"}, "creator": {"id": "dby8-627v", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Gary Archambault"}}

All data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. Hospitalization data were collected by the Connecticut Hospital Association and reflect the number of patients currently hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Deaths reported to the either the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) or Department of Public Health (DPH) are included in the daily COVID-19 update. \n\nData on Connecticut deaths were obtained from the Connecticut Deaths Registry maintained by the DPH Office of Vital Records. Cause of death was determined by a death certifier (e.g., physician, APRN, medical examiner) using their best clinical judgment. Additionally, all COVID-19 deaths, including suspected or related, are required to be reported to OCME. On April 4, 2020, CT DPH and OCME released a joint memo to providers and facilities within Connecticut providing guidelines for certifying deaths due to COVID-19 that were consistent with the CDC\u2019s guidelines and a reminder of the required reporting to OCME.25,26  As of July 1, 2021, OCME had reviewed every case reported and performed additional investigation on about one-third of reported deaths to better ascertain if COVID-19 did or did not cause or contribute to the death. Some of these investigations resulted in the OCME performing postmortem swabs for PCR testing on individuals whose deaths were suspected to be due to COVID-19, but antemortem diagnosis was unable to be made.31  The OCME issued or re-issued about 10% of COVID-19 death certificates and, when appropriate, removed COVID-19 from the death certificate. For standardization and tabulation of mortality statistics, written cause of death statements made by the certifiers on death certificates are sent to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the CDC which assigns cause of death codes according to the International Causes of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) classification system.25,26  COVID-19 deaths in this report are defined as those for which the death certificate has an ICD-10 code of U07.1 as either a primary (underlying) or a contributing cause of death.

Dates are based on date of specimen collection (cases and positivity).\n\nA person is considered a new case only upon their first COVID-19 testing result because a case is defined as an instance or bout of illness. If they are tested again subsequently and are still positive, it still counts toward the test positivity metric but they are not considered another case.\n\nPercent positivity is calculated as the number of positive tests among community residents conducted during the 14 days divided by the total number of positive and negative tests among community residents during the same period.  If someone was tested more than once during that 14 day period, then those multiple test results (regardless of whether they were positive or negative) are included in the calculation.\n\nThese case and test counts do not include cases or tests among people residing in congregate settings, such as nursing homes, assisted living facilities, or correctional facilities.\n\nThese data are updated weekly and reflect the previous two full Sunday-Saturday (MMWR) weeks (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/MMWR_week_overview.pdf).\n\nDPH note about change from 7-day to 14-day metrics:\nPrior to 10/15/2020, these metrics were calculated using a 7-day average rather than a 14-day average.

CT DPH has decided to shift to 14-day rates because these are more stable, particularly at the town level, as compared to 7-day rates. In addition, since the school indicators were initially published by DPH last summer, CDC has recommended 14-day rates and other states (e.g., Massachusetts) have started to implement 14-day metrics for monitoring COVID transmission as well.\n\nWith respect to geography, we also have learned that many people are looking at the town-level data to inform decision making, despite emphasis on the county-level metrics in the published addenda.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Vaccinations by Town and Age Group - ARCHIVED", "id": "gngw-ukpw", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "NOTE:  As of 2/16/2023, this table is not being updated.  For data on COVID-19 updated (bivalent) booster coverage by town please to go to https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-Updated-Bivalent-Booster-Coverage-By-Town/bqd5-4jgh. \n\nThis table shows the number and percent of residents of each CT town that have initiated COVID-19 vaccination, are fully vaccinated and who have received additional dose 1 by age group.  \n \nAll data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. \n\nIn the data shown here, a person who has received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have initiated vaccination. A person is considered fully vaccinated if he/she has completed a primary vaccination series by receiving 2 doses of the Pfizer, Novavax or Moderna vaccines or 1 dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The fully vaccinated are a subset of the people who have received at least one dose.\n \nA person who completed a Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax or Johnson & Johnson primary series (as defined above) and then had an additional monovalent dose of COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have had additional dose 1. The additional dose may be Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax or Johnson & Johnson and may be a different type from the primary series.  For people who had a primary Pfizer or Moderna series, additional dose 1 was counted starting August 18th, 2021. For people with a Johnson & Johnson primary series additional dose 1 was counted starting October 22nd, 2021. For most people, additional dose 1 is a booster. However, additional dose 1 may represent a supplement to the primary series for a people who is moderately or severely immunosuppressed. Bivalent booster administrations are not included in the additional dose 1 calculations. \n\nThe percent with at least one dose many be over-estimated, and the percent fully vaccinated and with additional dose 1 may be under-estimated because of vaccine administration records for individuals that cannot be linked because of differences in how names or date of birth are reported. \n\nTown of residence is verified by geocoding the reported address and then mapping it a town using municipal boundaries.  If an address cannot be geocoded, the reported town is used.  Out-of-state residents vaccinated by CT providers are excluded from the table.     \n\nThe population denominators for these town- and age-specific coverage estimates are based on 2014 census estimates. This is the most recent year for which reliable town- and age-specific estimates are available. (https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Health-Information-Systems--Reporting/Population/Town-Population-with-Demographics). This census data is grouped in 5-year age bands. For vaccine coverage age groupings not consistent with a standard 5-year age band, each age was assumed to be 20% of the total within a 5-year age band. However, given the large deviation from this assumption for Mansfield because of the presence of the University of Connecticut, the age distribution observed in the 2010 census for the age bands 15 to 19 and 20 to 24 was used to estimate the population denominators. \n\nTown-level coverage estimates have been capped at 100%.  Observed coverage may be greater than 100% for multiple reasons, including census denominator data not including all individuals that currently reside in the town (e.g., part time residents, change in population size since the census), errors in address data or other reporting errors.  \n\nCaution should be used when interpreting coverage estimates for towns with large college/university populations since coverage may be underestimated. In the census, college/university students who live on or just off campus would be counted in the college/university town. However, if a student was vaccinated while studying remotely in his/her hometown, the student may be counted as a vaccine recipient in that town. \n\nConnecticut COVID-19 Vaccine Program p", "attribution": "Department of Public Health", "attribution_link": "https://portal.ct.gov/DPH", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-08-02T16:19:45.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-04-23T13:40:45.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-08-02T16:19:45.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-09T19:38:59.000Z", "columns_name": ["Additional Dose 1 Received Percent", "Additional Dose 1 Received Count", "Date Updated", "Fully Vaccinated Percent", "Fully Vaccinated Count", "Initiated Vaccination Percent", "Initiated Vaccination Count", "Population", "At least one census tract SVI\u22650.75", "Age Group", "Town"], "columns_field_name": ["additional_dose_1_received_percent", "additional_dose_1_received", "dateupdated", "fully_vaccinated_percent", "fully_vaccinated", "initiated_vaccination_percent", "initiated_vaccination", "population", "at_least_one_census_tract", "age_group", "town"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Additional Dose 1 Received Percent", "Additional Dose 1 Received Count", "Date updated", "Fully vaccinated percent", "Fully vaccinated count", "Initiated vaccination percent", "Initiated vaccination count", "Estimated population", "Yes/no: Indicates whether or not each town has at least one census tract with a Social Vulnerability index 75% or greater", "Age group", "Town name"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {"view": "date"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-04-27T13:34:40.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Health and Human Services", "domain_tags": ["covid-19", "covid archive", "covid vaccination"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Agency_Agency", "value": "Department of Public Health"}, {"key": "Details_Geographic-Unit", "value": "Municipality"}, {"key": "Details_Update-Frequency", "value": "Not updated (historical data)"}, {"key": "Details_Temporal-Coverage", "value": "The COVID-19 Pandemic"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.ct.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.ct.gov/d/gngw-ukpw", "link": "https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-Vaccinations-by-Town-and-Age-Group-ARCHIV/gngw-ukpw", "owner": {"id": "dby8-627v", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Gary Archambault"}, "creator": {"id": "dby8-627v", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Gary Archambault"}}

Additionally, reporting entities may submit correction files to contribute historic data during initial onboarding or to address data quality issues; while this is rare, these correction files may cause a large amount of data from outside of the current reporting window to be uploaded in a single day; this would result in the change in cumulative_cases being much larger than the value of cases_7days.\n\nOn June 4, 2020, the US Department of Health and Human Services issued guidance requiring the reporting of positive and negative test results for SARS-CoV-2; this guidance expired with the end of the federal PHE on 5/11/2023, and negative SARS-CoV-2 results were removed from the List of Reportable Laboratory Findings.

Enrollment data on this limited-benefit Medicaid coverage group is being incorporated into Medicaid data effective January 1, 2021. \n\nEnrollment data for this coverage group prior to January 1, 2021, was listed under State Funded Medical. An historical accounting of enrollment of the specific coverage group starting in calendar year 2020 will also be published separately.\n\n<b>2018</b>\nOn April 22, 2019 the methodology for determining HUSKY A Newborn recipients changed, which caused an increase of recipients for that benefit starting in October 2016. We now count recipients recorded in the ImpaCT system as well as in the HIX system for that assistance type, instead using HIX exclusively.\n\nAlso, the methodology for determining the address of the recipients changed:\n1. The address of a recipient in the ImpaCT system is now correctly determined specific to that month instead of using the address of the most recent month. This resulted in some shuffling of the recipients among townships starting in October 2016.\n\n2. If, in a given month, a recipient has benefit records in both the HIX system and in the ImpaCT system, the address of the recipient is now calculated as follows to resolve conflicts: Use the residential address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the mailing address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the address in HIX. This resulted in a reduction in counts for most townships starting in March 2017 because a single address is now used instead of two when the systems do not agree.\n\nOn February 14, 2019 the enrollment counts for 2012-2015 across all programs were updated to account for an error in the data integration process. As a result, the count of the number of people served increased by 13% for 2012, 10% for 2013, 8% for 2014 and 4% for 2015. Counts for 2016, 2017 and 2018 remain unchanged.\n\nOn January 16, 2019 these counts were revised to count a recipient in all locations that recipient resided in that year.\n\nOn January 1, 2019 the counts were revised to count a recipient in only one town per year even when the recipient moved within the year.

The three major rating agencies are Moody\u2019s Investor Services, Standard and Poor\u2019s Corporation, and Fitch Incorporated.\n\nData on the Municipal Fiscal Indicators is included in the following datasets:\n\nMunicipal Fiscal Indicators, 2019\nhttps://data.ct.gov/Local-Government/Municipal-Fiscal-Indicators-2019/sb4i-6vik\n\nMunicipal Fiscal Indicators: Pension Funding Information For Defined Benefit Pension Plans, 2019\nhttps://data.ct.gov/Local-Government/Municipal-Fiscal-Indicators-Pension-Funding-Inform/civu-w22d\n\nMunicipal Fiscal Indicators: Type and Number of Pension Plans, 2019\nhttps://data.ct.gov/Local-Government/Municipal-Fiscal-Indicators-Type-and-Number-of-Pen/9f65-c4yr\n\nMunicipal Fiscal Indicators: Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB), 2019\nhttps://data.ct.gov/Local-Government/Municipal-Fiscal-Indicators-Other-Post-Employment-/sa26-46h8\n\nMunicipal Fiscal Indicators: Economic and Grand List Data, 2019\nhttps://data.ct.gov/Local-Government/Municipal-Fiscal-Indicators-Economic-and-Grand-Lis/wpbp-b657\n\nMunicipal Fiscal Indicators: Bond Ratings, 2019\nhttps://data.ct.gov/Local-Government/Municipal-Fiscal-Indicators-Bond-Ratings-2019/3w9d-7jbi\n\nMunicipal Fiscal Indicators: Benchmark Labor Data, 2019\nhttps://data.ct.gov/Local-Government/Municipal-Fiscal-Indicators-Benchmark-Labor-Data-2/db37-h23r\n\nMunicipal Fiscal Indicators: Unemployment, 2019\nhttps://data.ct.gov/Local-Government/Municipal-Fiscal-Indicators-Unemployment-2019/cugp-2za3", "attribution": "Office of Policy and Management", "attribution_link": "https://portal.ct.gov/OPM/IGP-MUNFINSR/Municipal-Financial-Services/Municipal-Fiscal-Indicators", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-08-09T13:31:04.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-06-25T13:39:20.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-08-09T13:31:04.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2021-06-25T13:57:55.000Z", "columns_name": ["Bond Rating", "Rating Agency", "Town", "Benchmark Year", "Rating Date"], "columns_field_name": ["bond_rating", "rating_agency", "town", "benchmark_year", "rating_date"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date"], "columns_description": ["Bond Rating", "Rating Agency (Moody\u2019s Investor Services, Standard and Poor\u2019s Corporation, or Fitch Incorporated)", "Town", "Benchmark Year", "Rating Date"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {"view": "date_shortmonthy"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2021-06-25T13:51:09.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["health", "environment", "education"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Local Government", "domain_tags": ["2019 municipal fiscal indicators", "municipal fiscal indicators"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Agency_Agency", "value": "Office of Policy and Management"}, {"key": "Details_Geographic-Unit", "value": "Municipality"}, {"key": "Details_Update-Frequency", "value": "Not updated (historical data)"}, {"key": "Details_Temporal-Coverage", "value": "2015 - 2019 "}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.ct.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.ct.gov/d/3w9d-7jbi", "link": "https://data.ct.gov/Local-Government/Municipal-Fiscal-Indicators-Bond-Ratings-2019/3w9d-7jbi", "owner": {"id": "rfiw-8538", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Pauline Zaldonis"}, "creator": {"id": "rfiw-8538", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Pauline Zaldonis"}}

{"resource": {"name": "DSS Assistance Type Participation CY 2012-2022", "id": "44qf-qawh", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "In order to facilitate public review and access, enrollment data published on the Open Data Portal is provided as promptly as possible after the end of each month or year, as applicable to the data set. Due to eligibility policies and operational processes, enrollment can vary slightly after publication. Please be aware of the point-in-time nature of the published data when comparing to other data published or shared by the Department of Social Services, as this data may vary slightly.\n\nAs a general practice, for monthly data sets published on the Open Data Portal, DSS will continue to refresh the monthly enrollment data for three months, after which time it will remain static. For example, when March data is published the data in January and February will be refreshed. When April data is published, February and March data will be refreshed, but January will not change. This allows the Department to account for the most common enrollment variations in published data while also ensuring that data remains as stable as possible over time. In the event of a significant change in enrollment data, the Department may republish reports and will notate such republication dates and reasons accordingly.\nIn March 2020, Connecticut opted to add a new Medicaid coverage group: the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured. Enrollment data on this limited-benefit Medicaid coverage group is being incorporated into Medicaid data effective January 1, 2021. Enrollment data for this coverage group prior to January 1, 2021, was listed under State Funded Medical. An historical accounting of enrollment of the specific coverage group starting in calendar year 2020 will also be published separately.\nThe data represents number of active recipients who received benefits of a certain assistance type in that calendar year. A recipient may have received benefits of multiple types in the same year; if so that recipient will be included in multiple categories in this dataset (counted more than once.)\nFor privacy considerations, a count of zero is used for counts less than five.\nNOTE: On April 22, 2019 the methodology for determining HUSKY A Newborn recipients changed, which caused an increase of recipients for that benefit starting in October 2016. We now count recipients recorded in the ImpaCT system as well as in the HIX system for that assistance type, instead using HIX exclusively.\nAlso, the methodology for determining the address of the recipients changed:\n    1. The address of a recipient in the ImpaCT system is now correctly determined specific to that month instead of using the address of the most recent month. This resulted in some shuffling of the recipients among townships starting in October 2016.\n    2. If, in a given month, a recipient has benefit records in both the HIX system and in the ImpaCT system, the address of the recipient is now calculated as follows to resolve conflicts: Use the residential address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the mailing address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the address in HIX. This resulted in a reduction in counts for most townships starting in March 2017 because a single address is now used instead of two when the systems do not agree.\nNOTE: On February 14 2019, the enrollment counts for 2012-2015 across all programs were updated to account for an error in the data integration process. As a result, the count of the number of people served increased by 13% for 2012, 10% for 2013, 8% for 2014 and 4% for 2015. Counts for 2016, 2017 and 2018 remain unchanged.\nNOTE: On 11/30/2018 the counts were revised because of a change in the way active recipients were counted in one source system.", "attribution": "Department of Social Services", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-09-18T19:44:00.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-09-12T19:05:16.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-09-18T19:44:00.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-04-11T17:42:47.000Z", "columns_name": ["active_recipients", "assistance_type", "year"], "columns_field_name": ["active_recipients", "assistance_type", "year"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-09-12T19:06:40.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["finance", "public safety"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Health and Human Services", "domain_tags": ["assistance type", "department of social services", "dss", "dss enrollment counts", "enrollment counts"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Agency_Agency", "value": "Department of Social Services"}, {"key": "Details_Geographic-Unit", "value": "State"}, {"key": "Details_Update-Frequency", "value": "Annually"}, {"key": "Details_Temporal-Coverage", "value": "2012-2022"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.ct.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.ct.gov/d/44qf-qawh", "link": "https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/DSS-Assistance-Type-Participation-CY-2012-2022/44qf-qawh", "owner": {"id": "fdda-4dst", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Vijay Subramaniam"}, "creator": {"id": "fdda-4dst", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Vijay Subramaniam"}}

{"resource": {"name": "DSS Assistance Type Participation by Month CY 2012-2023", "id": "4bgy-4ez6", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "In order to facilitate public review and access, enrollment data published on the Open Data Portal is provided as promptly as possible after the end of each month or year, as applicable to the data set.  Due to eligibility policies and operational processes, enrollment can vary slightly after publication.  Please be aware of the point-in-time nature of the published data when comparing to other data published or shared by the Department of Social Services, as this data may vary slightly.  \n\nAs a general practice, for monthly data sets published on the Open Data Portal, DSS will continue to refresh the monthly enrollment data for three months, after which time it will remain static.  For example, when March data is published the data in January and February will be refreshed.  When April data is published, February and March data will be refreshed, but January will not change.  This allows the Department to account for the most common enrollment variations in published data while also ensuring that data remains as stable as possible over time.   In the event of a significant change in enrollment data, the Department may republish reports and will notate such republication dates and reasons accordingly.\nIn March 2020, Connecticut opted to add a new Medicaid coverage group: the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured. Enrollment data on this limited-benefit Medicaid coverage group is being incorporated into Medicaid data effective January 1, 2021.  Enrollment data for this coverage group prior to January 1, 2021, was listed under State Funded Medical. Effective January 1, 2021, this coverage group have been separated: (1) the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured is now G06-I and is now listed as a limited benefit plan that rolls up into \u201cProgram Name\u201d of Medicaid and \u201cMedical Benefit Plan\u201d of HUSKY Limited Benefit; (2) the emergency medical coverage has been separated into G06-II as a limited benefit plan that rolls up into \u201cProgram Name\u201d of Emergency Medical and \u201cMedical Benefit Plan\u201d of Other Medical. An historical accounting of enrollment of the specific coverage group starting in calendar year 2020 will also be published separately.\nThis data represents number of active recipients who received benefits of a certain assistance type in that calendar year and month. A recipient may have received benefits of multiple types in the same month; if so that recipient will be included in multiple categories in this dataset (counted more than once.)\n2021 is a partial year.\nFor privacy considerations, a count of zero is used for counts less than five.\nNOTE: On April 22, 2019 the methodology for determining HUSKY A Newborn recipients changed, which caused an increase of recipients for that benefit starting in October 2016. We now count recipients recorded in the ImpaCT system as well as in the HIX system for that assistance type, instead using HIX exclusively.\nAlso, corrections in the ImpaCT system for January and February 2019 caused the addition of around 2000 and 3000 recipients respectively, and the counts for many types of assistance (e.g. SNAP) were adjusted upward for those 2 months.\nAlso, the methodology for determining the address of the recipients changed:\n    1. The address of a recipient in the ImpaCT system is now correctly determined specific to that month instead of using the address of the most recent month. This resulted in some shuffling of the recipients among townships starting in October 2016.\n    2. If, in a given month, a recipient has benefit records in both the HIX system and in the ImpaCT system, the address of the recipient is now calculated as follows to resolve conflicts: Use the residential address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the mailing address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the address in HIX. This resulted in a reduction in counts for most townships starting in March 2017 because a single address is now used instead of two when the systems do not agree.\nNOTE: On February 14 2019, the enro", "attribution": "Department of Social Services", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-01-11T20:56:18.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-09-12T23:06:25.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-01-11T20:56:17.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-01-11T20:56:18.000Z", "columns_name": ["active_recipients", "year_month", "assistance_type"], "columns_field_name": ["active_recipients", "year_month", "assistance_type"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-03-11T17:08:09.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Health and Human Services", "domain_tags": ["assistance type", "department of social services", "dss", "dss enrollment counts", "enrollment counts", "monthly"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Agency_Agency", "value": "Department of Social Services"}, {"key": "Details_Geographic-Unit", "value": "State"}, {"key": "Details_Update-Frequency", "value": "Monthly"}, {"key": "Details_Temporal-Coverage", "value": "2012-2023"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.ct.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.ct.gov/d/4bgy-4ez6", "link": "https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/DSS-Assistance-Type-Participation-by-Month-CY-2012/4bgy-4ez6", "owner": {"id": "fdda-4dst", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Vijay Subramaniam"}, "creator": {"id": "fdda-4dst", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Vijay Subramaniam"}}

{"resource": {"name": "DSS Types of Assistance (TOA) Participation CY 2012-2022", "id": "4rjp-gw6s", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "In order to facilitate public review and access, enrollment data published on the Open Data Portal is provided as promptly as possible after the end of each month or year, as applicable to the data set. Due to eligibility policies and operational processes, enrollment can vary slightly after publication. Please be aware of the point-in-time nature of the published data when comparing to other data published or shared by the Department of Social Services, as this data may vary slightly.\n\nAs a general practice, for monthly data sets published on the Open Data Portal, DSS will continue to refresh the monthly enrollment data for three months, after which time it will remain static. For example, when March data is published the data in January and February will be refreshed. When April data is published, February and March data will be refreshed, but January will not change. This allows the Department to account for the most common enrollment variations in published data while also ensuring that data remains as stable as possible over time. In the event of a significant change in enrollment data, the Department may republish reports and will notate such republication dates and reasons accordingly.\nIn March 2020, Connecticut opted to add a new Medicaid coverage group: the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured. Enrollment data on this limited-benefit Medicaid coverage group is being incorporated into Medicaid data effective January 1, 2021. Enrollment data for this coverage group prior to January 1, 2021, was listed under State Funded Medical. An historical accounting of enrollment of the specific coverage group starting in calendar year 2020 will also be published separately.\nThe data represents number of active recipients who received benefits from a type of assistance (TOA) in that calendar year. A recipient may have received benefits from multiple TOAs in the same year; if so that recipient will be included in multiple categories in this dataset (counted more than once.)\nFor privacy considerations, a count of zero is used for counts less than five.\nNOTE: On April 22, 2019 the methodology for determining HUSKY A Newborn recipients changed, which caused an increase of recipients for that benefit starting in October 2016. We now count recipients recorded in the ImpaCT system as well as in the HIX system for that assistance type, instead using HIX exclusively.\nAlso, the methodology for determining the address of the recipients changed:\n    1. The address of a recipient in the ImpaCT system is now correctly determined specific to that month instead of using the address of the most recent month. This resulted in some shuffling of the recipients among townships starting in October 2016.\n    2. If, in a given month, a recipient has benefit records in both the HIX system and in the ImpaCT system, the address of the recipient is now calculated as follows to resolve conflicts: Use the residential address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the mailing address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the address in HIX. This resulted in a reduction in counts for most townships starting in March 2017 because a single address is now used instead of two when the systems do not agree.\nNOTE: On February 14 2019, the enrollment counts for 2012-2015 across all programs were updated to account for an error in the data integration process. As a result, the count of the number of people served increased by 13% for 2012, 10% for 2013, 8% for 2014 and 4% for 2015. Counts for 2016, 2017 and 2018 remain unchanged.\nNOTE: On 11/30/2018 the counts were revised because of a change in the way active recipients were counted in one source system.", "attribution": "Department of Social Services", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-09-18T19:49:33.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-09-13T12:12:07.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-09-18T19:49:33.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-04-11T17:57:56.000Z", "columns_name": ["count", "description", "toa", "year"], "columns_field_name": ["count", "description", "toa", "year"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-09-13T12:12:45.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["finance", "public safety"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Health and Human Services", "domain_tags": ["dss", "enrollment counts", "types of assistance"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Agency_Agency", "value": "Department of Social Services"}, {"key": "Details_Geographic-Unit", "value": "Not applicable"}, {"key": "Details_Update-Frequency", "value": "Annually"}, {"key": "Details_Temporal-Coverage", "value": "2012-2022"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.ct.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.ct.gov/d/4rjp-gw6s", "link": "https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/DSS-Types-of-Assistance-TOA-Participation-CY-2012-/4rjp-gw6s", "owner": {"id": "fdda-4dst", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Vijay Subramaniam"}, "creator": {"id": "fdda-4dst", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Vijay Subramaniam"}}

Caution should be taken when making comparisons of percentages calculated using the 2019 and 2020 census estimates since observed difference may result from the shift in the denominator. The age groups in the state-level data tables will also be changing as a result of the switch to the new denominator.\n\n* DPH Provisional State and County Characteristics Estimates April 1, 2020.

Connecticut Department of Public Health, Health Statistics & Surveillance, SAR, Hartford, CT.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThis table shows the number and percent of people that have initiated COVID-19 vaccination, are fully vaccinated and had additional dose 1 by race / ethnicity and age group.\n\nAll data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. The age groups in the state-level data tables will also be changing as a result of the switch to the new denominator.\n\nPopulation size estimates are based on 2019 DPH census estimates until 5/26/2022.  From 6/1/2022, 2020 DPH provisional census estimates are used. \n\nIn the data shown here, a person who has received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have initiated vaccination. A person is considered fully vaccinated if he/she has completed a primary vaccination series by receiving 2 doses of the Pfizer, Novavax or Moderna vaccines or 1 dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The fully vaccinated are a subset of the people who have received at least one dose.\n \nA person who completed a Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax or Johnson & Johnson primary series (as defined above) and then had an additional monovalent dose of COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have had  additional dose 1. The additional dose may be Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax or Johnson & Johnson and may be a different type from the primary series.  For people who had a primary Pfizer or Moderna series, additional dose 1 was counted starting August 18th, 2021. For people with a Johnson & Johnson primary series additional dose 1 was counted starting October 22nd, 2021. For most people, additional dose 1 is a booster. However, additional dose 1 may represent a supplement to the primary series for a people who is moderately or severely immunosuppressed. Bivalent booster administrations are not included in the additional dose 1 calculations.\n\nThe percent with at least one dose many be over-estimated, and the percent fully vaccinated and with additional dose 1 may be under-estimated because of vaccine administration records for individuals that cannot be linked because of differences in how names or date of birth are reported. \n\nRace and ethnicity data may be self-reported or taken from an existing electronic health care record. Reported race and ethnicity information is used to create a single race/ethnicity variable. People with Hispanic ethnicity are classified as Hispanic regardless of reported race. People with a missing ethnicity are classified as non-Hispanic. People with more than one race are classified as multiple races.\n\nA vaccine coverage percentage cannot be calculated for people classified as NH Other race or NH Unknown race since there are not population size estimates for these groups.

{"resource": {"name": "CT Municipalities", "id": "5c5g-mddb", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "The CT Municipalities layer consists of individual polygons representing each of the 169 municipalities that make up the state of Connecticut. This feature class is based on the Towns layer originally created by CTDEEP from USGS maps. The towns from the CTDEEP data were dissolved to create 169 records (one for each town). Fields were added and deleted to create a generic schema.\n\nThe CT Municipalities feature class was created in (municipality) alphabetical order. Fields were added to identify the municipality number and the CTDOT Municipality number, which differ from each other in some cases. In 1947 the town of Saybrook officially changed its name to Deep River. Other State agencies and municipalities changed their numbering systems to reflect this name change, however, most of what is now CTDOT kept their existing numbering system. This is why the CTDOT town number for Deep River is 122, the number formerly assigned to Saybrook\n\nThe square miles associated with each town are for their interior land mass area. Coastal communities have boundaries that extend into Long Island Sound. These town boundary extensions into Long Island Sound are not included in the square miles field.\n\nCTDOT has created and will maintain a cartographic rendering of the geometric shape of Municipal boundaries. Official Town and City designations as incorporated areas consisting of an authorized governing body are managed by CT's Office of Policy and Management (OPM).\n\nCTDOT has undertaken a good faith effort to represent the boundaries cartographically in a fair and equitable fashion, from the best available data compiled from existing state, regional, and local resources including - existing historical cartographic renderings of the boundary locations, supplemental survey information, and map submissions. Corrections can be submitted to the CTDOT for incorporation and correction where applicable.\n\nAttribution was assigned to designations managed by a variety of entities that strictly follow Municipal boundaries and additional designations will be added as requested by State, regional, and local partners.\n\nDisclaimer\nThe data presented here is for informational purposes only.

This dataset contains the same values used to display information available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels-county-map.html.\n\nCDC looks at the combination of three metrics \u2014 new COVID-19 admissions per 100,000 population in the past 7 days, the percent of staffed inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients, and total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days \u2014 to determine the COVID-19 community level. The COVID-19 community level is determined by the higher of the new admissions and inpatient beds metrics, based on the current level of new cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days. New COVID-19 admissions and the percent of staffed inpatient beds occupied represent the current potential for strain on the health system. Data on new cases acts as an early warning indicator of potential increases in health system strain in the event of a COVID-19 surge.\n\nUsing these data, the COVID-19 community level is classified as low, medium , or high.\n\nCOVID-19 Community Levels can help communities and individuals make decisions based on their local context and their unique needs. Community vaccination coverage and other local information, like early alerts from surveillance, such as through wastewater or the number of emergency department visits for COVID-19, when available, can also inform decision making for health officials and individuals.

To view the full dataset and filter the data, click the \"View Data\" button at the top right of the screen. More data on people served by DSS can be found <a href=\"https://data.ct.gov/browse?tags=dss%20enrollment%20counts\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n\n<b>About this data</b>\n  <li>For privacy considerations, a count of zero is used for counts less than five.</li>\n  <li>A recipient is counted in all towns where that recipient resided in that year.</li>\n  <li>Due to eligibility policies and operational processes, enrollment can vary slightly after publication. Please be aware of the point-in-time nature of the published data when comparing to other data published or shared by the Department of Social Services, as this data may vary slightly.</li>\n\n<b>Notes by year</b>\n<b>2021</b>\nIn March 2020, Connecticut opted to add a new Medicaid coverage group: the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured. Enrollment data on this limited-benefit Medicaid coverage group is being incorporated into Medicaid data effective January 1, 2021. \n\nEnrollment data for this coverage group prior to January 1, 2021, was listed under State Funded Medical. An historical accounting of enrollment of the specific coverage group starting in calendar year 2020 will also be published separately.\n\n<b>2018</b>\nOn April 22, 2019 the methodology for determining HUSKY A Newborn recipients changed, which caused an increase of recipients for that benefit starting in October 2016. We now count recipients recorded in the ImpaCT system as well as in the HIX system for that assistance type, instead using HIX exclusively.\n\nAlso, the methodology for determining the address of the recipients changed:\n1. The address of a recipient in the ImpaCT system is now correctly determined specific to that month instead of using the address of the most recent month. This resulted in some shuffling of the recipients among townships starting in October 2016.\n\n2. If, in a given month, a recipient has benefit records in both the HIX system and in the ImpaCT system, the address of the recipient is now calculated as follows to resolve conflicts: Use the residential address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the mailing address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the address in HIX. This resulted in a reduction in counts for most townships starting in March 2017 because a single address is now used instead of two when the systems do not agree.\n\nOn February 14, 2019 the enrollment counts for 2012-2015 across all programs were updated to account for an error in the data integration process. As a result, the count of the number of people served increased by 13% for 2012, 10% for 2013, 8% for 2014 and 4% for 2015. Counts for 2016, 2017 and 2018 remain unchanged.\n\nOn January 16, 2019 these counts were revised to count a recipient in all locations that recipient resided in that year.\n\nOn January 1, 2019 the counts were revised to count a recipient in only one town per year even when the recipient moved within the year.

All data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. Deaths reported to the either the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) or Department of Public Health (DPH) are included in the COVID-19 update.\n\nThe following data show the number of COVID-19 cases and associated deaths per 100,000 population by race and ethnicity. Crude rates represent the total cases or deaths per 100,000 people. Age-adjusted rates consider the age of the person at diagnosis or death when estimating the rate and use a standardized population to provide a fair comparison between population groups with different age distributions. Age-adjustment is important in Connecticut as the median age of among the non-Hispanic white population is 47 years, whereas it is 34 years among non-Hispanic blacks, and 29 years among Hispanics. Because most non-Hispanic white residents who died were over 75 years of age, the age-adjusted rates are lower than the unadjusted rates. In contrast, Hispanic residents who died tend to be younger than 75 years of age which results in higher age-adjusted rates.\n\nThe population data used to calculate rates is based on the CT DPH population statistics for 2019, which is available online here: https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Health-Information-Systems--Reporting/Population/Population-Statistics. Prior to 5/10/2021, the population estimates from 2018 were used.\n \nRates are standardized to the 2000 US Millions Standard population (data available here: https://seer.cancer.gov/stdpopulations/). Standardization was done using 19 age groups (0, 1-4, 5-9, 10-14, ..., 80-84, 85 years and older). More information about direct standardization for age adjustment is available here: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statnt/statnt06rv.pdf  \n\nCategories are mutually exclusive. The category \u201cmultiracial\u201d includes people who answered \u2018yes\u2019 to more than one race category. Counts may not add up to total case counts as data on race and ethnicity may be missing. Age adjusted rates calculated only for groups with more than 20 deaths. Abbreviation: NH=Non-Hispanic.\n\nData on Connecticut deaths were obtained from the Connecticut Deaths Registry maintained by the DPH Office of Vital Records.

COVID-19 vaccination reporting is expected to resume when a new COVID-19 vaccination formulation is authorized.</strong></p>\n\nAs 4/22/2023, CDC recommends bivalent vaccine for everyone regardless of age and whether or not the person has had prior monovalent vaccine. \n\nThis table shows the cumulative number and percentage of people who have received an updated (bivalent) COVID-19 vaccination by race/ethnicity and age group for people 5  years and over.\n\n\u2022\tData are reported weekly on Thursday and include doses administered to Saturday of the previous week. \n\n\u2022\tAll data in this report are preliminary.  Data for previous weeks may be changed because of delays in reporting, deduplication, or correction of errors.\n\n\u2022\tThe table groups people based on their current age and excludes people known to be deceased.\n\n\u2022\tThe analyses here are based on data reported to CT WiZ which is the immunization information system for CT. Connecticut COVID-19 Vaccine Program providers are required to report to CT WiZ all COVID-19 doses administered in CT including to CT residents and to residents of other jurisdictions. CT Wiz also receives records on CT residents vaccinated in other jurisdictions and by federal entities which share data with CT WiZ electronically (currently:  RI, NJ, New York City, DE, Philadelphia, NV, Indian Health Service, Department of Veterans Affairs (doses administered since 11/2022)).   Electronic data exchange is being added jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction.  Once a jurisdiction is added to CT WiZ, the records for residents of that jurisdiction vaccinated in CT are removed. For example, when CT residents vaccinated in NYC were added, NYC residents vaccinated in CT were removed.\n\n\u2022\tPopulation size estimates used to calculate cumulative percentages are based on 2020 DPH provisional census estimates*.\n\n\u2022\tRace and ethnicity data may be self-reported or taken from an existing electronic health care record. Reported race and ethnicity information is used to create a single race/ethnicity variable. People with Hispanic ethnicity are classified as Hispanic regardless of reported race. People with a missing ethnicity are classified as non-Hispanic. People with more than one race are classified as multiple races.\nA vaccine coverage percentage cannot be calculated for people classified as NH (non-Hispanic) Other race or NH Unknown race since there are no population size estimates for these groups. Data quality assurance activities suggest that in at least some cases NH Other may represent a missing value. Vaccine coverage estimates in specific race/ethnicity groups may be underestimated as result of the classification of records as NH Unknown Race or NH Other Race. \n\n\u2022\tCumulative percentage estimates have been capped at 100%.

Due to eligibility policies and operational processes, enrollment can vary slightly after publication. Please be aware of the point-in-time nature of the published data when comparing to other data published or shared by the Department of Social Services, as this data may vary slightly.\n\nAs a general practice, for monthly data sets published on the Open Data Portal, DSS will continue to refresh the monthly enrollment data for three months, after which time it will remain static. For example, when March data is published the data in January and February will be refreshed. When April data is published, February and March data will be refreshed, but January will not change. This allows the Department to account for the most common enrollment variations in published data while also ensuring that data remains as stable as possible over time. In the event of a significant change in enrollment data, the Department may republish reports and will notate such republication dates and reasons accordingly.\nIn March 2020, Connecticut opted to add a new Medicaid coverage group: the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured. Enrollment data on this limited-benefit Medicaid coverage group is being incorporated into Medicaid data effective January 1, 2021. Enrollment data for this coverage group prior to January 1, 2021, was listed under State Funded Medical. Effective January 1, 2021, this coverage group have been separated: (1) the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured is now G06-I and is now listed as a limited benefit plan that rolls up into \u201cProgram Name\u201d of Medicaid and \u201cMedical Benefit Plan\u201d of HUSKY Limited Benefit; (2) the emergency medical coverage has been separated into G06-II as a limited benefit plan that rolls up into \u201cProgram Name\u201d of Emergency Medical and \u201cMedical Benefit Plan\u201d of Other Medical. An historical accounting of enrollment of the specific coverage group starting in calendar year 2020 will also be published separately.\nThis data represents number of active recipients who received benefits under a medical benefit plan in that calendar year and month. A recipient may have received benefits from multiple plans in the same month; if so that recipient will be included in multiple categories in this dataset (counted more than once.)\n2021 is a partial year.\nFor privacy considerations, a count of zero is used for counts less than five.\nNOTE: On April 22, 2019 the methodology for determining HUSKY A Newborn recipients changed, which caused an increase of recipients for that benefit starting in October 2016. We now count recipients recorded in the ImpaCT system as well as in the HIX system for that assistance type, instead using HIX exclusively.\nAlso, corrections in the ImpaCT system for January and February 2019 caused the addition of around 2000 and 3000 recipients respectively, and the counts for many types of assistance (e.g. SNAP) were adjusted upward for those 2 months.\nAlso, the methodology for determining the address of the recipients changed:\n    1. The address of a recipient in the ImpaCT system is now correctly determined specific to that month instead of using the address of the most recent month. This resulted in some shuffling of the recipients among townships starting in October 2016.\n    2. If, in a given month, a recipient has benefit records in both the HIX system and in the ImpaCT system, the address of the recipient is now calculated as follows to resolve conflicts: Use the residential address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the mailing address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the address in HIX.

Dates are based on date of specimen collection (cases and positivity).\n\nA person is considered a new case only upon their first COVID-19 testing result because a case is defined as an instance or bout of illness. If they are tested again subsequently and are still positive, it still counts toward the test positivity metric but they are not considered another case.\n\nThese case and test counts do not include cases or tests among people residing in congregate settings, such as nursing homes, assisted living facilities, or correctional facilities.\n\nThese data are updated weekly and reflect the previous two full Sunday-Saturday (MMWR) weeks (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/MMWR_week_overview.pdf).\n\nDPH note about change from 7-day to 14-day metrics: \nPrior to 10/15/2020, these metrics were calculated using a 7-day average rather than a 14-day average. The 7-day metrics are no longer being updated as of 10/15/2020 but the archived dataset can be accessed here: https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-case-rate-per-100-000-population-and-perc/s22x-83rd\n\nAs you know, we are learning more about COVID-19 all the time, including the best ways to measure COVID-19 activity in our communities. CT DPH has decided to shift to 14-day rates because these are more stable, particularly at the town level, as compared to 7-day rates. In addition, since the school indicators were initially published by DPH last summer, CDC has recommended 14-day rates and other states (e.g., Massachusetts) have started to implement 14-day metrics for monitoring COVID transmission as well. \n \nWith respect to geography, we also have learned that many people are looking at the town-level data to inform decision making, despite emphasis on the county-level metrics in the published addenda.

To protect confidentiality, if a town has fewer than 5 cases or positive NAAT tests over the past 7 days, those data will be suppressed.\n\nCount of COVID-19-associated deaths by date of death. Deaths reported to either the OCME or DPH are included in the COVID-19 data. COVID-19-associated deaths include persons who tested positive for COVID-19 around the time of death and persons who were not tested for COVID-19 whose death certificate lists COVID-19 disease as a cause of death or a significant condition contributing to death.\n\nData on Connecticut deaths were obtained from the Connecticut Deaths Registry maintained by the DPH Office of Vital Records. Cause of death was determined by a death certifier (e.g., physician, APRN, medical examiner) using their best clinical judgment. Additionally, all COVID-19 deaths, including suspected or related, are required to be reported to OCME. On April 4, 2020, CT DPH and OCME released a joint memo to providers and facilities within Connecticut providing guidelines for certifying deaths due to COVID-19 that were consistent with the CDC\u2019s guidelines and a reminder of the required reporting to OCME.25,26  As of July 1, 2021, OCME had reviewed every case reported and performed additional investigation on about one-third of reported deaths to better ascertain if COVID-19 did or did not cause or contribute to the death. Some of these investigations resulted in the OCME performing postmortem swabs for PCR testing on individuals whose deaths were suspected to be due to COVID-19, but antemortem diagnosis was unable to be made.31  The OCME issued or re-issued about 10% of COVID-19 death certificates and, when appropriate, removed COVID-19 from the death certificate. For standardization and tabulation of mortality statistics, written cause of death statements made by the certifiers on death certificates are sent to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the CDC which assigns cause of death codes according to the International Causes of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) classification system.25,26  COVID-19 deaths in this report are defined as those for which the death certificate has an ICD-10 code of U07.1 as either a primary (underlying) or a contributing cause of death.

To protect confidentiality, if a town has fewer than 5 cases or positive NAAT tests over the past 7 days, those data will be suppressed.\n\nCOVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and associated deaths that have been reported among Connecticut residents. All data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. Hospitalization data were collected by the Connecticut Hospital Association and reflect the number of patients currently hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Deaths reported to the either the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) or Department of Public Health (DPH) are included in the daily COVID-19 update. \n\nData on Connecticut deaths were obtained from the Connecticut Deaths Registry maintained by the DPH Office of Vital Records. Cause of death was determined by a death certifier (e.g., physician, APRN, medical examiner) using their best clinical judgment. Additionally, all COVID-19 deaths, including suspected or related, are required to be reported to OCME. On April 4, 2020, CT DPH and OCME released a joint memo to providers and facilities within Connecticut providing guidelines for certifying deaths due to COVID-19 that were consistent with the CDC\u2019s guidelines and a reminder of the required reporting to OCME.25,26  As of July 1, 2021, OCME had reviewed every case reported and performed additional investigation on about one-third of reported deaths to better ascertain if COVID-19 did or did not cause or contribute to the death. Some of these investigations resulted in the OCME performing postmortem swabs for PCR testing on individuals whose deaths were suspected to be due to COVID-19, but antemortem diagnosis was unable to be made.31  The OCME issued or re-issued about 10% of COVID-19 death certificates and, when appropriate, removed COVID-19 from the death certificate. For standardization and tabulation of mortality statistics, written cause of death statements made by the certifiers on death certificates are sent to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the CDC which assigns cause of death codes according to the International Causes of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) classification system.25,26  COVID-19 deaths in this report are defined as those for which the death certificate has an ICD-10 code of U07.1 as either a primary (underlying) or a contributing cause of death.

Due to eligibility policies and operational processes, enrollment can vary slightly after publication. Please be aware of the point-in-time nature of the published data when comparing to other data published or shared by the Department of Social Services, as this data may vary slightly.\n\nAs a general practice, for monthly data sets published on the Open Data Portal, DSS will continue to refresh the monthly enrollment data for three months, after which time it will remain static. For example, when March data is published the data in January and February will be refreshed. When April data is published, February and March data will be refreshed, but January will not change. This allows the Department to account for the most common enrollment variations in published data while also ensuring that data remains as stable as possible over time. In the event of a significant change in enrollment data, the Department may republish reports and will notate such republication dates and reasons accordingly.\nIn March 2020, Connecticut opted to add a new Medicaid coverage group: the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured. Enrollment data on this limited-benefit Medicaid coverage group is being incorporated into Medicaid data effective January 1, 2021. Enrollment data for this coverage group prior to January 1, 2021, was listed under State Funded Medical. Effective January 1, 2021, this coverage group have been separated: (1) the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured is now G06-I and is now listed as a limited benefit plan that rolls up into \u201cProgram Name\u201d of Medicaid and \u201cMedical Benefit Plan\u201d of HUSKY Limited Benefit; (2) the emergency medical coverage has been separated into G06-II as a limited benefit plan that rolls up into \u201cProgram Name\u201d of Emergency Medical and \u201cMedical Benefit Plan\u201d of Other Medical.

For example, when March data is published the data in January and February will be refreshed. When April data is published, February and March data will be refreshed, but January will not change. This allows the Department to account for the most common enrollment variations in published data while also ensuring that data remains as stable as possible over time. In the event of a significant change in enrollment data, the Department may republish reports and will notate such republication dates and reasons accordingly.\nIn March 2020, Connecticut opted to add a new Medicaid coverage group: the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured.

Hospitalization data come from the Connecticut Hospital Association and are based on hospital location, not county of patient residence. COVID-19-like illness includes fever and cough or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing or the presence of coronavirus diagnosis code and excludes patients with influenza-like illness. All data are preliminary.\n\nThese data are updated weekly and reflect the previous two full Sunday-Saturday (MMWR) weeks (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/MMWR_week_overview.pdf). \n\nThese metrics were adapted from recommendations by the Harvard Global Institute and supplemented by existing DPH measures. \n\nFor national data on COVID-19, see COVID View, the national weekly surveillance summary of U.S. COVID-19 activity, at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html\n\nDPH note about change from 7-day to 14-day metrics: \nPrior to 10/15/2020, these metrics were calculated using a 7-day average rather than a 14-day average.

In addition, since the school indicators were initially published by DPH last summer, CDC has recommended 14-day rates and other states (e.g., Massachusetts) have started to implement 14-day metrics for monitoring COVID transmission as well. \n \nWith respect to geography, we also have learned that many people are looking at the town-level data to inform decision making, despite emphasis on the county-level metrics in the published addenda.

It also shows the number of people who have not received vaccine and who are not yet fully vaccinated.  \n\nAll data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. \n \nA person who has received at least one dose of any vaccine is considered to have initiated vaccination. A person is considered fully vaccinated if they have completed a primary series by receiving 2 doses of the Pfizer, Novavax or Moderna vaccines or 1 dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The fully vaccinated are a subset of the number who have received at least one dose. \n\nThe percent with at least one dose many be over-estimated and the percent fully vaccinated may be under-estimated because of vaccine administration records for individuals that cannot be linked because of differences in how names or date of birth are reported.\n\nPopulation data obtained from the 2019 Census ACS (www.census.gov) \nGeocoding is used to determine the census tract in which a person lives.  People for who a census tract cannot be determined based on available address data are not included in this table. DPH recommends that these data are primarily used to identify areas that require additional attention rather than to establish and track the exact level of vaccine coverage. Census tract coverage estimates can play an important role in planning and evaluating vaccination strategies. However, inaccuracies in the data that are inherent to population surveillance may be magnified when analyses are performed down to the census tract level. We make every effort to provide accurate data, but inaccuracies may result from things like incomplete or inaccurate addresses, duplicate records, and sampling error in the American Community Survey that is used to estimate census tract population size and composition. These things may result in overestimates or underestimates of vaccine coverage.\n\nSome census tracts are suppressed. This is done if the number of people vaccinated is less than 5 or if the census population estimate is considered unreliable (coefficient of variance > 30%). Coverage estimates over 100% are shown as 100%.   \nConnecticut COVID-19 Vaccine Program providers are required to report information on all COVID-19 vaccine doses administered to CT WiZ, the Connecticut Immunization Information System. Data on doses administered to CT residents out-of-state are being added to CT WiZ jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction. Doses administered by some Federal entities (including Department of Defense, Department of Correction, Department of Veteran\u2019s Affairs, Indian Health Service) are not yet reported to CT WiZ.  Data reported here reflect the vaccination records currently reported to CT WiZ.\nCaution should be used when interpreting coverage estimates in towns with large college/university populations since coverage may be underestimated.

COVP Coverage data suppressed if the any of the following conditions were met:\n-Coefficient of Variation of Denominator is > 30%\t\n-Numerator is <5\n-Population is estimated to be 0 (zero)\n\nPopulation data obtained from the 2019 Census ACS (www.census.gov)\n\nDPH recommends that these data are primarily used to identify areas that require additional attention rather than to establish and track the exact level of vaccine coverage.   \n\nAll analyses are provisional and subject to change. \n\nCensus tract coverage estimates can play an important role in planning and evaluating vaccination strategies. However, inaccuracies in the data that are inherent to population surveillance may be magnified when analyses are performed on population subgroups within census tracts. We make every effort to provide accurate data, but inaccuracies may result from things like incomplete or inaccurate addresses, duplicate records, and sampling error in the American Community Survey that is used to estimate census tract population size and composition.  These things may result in overestimates or underestimates of vaccine coverage.  \n\nSome census tracts are suppressed. This is done if the number of people vaccinated is less than 5 or if the census population estimate is considered to be unreliable (coefficient of variance > 30%). Coverage estimates over 100% are shown as 100%. We suggest that the data are used primarily to identify areas that require additional attention rather than to establish and track the exact level of vaccine coverage.

{"resource": {"name": "DSS - People Served by Town and Type of Assistance (TOA) by Month - CY 2023", "id": "g7bd-zbqw", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "In order to facilitate public review and access, enrollment data published on the Open Data Portal is provided as promptly as possible after the end of each month or year, as applicable to the data set. Due to eligibility policies and operational processes, enrollment can vary slightly after publication. Please be aware of the point-in-time nature of the published data when comparing to other data published or shared by the Department of Social Services, as this data may vary slightly.\n\nAs a general practice, for monthly data sets published on the Open Data Portal, DSS will continue to refresh the monthly enrollment data for three months, after which time it will remain static. For example, when March data is published the data in January and February will be refreshed. When April data is published, February and March data will be refreshed, but January will not change. This allows the Department to account for the most common enrollment variations in published data while also ensuring that data remains as stable as possible over time. In the event of a significant change in enrollment data, the Department may republish reports and will notate such republication dates and reasons accordingly.\nIn March 2020, Connecticut opted to add a new Medicaid coverage group: the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured. Enrollment data on this limited-benefit Medicaid coverage group is being incorporated into Medicaid data effective January 1, 2021. Enrollment data for this coverage group prior to January 1, 2021, was listed under State Funded Medical. Effective January 1, 2021, this coverage group have been separated: (1) the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured is now G06-I and is now listed as a limited benefit plan that rolls up into \u201cProgram Name\u201d of Medicaid and \u201cMedical Benefit Plan\u201d of HUSKY Limited Benefit; (2) the emergency medical coverage has been separated into G06-II as a limited benefit plan that rolls up into \u201cProgram Name\u201d of Emergency Medical and \u201cMedical Benefit Plan\u201d of Other Medical. An historical accounting of enrollment of the specific coverage group starting in calendar year 2020 will also be published separately.\nThe data represents number of active recipients who received benefits from a type of assistance (TOA) in that calendar year and month. A recipient may have received benefits from multiple TOAs in the same month; if so that recipient will be included in multiple categories in this dataset (counted more than once.) \nFor privacy considerations, a count of zero is used for counts less than five.\n\nThe methodology for determining the address of the recipients changed:\n    1. The address of a recipient in the ImpaCT system is now correctly determined specific to that month instead of using the address of the most recent month.

Enrollment data on this limited-benefit Medicaid coverage group is being incorporated into Medicaid data effective January 1, 2021. \n\nEnrollment data for this coverage group prior to January 1, 2021, was listed under State Funded Medical. An historical accounting of enrollment of the specific coverage group starting in calendar year 2020 will also be published separately.\n\n<b>2018</b>\nOn April 22, 2019 the methodology for determining HUSKY A Newborn recipients changed, which caused an increase of recipients for that benefit starting in October 2016. We now count recipients recorded in the ImpaCT system as well as in the HIX system for that assistance type, instead using HIX exclusively.\n\nAlso, the methodology for determining the address of the recipients changed:\n1. The address of a recipient in the ImpaCT system is now correctly determined specific to that month instead of using the address of the most recent month. This resulted in some shuffling of the recipients among townships starting in October 2016.\n\n2. If, in a given month, a recipient has benefit records in both the HIX system and in the ImpaCT system, the address of the recipient is now calculated as follows to resolve conflicts: Use the residential address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the mailing address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the address in HIX.

As a result, the count of the number of people served increased by 13% for 2012, 10% for 2013, 8% for 2014 and 4% for 2015. Counts for 2016, 2017 and 2018 remain unchanged.\n\nOn January 16, 2019 these counts were revised to count a recipient in all locations that recipient resided in that year.\n\nOn January 1, 2019 the counts were revised to count a recipient in only one town per year even when the recipient moved within the year.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Vaccinations by Town and Age Group - ARCHIVED", "id": "gngw-ukpw", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "NOTE:  As of 2/16/2023, this table is not being updated.  For data on COVID-19 updated (bivalent) booster coverage by town please to go to https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-Updated-Bivalent-Booster-Coverage-By-Town/bqd5-4jgh. \n\nThis table shows the number and percent of residents of each CT town that have initiated COVID-19 vaccination, are fully vaccinated and who have received additional dose 1 by age group.  \n \nAll data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. \n\nIn the data shown here, a person who has received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have initiated vaccination. A person is considered fully vaccinated if he/she has completed a primary vaccination series by receiving 2 doses of the Pfizer, Novavax or Moderna vaccines or 1 dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The fully vaccinated are a subset of the people who have received at least one dose.\n \nA person who completed a Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax or Johnson & Johnson primary series (as defined above) and then had an additional monovalent dose of COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have had additional dose 1. The additional dose may be Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax or Johnson & Johnson and may be a different type from the primary series.  For people who had a primary Pfizer or Moderna series, additional dose 1 was counted starting August 18th, 2021. For people with a Johnson & Johnson primary series additional dose 1 was counted starting October 22nd, 2021. For most people, additional dose 1 is a booster. However, additional dose 1 may represent a supplement to the primary series for a people who is moderately or severely immunosuppressed. Bivalent booster administrations are not included in the additional dose 1 calculations. \n\nThe percent with at least one dose many be over-estimated, and the percent fully vaccinated and with additional dose 1 may be under-estimated because of vaccine administration records for individuals that cannot be linked because of differences in how names or date of birth are reported. \n\nTown of residence is verified by geocoding the reported address and then mapping it a town using municipal boundaries.  If an address cannot be geocoded, the reported town is used.  Out-of-state residents vaccinated by CT providers are excluded from the table.     \n\nThe population denominators for these town- and age-specific coverage estimates are based on 2014 census estimates. This is the most recent year for which reliable town- and age-specific estimates are available. (https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Health-Information-Systems--Reporting/Population/Town-Population-with-Demographics). This census data is grouped in 5-year age bands. For vaccine coverage age groupings not consistent with a standard 5-year age band, each age was assumed to be 20% of the total within a 5-year age band. However, given the large deviation from this assumption for Mansfield because of the presence of the University of Connecticut, the age distribution observed in the 2010 census for the age bands 15 to 19 and 20 to 24 was used to estimate the population denominators. \n\nTown-level coverage estimates have been capped at 100%.  Observed coverage may be greater than 100% for multiple reasons, including census denominator data not including all individuals that currently reside in the town (e.g., part time residents, change in population size since the census), errors in address data or other reporting errors.  \n\nCaution should be used when interpreting coverage estimates for towns with large college/university populations since coverage may be underestimated. In the census, college/university students who live on or just off campus would be counted in the college/university town. However, if a student was vaccinated while studying remotely in his/her hometown, the student may be counted as a vaccine recipient in that town. \n\nConnecticut COVID-19 Vaccine Program p", "attribution": "Department of Public Health", "attribution_link": "https://portal.ct.gov/DPH", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-08-02T16:19:45.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-04-23T13:40:45.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-08-02T16:19:45.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-09T19:38:59.000Z", "columns_name": ["Additional Dose 1 Received Percent", "Additional Dose 1 Received Count", "Date Updated", "Fully Vaccinated Percent", "Fully Vaccinated Count", "Initiated Vaccination Percent", "Initiated Vaccination Count", "Population", "At least one census tract SVI\u22650.75", "Age Group", "Town"], "columns_field_name": ["additional_dose_1_received_percent", "additional_dose_1_received", "dateupdated", "fully_vaccinated_percent", "fully_vaccinated", "initiated_vaccination_percent", "initiated_vaccination", "population", "at_least_one_census_tract", "age_group", "town"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Additional Dose 1 Received Percent", "Additional Dose 1 Received Count", "Date updated", "Fully vaccinated percent", "Fully vaccinated count", "Initiated vaccination percent", "Initiated vaccination count", "Estimated population", "Yes/no: Indicates whether or not each town has at least one census tract with a Social Vulnerability index 75% or greater", "Age group", "Town name"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {"view": "date"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-04-27T13:34:40.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Health and Human Services", "domain_tags": ["covid-19", "covid archive", "covid vaccination"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Agency_Agency", "value": "Department of Public Health"}, {"key": "Details_Geographic-Unit", "value": "Municipality"}, {"key": "Details_Update-Frequency", "value": "Not updated (historical data)"}, {"key": "Details_Temporal-Coverage", "value": "The COVID-19 Pandemic"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.ct.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.ct.gov/d/gngw-ukpw", "link": "https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-Vaccinations-by-Town-and-Age-Group-ARCHIV/gngw-ukpw", "owner": {"id": "dby8-627v", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Gary Archambault"}, "creator": {"id": "dby8-627v", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Gary Archambault"}}

Examples include:\n\u2022         Manifests completed incorrectly by the generator or the transporter - data was entered based on the incorrect information. We can only enter the information we receive.\n\u2022         Data entry errors \u2013 we now have QA/QC procedures in place to prevent or catch and fix a lot of these.\n\u2022         Historically there are multiple records of the same generator.  Each variation in spelling in name or address generated a separate handler record.  We have worked to minimize these but many remain.  The good news is that as long as they all have the same EPA ID they will all show up in your search results.\n\u2022         Handlers provide erroneous data to obtain an EPA ID - data entry was based on erroneous information.  Examples include incorrect or bogus addresses and names. There are also a lot of MISSPELLED NAMES AND ADDRESSES!\n\u2022         Missing manifests \u2013 Not every required manifest gets submitted to DEEP. Also, of the more than 100,000 paper manifests we receive each year, some were incorrectly handled and never entered.\n\u2022         Missing data \u2013 we know that the records for approximately 25 boxes of manifests, mostly prior to 1985 were lost from the database in the 1980\u2019s. \n\u2022         Translation errors \u2013 the data has been migrated to newer data platforms numerous times, and each time there have been errors and data losses.\n\u2022         Wastes incorrectly entered \u2013 mostly due to complex names that were difficult to spell, or typos in quantities or units of measure.\n\nSince Summer 2019, scanned images of manifest hardcopies may be viewed at the DEEP Document Online Search Portal:  https://filings.deep.ct.gov/DEEPDocumentSearchPortal/", "attribution": "Department of Energy and Environmental Protection", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-01-13T12:06:45.000Z", "createdAt": "2016-08-16T20:11:17.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-09-18T19:27:07.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-01-13T12:06:45.000Z", "columns_name": ["recdate", "genmailtown", "tran2name", "tran1state", "tran1town", "tran1name", "gensitetown", "genname", "tran2town", "tran1zipcode", "tsdftown", "qty", "contty", "dtshipp", "manifest", "tran2state", "tran2streetaddress", "genmailzipcode", "genmailstate", "tsdfstreetaddress", "tsdfname", "tsdfstate", "tsdfzipcode", "gensitestreetaddress", "wtvol", "genmailaddress", "epa-waste-codes", "tran2country", "tran1streetaddress", "tsdfepa", "copies", "contno", "batch-numbers", "altfaczip", "tran2zipcode", "uniqueKey", "tr2date", "tran2epa", "usdot", "genepa", "discrep", "wasteoccr", "altfacstate", "tran1epa", "altfacepa", "tran1country", "altfactown", "altfacdate", "altfacname", "tsdfcountry", "gensitezipcode", "altfacstreetaddress"], "columns_field_name": ["recdate", "genmailtown", "tran2name", "tran1state", "tran1town", "tran1name", "gensitetown", "genname", "tran2town", "tran1zipcode", "tsdftown", "qty", "contty", "dtshipp", "manifest", "tran2state", "tran2streetaddress", "genmailzipcode", "genmailstate", "tsdfstreetaddress", "tsdfname", "tsdfstate", "tsdfzipcode", "gensitestreetaddress", "wtvol", "genmailaddress", "epa_waste_codes", "tran2country", "tran1streetaddress", "tsdfepa", "copies", "contno", "batch_numbers", "altfaczip", "tran2zipcode", "uniquekey", "tr2date", "tran2epa", "usdot", "genepa", "discrep", "wasteoccr", "altfacstate", "tran1epa", "altfacepa", "tran1country", "altfactown", "altfacdate", "altfacname", "tsdfcountry", "gensitezipcode", "altfacstreetaddress"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "Town of Generator Site", "Generator Name", "", "", "", "", "", "Shipment Date", "Manifest ID Number", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "Street Address of Generator Site", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "For DEEP document storage only", "", "", "The Unique Key field is used to update the dataset.

As of 6/27/2022, the data will be published in four tables instead of twelve.\n\nThe COVID-19 Cases, Deaths, and Tests by Day dataset contains cases and test data by date of sample submission.

The data can be found at https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-Town-Level-Data/icxw-cada .   To protect confidentiality, if a town has fewer than 5 cases or positive NAAT tests over the past 7 days, those data will be suppressed.\n\nThis dataset includes a count and rate per 100,000 population for COVID-19 cases, a count of COVID-19 molecular diagnostic tests, and a percent positivity rate for tests among people living in community settings for the previous two-week period. Dates are based on date of specimen collection (cases and positivity).\n\nA person is considered a new case only upon their first COVID-19 testing result because a case is defined as an instance or bout of illness. If they are tested again subsequently and are still positive, it still counts toward the test positivity metric but they are not considered another case.\n\nPercent positivity is calculated as the number of positive tests among community residents conducted during the 14 days divided by the total number of positive and negative tests among community residents during the same period.  If someone was tested more than once during that 14 day period, then those multiple test results (regardless of whether they were positive or negative) are included in the calculation.\n\nThese case and test counts do not include cases or tests among people residing in congregate settings, such as nursing homes, assisted living facilities, or correctional facilities.\n\nThese data are updated weekly and reflect the previous two full Sunday-Saturday (MMWR) weeks (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/MMWR_week_overview.pdf).\n\nDPH note about change from 7-day to 14-day metrics:\nPrior to 10/15/2020, these metrics were calculated using a 7-day average rather than a 14-day average. The 7-day metrics are no longer being updated as of 10/15/2020 but the archived dataset can be accessed here: https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-case-rate-per-100-000-population-and-perc/s22x-83rd\n\nAs you know, we are learning more about COVID-19 all the time, including the best ways to measure COVID-19 activity in our communities. CT DPH has decided to shift to 14-day rates because these are more stable, particularly at the town level, as compared to 7-day rates. In addition, since the school indicators were initially published by DPH last summer, CDC has recommended 14-day rates and other states (e.g., Massachusetts) have started to implement 14-day metrics for monitoring COVID transmission as well.\n\nWith respect to geography, we also have learned that many people are looking at the town-level data to inform decision making, despite emphasis on the county-level metrics in the published addenda.

The survey collects vaccination and exemption status data on children who entered the school system on or before a specified date during the fall semester. Individual vaccine information on each student is not collected.\n\nThis table shows the percentage of kindergarten students vaccinated for each school-entry mandated vaccine series and the percentage with vaccination exemptions (medical or religious) reported by school. Percentage of students vaccinated is the number of students with the required number of doses of a given vaccine divided by the total number of students. Data includes all schools who reported students in kindergarten.\n\nSchool-mandated vaccine series for students enrolled in kindergarten are inactivated polio, DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis), MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), hepatitis B, varicella, and hepatitis A.\n\nEach child has 1 of 4 possible vaccination statutes: Vaccinated, Exempt (Religious), Exempt (Medical) or Non-compliant. The criteria shown below are used to assess whether a child is considered vaccinated.\n\n\u2022 Polio = at least 3 doses of inactivated polio vaccine, with the last dose on or after their 4th birthday. This is a school entry requirement starting in kindergarten.\n\u2022 DTaP = at least 4 doses of DTaP vaccine, with the last dose on or after their 4th birthday. This is a school entry requirement starting in kindergarten.\n\u2022 MMR = at least 2 doses of MMR vaccine separated by at least 28 days, with the 1st dose on or after their 1st birthday. This is a school entry requirement starting in kindergarten.\n\u2022 HepB = at least 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine, with the last dose on or after 24 weeks of age. This is a school entry requirement starting in kindergarten.\n\u2022 Varicella = at least 2 doses of varicella vaccine separated by at least 28 days, with the 1st dose on or after their 1st birthday, or a reliable history of chickenpox disease. This is a school entry requirement starting in kindergarten.\n\u2022 HepA = at least 2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine, given a minimum of six calendar months apart, with the 1st dose on or after their 1st birthday. This is a school entry requirement starting in kindergarten.\n\u2022 All = Percentage of students with all above vaccine series required for that grade level.\n\nChildren without a record of vaccination, but with serologic proof of immunity to certain diseases (measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, hepatitis A, and varicella), meet school entry requirements and may be counted as vaccinated.\n\nThe values for schools with fewer than 30 enrolled kindergarteners are suppressed, and those fields are left blank.\n\u2003\nData Limitations and Considerations:\n\u2022 The school level data shown here are as tabulated and reported by schools and discrepancies may exist.\n\u2022 The Immunization Program identifies outliers and internally inconsistent data points and works with schools to resolve any data quality issues, when possible.\n\u2022 CT DPH cannot verify the accuracy of vaccine data for individual children or whether the documentation necessary to claim an exemption has been submitted.\n\u2022 Data are collected at the beginning of the school year, by which time vaccines are due. As the year progresses, immunization rates may increase as additional children receive required immunizations. Additionally, the student body is dynamic and as students arrive and leave school, the immunization rates are impacted.\n\u2022 Vaccine status is assessed on the level of the child and not on each vaccine. Once a child is listed as exempt, vaccination data is no longer collected in the survey for that child.

Data for previous weeks may be changed because of delays in reporting, deduplication, or correction of errors. \n\n\u2022\tThe table groups people based on their current age and excludes people known to be deceased. \n\n\u2022\tThe analyses here are based on data reported to CT WiZ which is the immunization information system for CT. Connecticut COVID-19 Vaccine Program providers are required to report to CT WiZ all COVID-19 doses administered in CT including to CT residents and to residents of other jurisdictions. CT Wiz also receives records on CT residents vaccinated in other jurisdictions and by federal entities which share data with CT WiZ electronically (currently:  RI, NJ, New York City, DE, Philadelphia, NV, Indian Health Service, Department of Veterans Affairs (doses administered since 11/2022)).   Electronic data exchange is being added jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction.  Once a jurisdiction is added to CT WiZ, the records for residents of that jurisdiction vaccinated in CT are removed. For example, when CT residents vaccinated in NYC were added, NYC residents vaccinated in CT were removed.\n\n\u2022\tPopulation size estimates used to calculate cumulative percentages are based on 2020 DPH provisional census estimates**.\n\n\u2022\tCumulative percentage estimates have been capped at 100%.

Enrollment data on this limited-benefit Medicaid coverage group is being incorporated into Medicaid data effective January 1, 2021. \n\nEnrollment data for this coverage group prior to January 1, 2021, was listed under State Funded Medical. An historical accounting of enrollment of the specific coverage group starting in calendar year 2020 will also be published separately.\n\n<b>2018</b>\nOn April 22, 2019 the methodology for determining HUSKY A Newborn recipients changed, which caused an increase of recipients for that benefit starting in October 2016. We now count recipients recorded in the ImpaCT system as well as in the HIX system for that assistance type, instead using HIX exclusively.\n\nAlso, the methodology for determining the address of the recipients changed:\n1. The address of a recipient in the ImpaCT system is now correctly determined specific to that month instead of using the address of the most recent month. This resulted in some shuffling of the recipients among townships starting in October 2016.\n\n2. If, in a given month, a recipient has benefit records in both the HIX system and in the ImpaCT system, the address of the recipient is now calculated as follows to resolve conflicts: Use the residential address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the mailing address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the address in HIX. This resulted in a reduction in counts for most townships starting in March 2017 because a single address is now used instead of two when the systems do not agree.\n\nOn February 14, 2019 the enrollment counts for 2012-2015 across all programs were updated to account for an error in the data integration process. As a result, the count of the number of people served increased by 13% for 2012, 10% for 2013, 8% for 2014 and 4% for 2015. Counts for 2016, 2017 and 2018 remain unchanged.\n\nOn January 16, 2019 these counts were revised to count a recipient in all locations that recipient resided in that year.\n\nOn January 1, 2019 the counts were revised to count a recipient in only one town per year even when the recipient moved within the year.

{"resource": {"name": "All-Transactions House Price Index for Connecticut", "id": "kf98-j89e", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "The FHFA House Price Index (FHFA HPI\u00ae) is the nation\u2019s only collection of public, freely available house price indexes that measure changes in single-family home values based on data from all 50 states and over 400 American cities that extend back to the mid-1970s.  The FHFA HPI incorporates tens of millions of home sales and offers insights about house price fluctuations at the national, census division, state, metro area, county, ZIP code, and census tract levels.  FHFA uses a fully transparent methodology based upon a weighted, repeat-sales statistical technique to analyze house price transaction data.\n\u200b\nWhat does the FHFA HPI represent?\nThe FHFA HPI is a broad measure of the movement of single-family house prices. The FHFA HPI is a weighted, repeat-sales index, meaning that it measures average price changes in repeat sales or refinancings on the same properties. This information is obtained by reviewing repeat mortgage transactions on single-family properties whose mortgages have been purchased or securitized by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac since January 1975.\n\nThe FHFA HPI serves as a timely, accurate indicator of house price trends at various geographic levels. Because of the breadth of the sample, it provides more information than is available in other house price indexes. It also provides housing economists with an improved analytical tool that is useful for estimating changes in the rates of mortgage defaults, prepayments and housing affordability in specific geographic areas.\n\nU.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency, All-Transactions House Price Index for Connecticut [CTSTHPI], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CTSTHPI, August 2, 2023.", "attribution": "U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency and Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis", "attribution_link": "https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CTSTHPI", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-01-13T12:30:08.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-04-06T20:43:23.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:13:54.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-01-13T12:30:08.000Z", "columns_name": ["date", "FHFA House Price Index for Connecticut"], "columns_field_name": ["observation_date", "ctsthpi"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Date", "FHFA House Price Index for Connecticut (CTSTHPI)"], "columns_format": [{"view": "date"}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2021-04-06T20:45:01.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["health"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Housing and Development", "domain_tags": ["economic recovery", "housing", "housing price index"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Agency_Agency", "value": "Other Agency"}, {"key": "Details_Geographic-Unit", "value": "State"}, {"key": "Details_Update-Frequency", "value": "Quarterly"}, {"key": "Details_Temporal-Coverage", "value": "1975-2023"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.ct.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.ct.gov/d/kf98-j89e", "link": "https://data.ct.gov/Housing-and-Development/All-Transactions-House-Price-Index-for-Connecticut/kf98-j89e", "owner": {"id": "284p-w6j7", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "OPM Data and Policy Analytics"}, "creator": {"id": "284p-w6j7", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "OPM Data and Policy Analytics"}}

All data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. Deaths reported to the either the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) or Department of Public Health (DPH) are included in the daily COVID-19 update. \n\nData on Connecticut deaths were obtained from the Connecticut Deaths Registry maintained by the DPH Office of Vital Records. Cause of death was determined by a death certifier (e.g., physician, APRN, medical examiner) using their best clinical judgment. Additionally, all COVID-19 deaths, including suspected or related, are required to be reported to OCME. On April 4, 2020, CT DPH and OCME released a joint memo to providers and facilities within Connecticut providing guidelines for certifying deaths due to COVID-19 that were consistent with the CDC\u2019s guidelines and a reminder of the required reporting to OCME.25,26  As of July 1, 2021, OCME had reviewed every case reported and performed additional investigation on about one-third of reported deaths to better ascertain if COVID-19 did or did not cause or contribute to the death. Some of these investigations resulted in the OCME performing postmortem swabs for PCR testing on individuals whose deaths were suspected to be due to COVID-19, but antemortem diagnosis was unable to be made.31  The OCME issued or re-issued about 10% of COVID-19 death certificates and, when appropriate, removed COVID-19 from the death certificate. For standardization and tabulation of mortality statistics, written cause of death statements made by the certifiers on death certificates are sent to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the CDC which assigns cause of death codes according to the International Causes of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) classification system.25,26  COVID-19 deaths in this report are defined as those for which the death certificate has an ICD-10 code of U07.1 as either a primary (underlying) or a contributing cause of death.

Connecticut COVID-19 Vaccine Program providers are required to report to CT WiZ all COVID-19 doses administered in CT including to CT residents and to residents of other jurisdictions. CT Wiz also receives records on CT residents vaccinated in other jurisdictions and by federal entities which share data with CT WiZ electronically (currently:  RI, NJ, New York City, DE, Philadelphia, NV, Indian Health Service, Department of Veterans Affairs (doses administered since 11/2022)).

Enrollment data on this limited-benefit Medicaid coverage group is being incorporated into Medicaid data effective January 1, 2021. \n\nEnrollment data for this coverage group prior to January 1, 2021, was listed under State Funded Medical. An historical accounting of enrollment of the specific coverage group starting in calendar year 2020 will also be published separately.\n\n<b>2018</b>\nOn April 22, 2019 the methodology for determining HUSKY A Newborn recipients changed, which caused an increase of recipients for that benefit starting in October 2016. We now count recipients recorded in the ImpaCT system as well as in the HIX system for that assistance type, instead using HIX exclusively.\n\nAlso, the methodology for determining the address of the recipients changed:\n1. The address of a recipient in the ImpaCT system is now correctly determined specific to that month instead of using the address of the most recent month. This resulted in some shuffling of the recipients among townships starting in October 2016.\n\n2. If, in a given month, a recipient has benefit records in both the HIX system and in the ImpaCT system, the address of the recipient is now calculated as follows to resolve conflicts: Use the residential address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the mailing address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the address in HIX. This resulted in a reduction in counts for most townships starting in March 2017 because a single address is now used instead of two when the systems do not agree.\n\nOn February 14, 2019 the enrollment counts for 2012-2015 across all programs were updated to account for an error in the data integration process. As a result, the count of the number of people served increased by 13% for 2012, 10% for 2013, 8% for 2014 and 4% for 2015. Counts for 2016, 2017 and 2018 remain unchanged.\n\nOn January 16, 2019 these counts were revised to count a recipient in all locations that recipient resided in that year.\n\nOn January 1, 2019 the counts were revised to count a recipient in only one town per year even when the recipient moved within the year.

Deaths reported to the either the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) or Department of Public Health (DPH) are included in the daily COVID-19 update. \n\nData on Connecticut deaths were obtained from the Connecticut Deaths Registry maintained by the DPH Office of Vital Records. Cause of death was determined by a death certifier (e.g., physician, APRN, medical examiner) using their best clinical judgment. Additionally, all COVID-19 deaths, including suspected or related, are required to be reported to OCME. On April 4, 2020, CT DPH and OCME released a joint memo to providers and facilities within Connecticut providing guidelines for certifying deaths due to COVID-19 that were consistent with the CDC\u2019s guidelines and a reminder of the required reporting to OCME.25,26  As of July 1, 2021, OCME had reviewed every case reported and performed additional investigation on about one-third of reported deaths to better ascertain if COVID-19 did or did not cause or contribute to the death. Some of these investigations resulted in the OCME performing postmortem swabs for PCR testing on individuals whose deaths were suspected to be due to COVID-19, but antemortem diagnosis was unable to be made.31  The OCME issued or re-issued about 10% of COVID-19 death certificates and, when appropriate, removed COVID-19 from the death certificate. For standardization and tabulation of mortality statistics, written cause of death statements made by the certifiers on death certificates are sent to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the CDC which assigns cause of death codes according to the International Causes of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) classification system.25,26  COVID-19 deaths in this report are defined as those for which the death certificate has an ICD-10 code of U07.1 as either a primary (underlying) or a contributing cause of death.

{"resource": {"name": "CT School Learning Model Indicators by County (7-day metrics) - ARCHIVE", "id": "rpph-4ysy", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "DPH note about change from 7-day to 14-day metrics:\nAs of 10/15/2020, this dataset is no longer being updated. Starting on 10/15/2020, the school learning model indicator metrics will be calculated using a 14-day average rather than a 7-day average. The new school learning model indicators dataset using 14-day averages can be accessed here: https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/CT-School-Learning-Model-Indicators-by-County-14-d/e4bh-ax24\n\nAs you know, we are learning more about COVID-19 all the time, including the best ways to measure COVID-19 activity in our communities. CT DPH has decided to shift to 14-day rates because these are more stable, particularly at the town level, as compared to 7-day rates. In addition, since the school indicators were initially published by DPH last summer, CDC has recommended 14-day rates and other states (e.g., Massachusetts) have started to implement 14-day metrics for monitoring COVID transmission as well.\n\nWith respect to geography, we also have learned that many people are looking at the town-level data to inform decision making, despite emphasis on the county-level metrics in the published addenda. This is understandable as there has been variation within counties in COVID-19 activity (for example, rates that are higher in one town than in most other towns in the county).\n\nThis dataset includes the leading and secondary metrics identified by the Connecticut Department of Health (DPH) and the Department of Education (CSDE) to support local district decision-making on the level of in-person, hybrid (blended), and remote learning model for Pre K-12 education. \n\nData represent daily averages for each week by date of specimen collection (cases and positivity), date of hospital admission, or date of ED visit. Hospitalization data come from the Connecticut Hospital Association and are based on hospital location, not county of patient residence. COVID-19-like illness includes fever and cough or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing or the presence of coronavirus diagnosis code and excludes patients with influenza-like illness. All data are preliminary.\n\nThese data are updated weekly; the previous week period for each dataset is the previous Sunday-Saturday, known as an MMWR week (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/MMWR_week_overview.pdf). The date listed is the date the dataset was last updated and corresponds to a reporting period of the previous MMWR week. For instance, the data for 8/20/2020 corresponds to a reporting period of 8/9/2020-8/15/2020.\n\nThese metrics were adapted from recommendations by the Harvard Global Institute and supplemented by existing DPH measures.\n\nFor national data on COVID-19, see COVID View, the national weekly surveillance summary of U.S. COVID-19 activity, at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html\n\nNotes:\n9/25/2020: Data for Mansfield and Middletown for the week of Sept 13-19 were unavailable at the time of reporting due to delays in lab reporting.", "attribution": "Department of Public Health", "attribution_link": "https://portal.ct.gov/DPH", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-08-02T14:51:55.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-08-11T15:50:19.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-08-02T14:51:55.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2020-10-08T19:59:53.000Z", "columns_name": ["Data update date", "Reporting Period", "Percent COVID-19-like Illness Hospital ED Visits", "Percent Test Positivity", "New Hospitalizations per 100k Population per Day", "New COVID-19 Cases per 100k Population Over 7-Day Period", "County"], "columns_field_name": ["date", "reporting_period", "percent_covid_like_illness", "percent_test_positivity", "new_covid_19_hospitalizations", "new_covid_19_cases_per_100k", "county"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Date the dataset was last updated", "Reporting period", "Percent COVID-19-like illness hospital ED visits in the last week", "Percent of positive tests in the last week", "New COVID-19 hospitalizations per 100k population in the last week", "New COVID-19 cases per 100k population in the last week", "County"], "columns_format": [{"view": "date"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "percentScale": "1", "precision": "1"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "percentScale": "1", "precision": "1"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "precision": "1"}, {"precision": "1"}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-09-02T15:31:55.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["social services", "education", "housing & development"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Health and Human Services", "domain_tags": ["covid archive"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Agency_Agency", "value": "Department of Public Health"}, {"key": "Details_Geographic-Unit", "value": "County or county-equivalent"}, {"key": "Details_Update-Frequency", "value": "Not updated (historical data)"}, {"key": "Details_Temporal-Coverage", "value": "The COVID-19 Pandemic"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.ct.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.ct.gov/d/rpph-4ysy", "link": "https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/CT-School-Learning-Model-Indicators-by-County-7-da/rpph-4ysy", "owner": {"id": "dby8-627v", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Gary Archambault"}, "creator": {"id": "dby8-627v", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Gary Archambault"}}

The survey collects vaccination and exemption status data on children who entered the school system on or before a specified date during the fall semester. Individual vaccine information on each student is not collected.\n\nThis table shows the statewide vaccination exemptions (medical and religious) and percentage vaccinated and compliant for each school-entry mandated vaccine series reported by school year, grade, and school type. Percentage of students vaccinated is the number of students with the required number of doses of a given vaccine divided by the total number of students. Data for each grade includes all schools who reported with that given grade level.\n\nSchool-mandated vaccine series for students enrolled in kindergarten are inactivated polio, DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis), MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), hepatitis B, varicella and hepatitis A. Additional mandated vaccines for students enrolled in 7th grade include meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV) and Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis). Influenza vaccine is a requirement for pre-K students only, who are 24 through 59 months of age.\n\nEach child has 1 of 4 possible vaccination statutes: Vaccinated, Exempt (Religious), Exempt (Medical) or Non-compliant. The criteria shown below are used to assess whether a child is considered vaccinated.\n\n\u2022 Flu = at least 1 dose of annual influenza vaccine (pre-K only). This is a school entry requirement only for pre-K students 24 through 59 months of age.\n\u2022 Polio = at least 3 doses of inactivated polio vaccine, with the last dose on or after their 4th birthday. This is a school entry requirement starting in kindergarten.\n\u2022 DTaP = at least 4 doses of DTaP vaccine, with the last dose on or after their 4th birthday. This is a school entry requirement starting in kindergarten.\n\u2022 MMR = at least 2 doses of MMR vaccine separated by at least 28 days, with the 1st dose on or after their 1st birthday. This is a school entry requirement starting in kindergarten.\n\u2022 HepB = at least 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine, with the last dose on or after 24 weeks of age. This is a school entry requirement starting in kindergarten.\n\u2022 Varicella = at least 2 doses of varicella vaccine separated by at least 28 days, with the 1st dose on or after their 1st birthday, or a reliable history of chickenpox disease. This is a school entry requirement starting in kindergarten.\n\u2022 HepA = at least 2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine, given a minimum of six calendar months apart, with the 1st dose on or after their 1st birthday. This is a school entry requirement starting in kindergarten.

The survey collects vaccination and exemption status data on children who entered the school system on or before a specified date during the fall semester. Individual vaccine information on each student is not collected.\n\nThis table shows the percentage of seventh grade students vaccinated for each school-entry mandated vaccine series and the percentage with vaccination exemptions (medical or religious) reported by school. Percentage of students vaccinated is the number of students with the required number of doses of a given vaccine divided by the total number of students. Data includes all schools who reported students in seventh grade.\n\nSchool-mandated vaccine series for students enrolled in seventh grade are inactivated polio, DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis), MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), hepatitis B, varicella, hepatitis A, meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV) and Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis).\n\nEach child has 1 of 4 possible vaccination statutes: Vaccinated, Exempt (Religious), Exempt (Medical) or Non-compliant. The criteria shown below are used to assess whether a child is considered vaccinated.\n\n\u2022 MMR = at least 2 doses of MMR vaccine separated by at least 28 days, with the 1st dose on or after their 1st birthday. This is a school entry requirement starting in kindergarten.\n\u2022 Varicella = at least 2 doses of varicella vaccine separated by at least 28 days, with the 1st dose on or after their 1st birthday, or a reliable history of chickenpox disease. This is a school entry requirement starting in kindergarten.\n\u2022 HepA = at least 2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine, given a minimum of six calendar months apart, with the 1st dose on or after their 1st birthday. This is a school entry requirement starting in kindergarten. Starting with the 2019-2020 school year the annual survey included data collection on hepatitis A vaccine for 7th grade students.\n\u2022 MCV = at least 1 dose of meningococcal conjugate vaccine. This is a school entry requirement starting in 7th grade.\n\u2022 Tdap = at least 1 dose of Tdap vaccine. This is a school entry requirement starting in 7th grade.\n\u2022 All = Percentage of students with all above vaccine series required for that grade level.\n\nChildren without a record of vaccination, but with serologic proof of immunity to certain diseases (measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, hepatitis A, and varicella), meet school entry requirements and may be counted as vaccinated.\n\nThe values for schools with fewer than 30 enrolled seventh graders are suppressed, and those fields are left blank.\n\nData Limitations and Considerations:\n\u2022 The school level data shown here are as tabulated and reported by schools and discrepancies may exist.\n\u2022 The Immunization Program identifies outliers and internally inconsistent data points and works with schools to resolve any data quality issues, when possible.\n\u2022 CT DPH cannot verify the accuracy of vaccine data for individual children or whether the documentation necessary to claim an exemption has been submitted.\n\u2022 Data are collected at the beginning of the school year, by which time vaccines are due. As the year progresses, immunization rates may increase as additional children receive required immunizations. Additionally, the student body is dynamic and as students arrive and leave school, the immunization rates are impacted.\n\u2022 Vaccine status is assessed on the level of the child and not on each vaccine. Once a child is listed as exempt, vaccination data is no longer collected in the survey for that child.

Starting on 10/15/2020, these metrics will be calculated using a 14-day average rather than a 7-day average. The new dataset using 14-day averages can be accessed here: https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-case-rate-per-100-000-population-and-perc/hree-nys2\n\nAs you know, we are learning more about COVID-19 all the time, including the best ways to measure COVID-19 activity in our communities. CT DPH has decided to shift to 14-day rates because these are more stable, particularly at the town level, as compared to 7-day rates. In addition, since the school indicators were initially published by DPH last summer, CDC has recommended 14-day rates and other states (e.g., Massachusetts) have started to implement 14-day metrics for monitoring COVID transmission as well.\n\nWith respect to geography, we also have learned that many people are looking at the town-level data to inform decision making, despite emphasis on the county-level metrics in the published addenda. This is understandable as there has been variation within counties in COVID-19 activity (for example, rates that are higher in one town than in most other towns in the county).\n\nThis dataset includes a weekly count and weekly rate per 100,000 population for COVID-19 cases, a weekly count of COVID-19 PCR diagnostic tests, and a weekly percent positivity rate for tests among people living in community settings. Dates are based on date of specimen collection (cases and positivity).\n\nA person is considered a new case only upon their first COVID-19 testing result because a case is defined as an instance or bout of illness. If they are tested again subsequently and are still positive, it still counts toward the test positivity metric but they are not considered another case. \n\nThese case and test counts do not include cases or tests among people residing in congregate settings, such as nursing homes, assisted living facilities, or correctional facilities. \n\nThese data are updated weekly; the previous week period for each dataset is the previous Sunday-Saturday, known as an MMWR week (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/MMWR_week_overview.pdf). The date listed is the date the dataset was last updated and corresponds to a reporting period of the previous MMWR week.

Due to eligibility policies and operational processes, enrollment can vary slightly after publication. Please be aware of the point-in-time nature of the published data when comparing to other data published or shared by the Department of Social Services, as this data may vary slightly.\n\nAs a general practice, for monthly data sets published on the Open Data Portal, DSS will continue to refresh the monthly enrollment data for three months, after which time it will remain static. For example, when March data is published the data in January and February will be refreshed. When April data is published, February and March data will be refreshed, but January will not change. This allows the Department to account for the most common enrollment variations in published data while also ensuring that data remains as stable as possible over time. In the event of a significant change in enrollment data, the Department may republish reports and will notate such republication dates and reasons accordingly.\nIn March 2020, Connecticut opted to add a new Medicaid coverage group: the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured. Enrollment data on this limited-benefit Medicaid coverage group is being incorporated into Medicaid data effective January 1, 2021. Enrollment data for this coverage group prior to January 1, 2021, was listed under State Funded Medical. Effective January 1, 2021, this coverage group have been separated: (1) the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured is now G06-I and is now listed as a limited benefit plan that rolls up into \u201cProgram Name\u201d of Medicaid and \u201cMedical Benefit Plan\u201d of HUSKY Limited Benefit; (2) the emergency medical coverage has been separated into G06-II as a limited benefit plan that rolls up into \u201cProgram Name\u201d of Emergency Medical and \u201cMedical Benefit Plan\u201d of Other Medical. An historical accounting of enrollment of the specific coverage group starting in calendar year 2020 will also be published separately.\nThis data represents number of active recipients who received benefits under a program in that calendar year and month. A recipient may have received benefits from multiple programs in the same month; if so that recipient will be included in multiple categories in this dataset (counted more than once.)\n2021 is a partial year.\nFor privacy considerations, a count of zero is used for counts less than five.\nNOTE: On April 22, 2019 the methodology for determining HUSKY A Newborn recipients changed, which caused an increase of recipients for that benefit starting in October 2016. We now count recipients recorded in the ImpaCT system as well as in the HIX system for that assistance type, instead using HIX exclusively.\nAlso, corrections in the ImpaCT system for January and February 2019 caused the addition of around 2000 and 3000 recipients respectively, and the counts for many types of assistance (e.g. SNAP) were adjusted upward for those 2 months.\nAlso, the methodology for determining the address of the recipients changed:\n    1. The address of a recipient in the ImpaCT system is now correctly determined specific to that month instead of using the address of the most recent month. This resulted in some shuffling of the recipients among townships starting in October 2016.\n    2. If, in a given month, a recipient has benefit records in both the HIX system and in the ImpaCT system, the address of the recipient is now calculated as follows to resolve conflicts: Use the residential address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the mailing address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the address in HIX. This resulted in a reduction in counts for most townships starting in March 2017 because a single address is now used instead of two when the systems do not agree.\nNOTE: On February 14 2019, the enrollment counts for", "attribution": "Department of Social Services", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-01-11T20:58:10.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-09-12T22:50:17.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-01-11T20:58:09.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-01-11T20:58:10.000Z", "columns_name": ["program", "year_month", "active_recipients"], "columns_field_name": ["program", "year_month", "active_recipients"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-09-12T22:52:17.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["finance", "public safety", "economy"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Health and Human Services", "domain_tags": ["department of social services", "dss", "dss enrollment counts", "enrollment counts", "monthly", "program"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Agency_Agency", "value": "Department of Social Services"}, {"key": "Details_Geographic-Unit", "value": "State"}, {"key": "Details_Update-Frequency", "value": "Monthly"}, {"key": "Details_Temporal-Coverage", "value": "2012-2023"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.ct.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.ct.gov/d/sx77-vjbh", "link": "https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/DSS-Program-Participation-by-Month-CY-2012-2023/sx77-vjbh", "owner": {"id": "fdda-4dst", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Vijay Subramaniam"}, "creator": {"id": "fdda-4dst", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Vijay Subramaniam"}}

Enrollment data on this limited-benefit Medicaid coverage group is being incorporated into Medicaid data effective January 1, 2021. \n\nEnrollment data for this coverage group prior to January 1, 2021, was listed under State Funded Medical. An historical accounting of enrollment of the specific coverage group starting in calendar year 2020 will also be published separately.\n\n<b>2018</b>\nOn April 22, 2019 the methodology for determining HUSKY A Newborn recipients changed, which caused an increase of recipients for that benefit starting in October 2016. We now count recipients recorded in the ImpaCT system as well as in the HIX system for that assistance type, instead using HIX exclusively.\n\nAlso, the methodology for determining the address of the recipients changed:\n1. The address of a recipient in the ImpaCT system is now correctly determined specific to that month instead of using the address of the most recent month. This resulted in some shuffling of the recipients among townships starting in October 2016.\n\n2. If, in a given month, a recipient has benefit records in both the HIX system and in the ImpaCT system, the address of the recipient is now calculated as follows to resolve conflicts: Use the residential address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the mailing address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the address in HIX. This resulted in a reduction in counts for most townships starting in March 2017 because a single address is now used instead of two when the systems do not agree.\n\nOn February 14, 2019 the enrollment counts for 2012-2015 across all programs were updated to account for an error in the data integration process. As a result, the count of the number of people served increased by 13% for 2012, 10% for 2013, 8% for 2014 and 4% for 2015. Counts for 2016, 2017 and 2018 remain unchanged.\n\nOn January 16, 2019 these counts were revised to count a recipient in all locations that recipient resided in that year.\n\nOn January 1, 2019 the counts were revised to count a recipient in only one town per year even when the recipient moved within the year.

People with an out-of-state zip code are excluded from this analysis.  \n\nAll data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. \n\nA person who has received at least one dose of any COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have initiated vaccination. A person is considered fully vaccinated if they have completed a primary vaccine series by receiving 2 doses of the Pfizer, Novavax or Moderna vaccines or 1 dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The fully vaccinated are a subset of the number who have received at least one dose.    \n\nA person who completed a Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax or Johnson & Johnson primary series (as defined above) and then had an additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have had additional dose 1. The additional monovalent dose may be Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax or Johnson & Johnson and may be a different type from the primary series. For people who had a primary Pfizer or Moderna series, additional dose 1 was counted starting August 18th, 2021. For people with a Johnson & Johnson primary series additional dose 1 was counted starting October 22nd, 2021. For most people, additional dose 1 is a booster. However, additional dose 1 may represent a supplement to the primary series for a people who is moderately or severely immunosuppressed. Bivalent booster administrations are not included in the additional dose 1 calculations.\n\n SVI refers to the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index - a measure that combines 15 demographic variables to identify communities most vulnerable to negative health impacts from disasters and public health crises. Measures of social vulnerability include socioeconomic status, household composition, disability, race, ethnicity, language, and transportation limitations - among others.  SVI scores were calculated for each zip code in CT.  The zip codes in the top 20% were designated as SVI Priority Zip Codes. Percentages are based on 2018 zip code population data supplied by ESRI corporation.    \n\nThe percent with at least one dose many be over-estimated and the percent fully vaccinated and with additional dose 1 may be under-estimated because of vaccine administration records for individuals that cannot be linked because of differences in how names or date of birth are reported.  \n\nConnecticut COVID-19 Vaccine Program providers are required to report information on all COVID-19 vaccine doses administered to CT WiZ, the Connecticut Immunization Information System.

Under the terms of the program, the governor of each state must submit a plan to the federal government designating up to 25 percent of the qualified census tracts in their state as opportunity zones, which is then subject to approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.", "attribution": "Office of Policy and Management", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-08-09T13:54:56.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-07-31T15:37:50.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-08-09T13:54:56.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-07-31T17:19:28.000Z", "columns_name": ["name10", "intptlat10", "funcstat10", "countyfp10", "aland10", "intptlon10", "namelsad10", "mtfcc10", "awater10", "geoid10", "tractce10", "geoid_aff2", "town", "statefp10", "the_geom"], "columns_field_name": ["name10", "intptlat10", "funcstat10", "countyfp10", "aland10", "intptlon10", "namelsad10", "mtfcc10", "awater10", "geoid10", "tractce10", "geoid_aff2", "town", "statefp10", "the_geom"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "MultiPolygon"], "columns_description": ["name10", "intptlat10", "funcstat10", "countyfp10", "aland10", "intptlon10", "namelsad10", "mtfcc10", "awater10", "geoid10", "tractce10", "geoid_aff2", "town", "statefp10", "the_geom"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-07-31T17:19:28.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["economy", "infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Housing and Development", "domain_tags": ["opportunity zones"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Agency_Agency", "value": "Office of Policy and Management"}, {"key": "Details_Geographic-Unit", "value": "Census tract"}, {"key": "Details_Update-Frequency", "value": "As needed"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.ct.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.ct.gov/d/tzsr-ib7k", "link": "https://data.ct.gov/Housing-and-Development/Opportunity-Zones/tzsr-ib7k", "owner": {"id": "rfiw-8538", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Pauline Zaldonis"}, "creator": {"id": "rfiw-8538", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Pauline Zaldonis"}}

Specifically, HUD relies on the most recent three sets of ACS data to ensure that anomalous estimates, due to sampling, do not affect the QCT status of tracts. \n\u00a0\nQCTs are identified for the purpose of Low-Income Housing Credits under IRC Section 42, with the purpose of increasing the availability of low-income rental housing by providing an income tax credit to certain owners of newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated low-income rental housing projects.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nAlso included are the number of households from the 2010 census (the \u201cp0150001\u201d variable), the average poverty rate using the 2014-2018 ACS data (the \u201cpov_rate_18\u201d variable), and the ratio of Tract Average Household Size Adjusted Income Limit to Tract Median Household Income using the 2014-2018 ACS data (the \u201cinc_factor_18\u201d variable). \nFor the last variable mentioned in the previous paragraph, the income limit is the limit for being considered a very low income household (size-adjusted and based on Area Mean Gross Income). This value is divided by the median household income for the given tract, to get a sense of how the limit and median incomes compare. For example, if ratio>1, it implies that the tract is very low income because the limit income is greater than the median income. This ratio is a compact way to include the separate variables for the household income limit and median household income for each tract.", "attribution": "U.S. Department of Housing and Urban

{"resource": {"name": "DSS Medical Benefit Plan Participation CY 2012-2022", "id": "vcsk-xwsy", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "In order to facilitate public review and access, enrollment data published on the Open Data Portal is provided as promptly as possible after the end of each month or year, as applicable to the data set. Due to eligibility policies and operational processes, enrollment can vary slightly after publication. Please be aware of the point-in-time nature of the published data when comparing to other data published or shared by the Department of Social Services, as this data may vary slightly.\n\nAs a general practice, for monthly data sets published on the Open Data Portal, DSS will continue to refresh the monthly enrollment data for three months, after which time it will remain static. For example, when March data is published the data in January and February will be refreshed. When April data is published, February and March data will be refreshed, but January will not change. This allows the Department to account for the most common enrollment variations in published data while also ensuring that data remains as stable as possible over time. In the event of a significant change in enrollment data, the Department may republish reports and will notate such republication dates and reasons accordingly.\nIn March 2020, Connecticut opted to add a new Medicaid coverage group: the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured. Enrollment data on this limited-benefit Medicaid coverage group is being incorporated into Medicaid data effective January 1, 2021. Enrollment data for this coverage group prior to January 1, 2021, was listed under State Funded Medical. An historical accounting of enrollment of the specific coverage group starting in calendar year 2020 will also be published separately.\nThe data represents number of active recipients who received benefits under a medical benefit plan in that calendar year. A recipient may have received benefits from multiple plans in the same year; if so that recipient will be included in multiple categories in this dataset (counted more than once.)\nFor privacy considerations, a count of zero is used for counts less than five.\nNOTE: On April 22, 2019 the methodology for determining HUSKY A Newborn recipients changed, which caused an increase of recipients for that benefit starting in October 2016. We now count recipients recorded in the ImpaCT system as well as in the HIX system for that assistance type, instead using HIX exclusively.\nAlso, the methodology for determining the address of the recipients changed:\n    1. The address of a recipient in the ImpaCT system is now correctly determined specific to that month instead of using the address of the most recent month. This resulted in some shuffling of the recipients among townships starting in October 2016.\n    2. If, in a given month, a recipient has benefit records in both the HIX system and in the ImpaCT system, the address of the recipient is now calculated as follows to resolve conflicts: Use the residential address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the mailing address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the address in HIX. This resulted in a reduction in counts for most townships starting in March 2017 because a single address is now used instead of two when the systems do not agree.\nNOTE: On February 14 2019, the enrollment counts for 2012-2015 across all programs were updated to account for an error in the data integration process. As a result, the count of the number of people served increased by 13% for 2012, 10% for 2013, 8% for 2014 and 4% for 2015. Counts for 2016, 2017 and 2018 remain unchanged.\nNOTE: On 11/30/2018 the counts were revised because of a change in the way active recipients were counted in one source system.", "attribution": "Department of Social Services", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-09-18T19:45:37.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-09-12T19:01:25.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-09-18T19:45:37.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-04-11T17:50:40.000Z", "columns_name": ["active_recipients", "year", "medical_benefit_plan"], "columns_field_name": ["active_recipients", "year", "medical_benefit_plan"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-09-12T19:02:43.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["finance", "public safety"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Health and Human Services", "domain_tags": ["department of social services", "dss", "dss enrollment counts", "enrollment counts", "medical benefit plan"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Agency_Agency", "value": "Department of Social Services"}, {"key": "Details_Geographic-Unit", "value": "State"}, {"key": "Details_Update-Frequency", "value": "Annually"}, {"key": "Details_Temporal-Coverage", "value": "2012-2022"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.ct.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.ct.gov/d/vcsk-xwsy", "link": "https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/DSS-Medical-Benefit-Plan-Participation-CY-2012-202/vcsk-xwsy", "owner": {"id": "fdda-4dst", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Vijay Subramaniam"}, "creator": {"id": "fdda-4dst", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Vijay Subramaniam"}}

View the full dataset and detailed metadata here: https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/anag-cw7u\n\nThe following dataset provides facility-level data for hospital utilization aggregated on a weekly basis (Friday to Thursday). These are derived from reports with facility-level granularity across two main sources: (1) HHS TeleTracking, and (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities.\n\nThe hospital population includes all hospitals registered with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as of June 1, 2020. It includes non-CMS hospitals that have reported since July 15, 2020. It does not include psychiatric, rehabilitation, Indian Health Service (IHS) facilities, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities, Defense Health Agency (DHA) facilities, and religious non-medical facilities.\n\nFor a given entry, the term \u201ccollection_week\u201d signifies the start of the period that is aggregated. For example, a \u201ccollection_week\u201d of 2020-11-20 means the average/sum/coverage of the elements captured from that given facility starting and including Friday, November 20, 2020, and ending and including reports for Thursday, November 26, 2020.\n\nReported elements include an append of either \u201c_coverage\u201d, \u201c_sum\u201d, or \u201c_avg\u201d.\n\nA \u201c_coverage\u201d append denotes how many times the facility reported that element during that collection week.\n\nA \u201c_sum\u201d append denotes the sum of the reports provided for that facility for that element during that collection week.\n\nA \u201c_avg\u201d append is the average of the reports provided for that facility for that element during that collection week.\n\nThe file will be updated weekly. No statistical analysis is applied to impute non-response. For averages, calculations are based on the number of values collected for a given hospital in that collection week. Suppression is applied to the file for sums and averages less than four (4). In these cases, the field will be replaced with \u201c-999,999\u201d.\n\nThis data is preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. Data is available starting on July 31, 2020.\n\nSometimes, reports for a given facility will be provided to both HHS TeleTracking and HHS Protect. When this occurs, to ensure that there are not duplicate reports, deduplication is applied according to prioritization rules within HHS Protect.\n\nFor influenza fields listed in the file, the current HHS guidance marks these fields as optional. As a result, coverage of these elements are varied.\n\nOn May 3, 2021, the following fields have been added to this data set.\nhhs_ids\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed_7_day_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_pediatric_covid_confirmed_7_day_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected_7_day_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_pediatric_covid_suspected_7_day_coverage\nprevious_week_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_administered_7_day_sum\ntotal_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_none_7_day_sum\ntotal_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_one_7_day_sum\ntotal_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_all_7_day_sum\nprevious_week_patients_covid_vaccinated_doses_one_7_day_sum\nprevious_week_patients_covid_vaccinated_doses_all_7_day_sum\n\n\nOn May 8, 2021, this data set has been converted to a corrected data set. The corrections applied to this data set are to smooth out data anomalies caused by keyed in data errors. To help determine which records have had corrections made to it. An additional Boolean field called is_corrected has been added.

To view the full dataset and filter the data, click the \"View Data\" button at the top right of the screen. More data on people served by DSS can be found <a href=\"https://data.ct.gov/browse?tags=dss%20enrollment%20counts\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n\n<b>About this data</b>\n  <li>For privacy considerations, a count of zero is used for counts less than five.</li>\n  <li>A recipient is counted in all towns where that recipient resided in that year.</li>\n  <li>Due to eligibility policies and operational processes, enrollment can vary slightly after publication. Please be aware of the point-in-time nature of the published data when comparing to other data published or shared by the Department of Social Services, as this data may vary slightly.</li>\n\n<b>Notes by year</b>\n<b>2021</b>\nIn March 2020, Connecticut opted to add a new Medicaid coverage group: the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured. Enrollment data on this limited-benefit Medicaid coverage group is being incorporated into Medicaid data effective January 1, 2021. \n\nEnrollment data for this coverage group prior to January 1, 2021, was listed under State Funded Medical. An historical accounting of enrollment of the specific coverage group starting in calendar year 2020 will also be published separately.\n\n<b>2018</b>\nOn April 22, 2019 the methodology for determining HUSKY A Newborn recipients changed, which caused an increase of recipients for that benefit starting in October 2016. We now count recipients recorded in the ImpaCT system as well as in the HIX system for that assistance type, instead using HIX exclusively.\n\nAlso, the methodology for determining the address of the recipients changed:\n1. The address of a recipient in the ImpaCT system is now correctly determined specific to that month instead of using the address of the most recent month. This resulted in some shuffling of the recipients among townships starting in October 2016.\n\n2. If, in a given month, a recipient has benefit records in both the HIX system and in the ImpaCT system, the address of the recipient is now calculated as follows to resolve conflicts: Use the residential address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the mailing address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the address in HIX. This resulted in a reduction in counts for most townships starting in March 2017 because a single address is now used instead of two when the systems do not agree.\n\nOn February 14, 2019 the enrollment counts for 2012-2015 across all programs were updated to account for an error in the data integration process. As a result, the count of the number of people served increased by 13% for 2012, 10% for 2013, 8% for 2014 and 4% for 2015. Counts for 2016, 2017 and 2018 remain unchanged.\n\nOn January 16, 2019 these counts were revised to count a recipient in all locations that recipient resided in that year.\n\nOn January 1, 2019 the counts were revised to count a recipient in only one town per year even when the recipient moved within the year.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Vaccination by Town and Race/Ethnicity - ARCHIVED", "id": "wmiq-er83", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "NOTE: As of 2/16/2023, this page is no longer being updated.\n\nThis table shows the number and percent of people that have initiated COVID-19 vaccination and are fully vaccinated by race / ethnicity and town.   It includes people of all ages.   \n\nAll data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. \n\nA person who has received at least one dose of any vaccine is considered to have initiated vaccination. A person is considered fully vaccinated if they have completed a primary series by receiving 2 doses of the Pfizer, Novavax or Moderna vaccines or 1 dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The fully vaccinated are a subset of the number who have received at least one dose.  \n\nRace and ethnicity data may be self-reported or taken from an existing electronic health care record.   Reported race and ethnicity information is used to create a single race/ethnicity variable. People with Hispanic ethnicity are classified as Hispanic regardless of reported race.  People with a missing ethnicity are classified as non-Hispanic. People with more than one race are classified as multiple race. \n\nA vaccine coverage percentage cannot be calculated for people classified as NH Other race or NH Unknown race since there are not population size estimates for these groups. Data quality assurance activities suggest that NH Other may represent a missing value. Vaccine coverage estimates in specific race/ethnicity groups may be underestimated as result of the exclusion of records classified as NH Unknown Race or NH Other Race.   \n\nTown of residence is verified by geocoding the reported address and then mapping it a town using municipal boundaries.  If an address cannot be geocoded, the reported town is used. \nTown-level coverage estimates have been capped at 100%.  Observed coverage may be greater than 100% for multiple reasons, including census denominator data not including all individuals that currently reside in the town (e.g., part time residents, change in population size since the census) or potential data reporting errors.\nThe population denominators for these town- and age-specific coverage estimates are based on 2014 census estimates. This is the most recent year for which reliable town- and age-specific estimates are available. (https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Health-Information-Systems--Reporting/Population/Town-Population-with-Demographics).  Changes in the size and composition of the population between 2014 and 2021 may results in inaccuracy in vaccine coverage estimates.  For example, the size of the Hispanic population may be underestimated in a town given the reported increase in the size of the Hispanic population between the 2010 and 2020 censuses resulting in inflated vaccine coverage estimates. \n\nThe 2014 census data are grouped in 5-year age bands. For vaccine coverage age groupings not consistent with a standard 5-year age band, each age was assumed to be 20% of the total within a 5-year age band. However, given the large deviation from this assumption for Mansfield because of the presence of the University of Connecticut, the age distribution observed in the 2010 census for the age bands 15 to 19 and 20 to 24 was used to estimate the population denominators.  \n\nThis table does not included doses administered to CT residents by out-of-state providers or by some Federal entities (including Department of Defense, Department of Correction, Department of Veteran\u2019s Affairs, Indian Health Service) because they are not yet reported to CT WiZ (the CT immunization Information System).  It is expected that these data will be added in the future. \n\nCaution should be used when interpreting coverage estimates for towns with large college/university populations since coverage may be underestimated. In the census, college/university students who live on or just off campus would be counted in the college/university town.

For information related to releases reported to CT DEEP from July 1, 2022 to the present, go to  Incident Reports for Releases Reported to CT DEEP July 1, 2022 to present at: https://connecticut.hazconnect.com/listincidentpublic.aspx\n\nFor a dataset related to releases reported to CT DEEP from July 1, 2022 to recent refer to the CT Open Data dataset:  https://data.ct.gov/Environment-and-Natural-Resources/Spill-Incidents-from-July-1-2022-to-Recent-for-Dow/ffju-s5c5\n\nConnecticut General Statutes Section 22a-450 requires anyone who causes any discharge, spillage, uncontrolled loss, seepage or filtration of oil or petroleum or chemical liquids or solid, liquid or gaseous products, or hazardous wastes which poses a potential threat to human health or the environment to report that release to the CT DEEP.  Reports of releases from other persons are also included in this dataset.\n\nExamples of what may be included in a spill incident record includes: Administrative information (unique spill case number). Spill date/time. Location. Spill source and cause. Material(s) and material type spilled. Quantity spilled. Measurement units. Surface water bodies affected. \n\nData limitations and factors to consider when using this data: \nThis data is limited to information about a spill incident as it was known at the time it was reported to CT DEEP. Although some data reflects updated information after the time of the initial notification, CT DEEP is unable to field check and verify all reported information.  Therefore, information later determined to be incomplete or inaccurate may exist in this data set.  There may also be spelling errors or other unintentionally inaccurate data that was transcribed in the spill incident report.\n\nThis dataset is a subset of records and information that may be available about releases that have occurred at specific locations.  This dataset does not replace a full review of files publicly available either on-line and/or at CT DEEP\u2019s Records Center. \n\nFor a complete review of agency records for this or other agency programs, you can perform your own search in our DEEP public file room located at 79 Elm Street, Hartford CT or at our DEEP Online Search Portal at:  https://filings.deep.ct.gov/DEEPDocumentSearchPortal/Home .\n\nIf errors are found or there are questions about the data, please contact the program unit using the following email address: DEEP.SpillsDocs@ct.gov", "attribution": "Department of Energy & Environmental Protection, Emergency Response and Spill Prevention Division", "attribution_link": "https://portal.ct.gov/DEEP/Emergency-Response-and-Spill-Prevention/Overview---Emergency-Response-and-Spill-Prevention-Division", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-01-08T19:21:05.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-12-18T21:24:22.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-01-08T19:16:55.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-01-08T19:21:05.000Z", "columns_name": ["Release Type", "Location Of Reported Release", "Media Info", "Cause Info", "Corrective Actions Taken", "Waterbodies Affected", "Type of Waterbody Affected", "Emergency Measures", "Total Quantity Pounds", "Total Quantity Drums", "Total Quantity Feet", "Total Quantity Yards", "Total Quantity Gallons", "Release Substance", "Responsible Party Accepts Responsibility (Y/N)", "Responsible Party Zip", "Responsible Party State", "Responsible Party Town", "Responsible Party Address", "Responsibile Party/Discharger", "Representing", "Reported By", "Status", "State of Release", "Town of Release", "Release date and time", "Date Reported Time Reported", "Assigned to", "Case No.", "Year"], "columns_field_name": ["releasetype", "location", "mediainfo", "causeinfo", "actions", "waterbodiesaffected", "waterbody", "emergencymeasures", "quanlbs", "quandrums", "quanfeet", "quanyards", "quangallons", "releasesubstance", "responsibility", "repzip", "repstate", "reptown", "repstreet", "discharger", "representing", "reportedby", "status", "stateofrelease", "townrelease", "releasedatetime", "date_reported_time_reported", "assignedto", "caseno", "year"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Checkbox", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["The categories of the reported substance(s) released:  petroleum, chemical, dialect,  hazardous waste, sewage related, biomedical, gas emission, other, or not specified.", "Any known address or geographic information associated with the location of the incident as it was reported. -- this may or may not be the originating location of the release", "The environmental media or setting affected by the release", "Cause of incident, if known", "Response actions taken to address the release, if known at the time of the incident\u2019s report to CT DEEP  ", "Waterbody name(s) if known or expected to be affected", "If known, the type of waterbody affected, such as a lake, stream, catch basins", "Additional information regarding the incident ", "Amount in Pounds of substance spilled or found -- \u201c0\u201d indicates indicates zero or can indicate an unknown amount.

Nursing homes were asked to provide cumulative totals of residents with laboratory confirmed covid. This includes residents currently in-house, in the hospital, or who are deceased. Residents were excluded if they tested positive prior to initial admission to the nursing home. \n2) The cumulative number of deaths among nursing home residents is based upon data reported by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. For public health surveillance, COVID-19-associated deaths include persons who tested positive for COVID-19 around the time of death (laboratory-confirmed) and persons whose death certificate lists COVID-19 disease as a cause of death or a significant condition contributing to death (probable).\n \nLimitations:\n1) As of the week of 5/10/20, Point Prevalence Survey testing is being offered to all asymptomatic nursing home residents to inform infection prevention efforts. Point prevalence surveys will be conducted over a period of several weeks. Some nursing homes had adequate testing resources available to conduct surveys prior to this date. Differences in survey timing will impact the number of positive results that a nursing home reports.\n2) Cumulative totals of residents testing positive are being collected rather than individual resident data. Thus we cannot verify the counts, de-duplicate, and/or verify whether there is a record of a positive lab test. This may result in either under- or over-counting.\n3) The number of COVID-19 positive residents and the number of confirmed deaths among residents are tabulated from different data sources. Due to the timing of availability of test results for deceased residents, it is not appropriate to calculate the percent of cases who died due to COVID-19 at any particular facility based upon this data.\n4) The count of deaths reported for 4/14 are not included in this dataset, as they were not broken out by laboratory-confirmed or probable.

The metadata enables searches by:  Site Town, Site Address, Generator Name, Generator ID Number, Manifest ID Number and Date of Shipment.\n\u2022 All of the metadata and scanned images are available electronically via DEEP\u2019s Document Online Search Portal at:  https://filings.deep.ct.gov/DEEPDocumentSearchPortal/\n\u2022 Therefore, it is no longer necessary to visit the DEEP Records Center in Hartford for manifest records or information.\n\u2022 This CT Data dataset \u201cHazardous Waste Portal Manifest Metadata\u201d (or \u201cPortal Manifest Metadata\u201d) was copied from the DEEP Document Online Search Portal, and includes only the metadata \u2013 no images.\n\nWHY USE THE CONNECTICUT OPEN DATA PORTAL MANIFEST METADATA DATASET INSTEAD OF THE DEEP DOCUMENT ONLINE SEARCH PORTAL ITSELF?\nThe Portal Manifest Metadata is a good search tool to use along with the Portal.  Searching the Portal Manifest Metadata can provide the following advantages over searching the Portal: \n\u2022 faster searches, especially for \u201clarge searches\u201d - those with a large number of search returns unlimited number of search returns (Portal is limited to 500);\n\u2022 larger display of search returns;\n\u2022 search returns can be sorted and filtered online in CT Data; and\n\u2022 search returns and the entire dataset can be downloaded from CT Data and used offline (e.g. download to Excel format)\n\u2022 metadata from searches can be copied from CT Data and pasted into the Portal search fields to quickly find single scanned images. \nThe main advantages of the Portal are:\n\u2022 it provides access to scanned images of manifest documents (CT Data does not); and\n\u2022 images can be downloaded one or multiple at a time. \n\nWHAT MANIFESTS ARE INCLUDED IN DEEP\u2019S MANIFEST PERMANENT RECORDS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE VIA THE DEEP DOCUMENT SEARCH PORTAL AND CT OPEN DATA?\nAll hazardous waste manifest records received and maintained by the DEEP Manifest Program; including:\n\u2022 manifests originating from a Connecticut Generator or sent to a Connecticut Destination Facility including manifests accompanying an exported shipment\n\u2022 manifests with RCRA hazardous waste listed on them (such manifests may also have non-RCRA hazardous waste listed)\n\u2022 manifests from a Generator with a Connecticut Generator ID number (permanent or temporary number)\n\u2022 manifests with sufficient quantities of RCRA hazardous waste listed for DEEP to consider the Generator to be a Small or Large Quantity Generator\n\u2022 manifests with PCBs listed on them from 2016 to 6-29-2018.\n\u2022 Note: manifests sent to a CT Destination Facility were indexed by the Connecticut or Out of State Generator.  Searches by CT Designated Facility are not possible unless such facility is the Generator for the purposes of manifesting. \n\nAll other manifests were considered \u201cnon-hazardous\u201d manifests and not scanned.  They were discarded after 2 years in accord with DEEP records retention schedule.

For data on COVID-19 updated (bivalent) booster coverage by town please to go to https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-Updated-Bivalent-Booster-Coverage-By-Town/bqd5-4jgh.\n\nThis table shows the number and percent of residents of each CT town that have initiated COVID-19 vaccination, are fully vaccinated and who have received additional dose 1.  \n\nAll data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. \n\nIn the data shown here, a person who has received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have initiated vaccination. A person is considered fully vaccinated if he/she has completed a primary vaccination series by receiving 2 doses of the Pfizer, Novavax or Moderna vaccines or 1 dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The fully vaccinated are a subset of the people who have received at least one dose.\n \nA person who completed a Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax or Johnson & Johnson primary series (as defined above) and then had an additional monovalent dose of COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have had  additional dose 1. The additional dose may be Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax or Johnson & Johnson and may be a different type from the primary series.  For people who had a primary Pfizer or Moderna series, additional dose 1 was counted starting August 18th, 2021. For people with a Johnson & Johnson primary series additional dose 1 was counted starting October 22nd, 2021. For most people, additional dose 1 is a booster. However, additional dose 1 may represent a supplement to the primary series for a people who is moderately or severely immunosuppressed. Bivalent booster administrations are not included in the additional dose 1 calculations.\n\nThe percent with at least one dose many be over-estimated, and the percent fully vaccinated and with additional dose 1 may be under-estimated because of vaccine administration records for individuals that cannot be linked because of differences in how names or date of birth are reported. \n\nPercentages are calculated using 2019 census data (https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Health-Information-Systems--Reporting/Population/Annual-Town-and-County-Population-for-Connecticut).  \n\nTown of residence is verified by geocoding the reported address and then mapping it to a town using municipal boundaries.  If an address cannot be geocoded, the reported town is used, if available. People for whom an address is not currently available are shown in this table as \u201cAddress pending validation\u201d. Out-of-state residents vaccinated by CT providers are excluded from the table.     \n\nTown-level coverage estimates have been capped at 100%.  Observed coverage may be greater than 100% for multiple reasons, including census denominator data not including all individuals that currently reside in the town (e.g., part time residents, change in population size since the census), errors in address data or other reporting errors.  Also, the percent with at least one dose many be over-estimated, and the percent fully vaccinated and with additional dose 1 may be under-estimated when records for an individual cannot be linked because of differences in how names or date of birth are reported.  \n\nCaution should be used when interpreting coverage estimates for towns with large college/university populations since coverage may be underestimated. In the census, college/university students who live on or just off campus would be counted in the college/university town. However, if a student was vaccinated while studying remotely in his/her hometown, the student may be counted as a vaccine recipient in that town.  \n\nSVI refers to the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index - a measure that combines 15 demographic variables to identify communities most vulnerable to negative health impacts from disasters and public health crises.

The fully vaccinated are a subset of the number who have received at least one dose. The number with At Least One Dose and the number Fully Vaccinated add up to more than the total number of doses because people who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine fit into both categories.\n\nIn this data, a person with reported Hispanic or Latino ethnicity is considered Hispanic regardless of reported race.

As of 6/27/2022, the data will be published in four tables instead of twelve.\n\nThe COVID-19 Cases, Deaths, and Tests by Day dataset contains cases and test data by date of sample submission.  The death data are by date of death.  This dataset is updated daily and contains information back to the beginning of the pandemic.  The data can be found at https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-Cases-Deaths-and-Tests-by-Day/g9vi-2ahj.\n\nThe COVID-19 State Metrics dataset contains over 93 columns of data.  This dataset is updated daily and currently contains information starting June 21, 2022 to the present.  The data can be found at https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-State-Level-Data/qmgw-5kp6 .\n\nThe COVID-19 County Metrics dataset contains 25 columns of data.  This dataset is updated daily and currently contains information starting June 16, 2022 to the present.  The data can be found at https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-County-Level-Data/ujiq-dy22 .\n\nThe COVID-19 Town Metrics dataset contains 16 columns of data.  This dataset is updated daily and currently contains information starting June 16, 2022 to the present.  The data can be found at https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-Town-Level-Data/icxw-cada .   To protect confidentiality, if a town has fewer than 5 cases or positive NAAT tests over the past 7 days, those data will be suppressed.\n\nCOVID-19 cases and associated deaths that have been reported among Connecticut residents, broken out by age group. All data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. Deaths reported to the either the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) or Department of Public Health (DPH) are included in the daily COVID-19 update. \n\nData are reported daily, with timestamps indicated in the daily briefings posted at: portal.ct.gov/coronavirus. Data are subject to future revision as reporting changes.\n\nStarting in July 2020, this dataset will be updated every weekday. \n\nAdditional notes:\nA delay in the data pull schedule occurred on 06/23/2020. Data from 06/22/2020 was processed on 06/23/2020 at 3:30 PM. The normal data cycle resumed with the data for 06/23/2020.\n\nA network outage on 05/19/2020 resulted in a change in the data pull schedule. Data from 5/19/2020 was processed on 05/20/2020 at 12:00 PM. Data from 5/20/2020 was processed on 5/20/2020 8:30 PM. The normal data cycle resumed on 05/20/2020 with the 8:30 PM data pull. As a result of the network outage, the timestamp on the datasets on the Open Data Portal differ from the timestamp in DPH's daily PDF reports.\n\nStarting 5/10/2021, the date field will represent the date this data was updated on data.ct.gov. Previously the date the data was pulled by DPH was listed, which typically coincided with the date before the data was published on data.ct.gov.
