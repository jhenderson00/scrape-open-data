All data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. Deaths reported to the either the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) or Department of Public Health (DPH) are included in the daily COVID-19 update. \n\nThe case rate per 100,000 includes probable and confirmed cases. Probable and confirmed are defined using the CSTE case definition, which is available online: https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/2020ps/Interim-20-ID-01_COVID-19.pdf\n\nThe population data used to calculate rates is based on the CT DPH population statistics for 2019, which is available online here: https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Health-Information-Systems--Reporting/Population/Population-Statistics. Prior to 5/10/2021, the population estimates from 2018 were used.\n\nData on Connecticut deaths were obtained from the Connecticut Deaths Registry maintained by the DPH Office of Vital Records. Cause of death was determined by a death certifier (e.g., physician, APRN, medical examiner) using their best clinical judgment. Additionally, all COVID-19 deaths, including suspected or related, are required to be reported to OCME. On April 4, 2020, CT DPH and OCME released a joint memo to providers and facilities within Connecticut providing guidelines for certifying deaths due to COVID-19 that were consistent with the CDC\u2019s guidelines and a reminder of the required reporting to OCME.25,26  As of July 1, 2021, OCME had reviewed every case reported and performed additional investigation on about one-third of reported deaths to better ascertain if COVID-19 did or did not cause or contribute to the death. Some of these investigations resulted in the OCME performing postmortem swabs for PCR testing on individuals whose deaths were suspected to be due to COVID-19, but antemortem diagnosis was unable to be made.31  The OCME issued or re-issued about 10% of COVID-19 death certificates and, when appropriate, removed COVID-19 from the death certificate. For standardization and tabulation of mortality statistics, written cause of death statements made by the certifiers on death certificates are sent to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the CDC which assigns cause of death codes according to the International Causes of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) classification system.25,26  CO", "attribution": "Department of Public Health", "attribution_link": "https://portal.ct.gov/coronavirus", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-09-14T20:58:25.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-04-02T03:13:22.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-09-14T20:58:25.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-06-24T19:02:33.000Z", "columns_name": ["Number of indeterminates", "Number of negatives", "Number of positives", "Confirmed deaths", "Town number", "Last update date", "Number of tests", "Confirmed cases", "Town", "Total deaths", "Rate tested per 100k", "Case rate", "Total cases ", "People tested", "Probable deaths", "Probable cases"], "columns_field_name": ["numberofindeterminates", "numberofnegatives", "numberofpositives", "townconfirmeddeaths", "town_no", "lastupdatedate", "numberoftests", "townconfirmedcases", "town", "towntotaldeaths", "ratetested100k", "towncaserate", "towntotalcases", "peopletested", "townprobabledeaths", "townprobablecases"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Number of indeterminate tests", "Number of negative tests", "Number of positive tests", "Number of confirmed COVID-19-associated deaths", "Town number", "Date dataset was last updated", "Number of molecular COVID-19 tests reported", "Number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases", "Town name", "Sum of confirmed and probable COVID-19-associated deaths", "Rate of people tested per 100,000", "Rate of cases per 100,000", "Sum of confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases", "Number of people tested", "Number of probable COVID-19-associated deaths", "Number of probable COVID-19 cases"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"view": "date"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-06-01T19:43:54.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["social services", "public safety", "demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Health and Human Services", "domain_tags": ["covid archive"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Agency_Agency", "value": "Department of Public Health"}, {"key": "Details_Geographic-Unit", "value": "City"}, {"key": "Details_Update-Frequency", "value": "Not updated (historical data)"}, {"key": "COVID-19_Topic", "value": "Tests, cases, hospitalizations, and deaths"}, {"key": "COVID-19_Geography", "value": "Town"}, {"key": "COVID-19_Temporal-coverage", "value": "Cumulative"}, {"key": "COVID-19_Community-vs.-congregate-setting", "value": "Community and congregate settings"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.ct.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.ct.gov/d/28fr-iqnx", "link": "https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-Tests-Cases-and-Deaths-By-Town-ARCHIVE/28fr-iqnx", "owner": {"id": "dby8-627v", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Gary Archambault"}, "creator": {"id": "dby8-627v", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Gary Archambault"}}

Dates are based on date of specimen collection (cases and positivity).\n\nA person is considered a new case only upon their first COVID-19 testing result because a case is defined as an instance or bout of illness. If they are tested again subsequently and are still positive, it still counts toward the test positivity metric but they are not considered another case.\n\nPercent positivity is calculated as the number of positive tests among community residents conducted during the 14 days divided by the total number of positive and negative tests among community residents during the same period.  If someone was tested more than once during that 14 day period, then those multiple test results (regardless of whether they were positive or negative) are included in the calculation.\n\nThese case and test counts do not include cases or tests among people residing in congregate settings, such as nursing homes, assisted living facilities, or correctional facilities.\n\nThese data are updated weekly and reflect the previous two full Sunday-Saturday (MMWR) weeks (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/MMWR_week_overview.pdf).\n\nDPH note about change from 7-day to 14-day metrics:\nPrior to 10/15/2020, these metrics were calculated using a 7-day average rather than a 14-day average. The 7-day metrics are no longer being updated as of 10/15/2020 but the archived dataset can be accessed here: https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-case-rate-per-100-000-population-and-perc/s22x-83rd\n\nAs you know, we are learning more about COVID-19 all the time, including the best ways to measure COVID-19 activity in our communities. CT DPH has decided to shift to 14-day rates because these are more stable, particularly at the town level, as compared to 7-day rates. In addition, since the school indicators were initially published by DPH last summer, CDC has recommended 14-day rates and other states (e.g., Massachusetts) have started to implement 14-day metrics for monitoring COVID transmission as well.\n\nWith respect to geography, we also have learned that many people are looking at the town-level data to inform decision making, despite emphasis on the county-level metrics in the published addenda.

For data on COVID-19 updated (bivalent) booster coverage by town please to go to https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-Updated-Bivalent-Booster-Coverage-By-Town/bqd5-4jgh. \n\nThis table shows the number and percent of residents of each CT town that have initiated COVID-19 vaccination, are fully vaccinated and who have received additional dose 1 by age group.  \n \nAll data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. \n\nIn the data shown here, a person who has received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have initiated vaccination. A person is considered fully vaccinated if he/she has completed a primary vaccination series by receiving 2 doses of the Pfizer, Novavax or Moderna vaccines or 1 dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The fully vaccinated are a subset of the people who have received at least one dose.\n \nA person who completed a Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax or Johnson & Johnson primary series (as defined above) and then had an additional monovalent dose of COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have had additional dose 1. The additional dose may be Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax or Johnson & Johnson and may be a different type from the primary series.  For people who had a primary Pfizer or Moderna series, additional dose 1 was counted starting August 18th, 2021. For people with a Johnson & Johnson primary series additional dose 1 was counted starting October 22nd, 2021. For most people, additional dose 1 is a booster. However, additional dose 1 may represent a supplement to the primary series for a people who is moderately or severely immunosuppressed. Bivalent booster administrations are not included in the additional dose 1 calculations. \n\nThe percent with at least one dose many be over-estimated, and the percent fully vaccinated and with additional dose 1 may be under-estimated because of vaccine administration records for individuals that cannot be linked because of differences in how names or date of birth are reported. \n\nTown of residence is verified by geocoding the reported address and then mapping it a town using municipal boundaries.  If an address cannot be geocoded, the reported town is used.  Out-of-state residents vaccinated by CT providers are excluded from the table.     \n\nThe population denominators for these town- and age-specific coverage estimates are based on 2014 census estimates. This is the most recent year for which reliable town- and age-specific estimates are available. (https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Health-Information-Systems--Reporting/Population/Town-Population-with-Demographics). This census data is grouped in 5-year age bands. For vaccine coverage age groupings not consistent with a standard 5-year age band, each age was assumed to be 20% of the total within a 5-year age band. However, given the large deviation from this assumption for Mansfield because of the presence of the University of Connecticut, the age distribution observed in the 2010 census for the age bands 15 to 19 and 20 to 24 was used to estimate the population denominators. \n\nTown-level coverage estimates have been capped at 100%.  Observed coverage may be greater than 100% for multiple reasons, including census denominator data not including all individuals that currently reside in the town (e.g., part time residents, change in population size since the census), errors in address data or other reporting errors.  \n\nCaution should be used when interpreting coverage estimates for towns with large college/university populations since coverage may be underestimated. In the census, college/university students who live on or just off campus would be counted in the college/university town. However, if a student was vaccinated while studying remotely in his/her hometown, the student may be counted as a vaccine recipient in that town. \n\nConnecticut COVID-19 Vaccine Program p", "attribution": "Department of Public Health", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-02-24T13:59:24.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-04-23T13:40:45.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-02-24T13:59:24.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-09T19:38:59.000Z", "columns_name": ["Additional Dose 1 Received Percent", "Additional Dose 1 Received Count", "Date Updated", "Fully Vaccinated Percent", "Fully Vaccinated Count", "Initiated Vaccination Percent", "Initiated Vaccination Count", "Population", "At least one census tract SVI\u22650.75", "Age Group", "Town"], "columns_field_name": ["additional_dose_1_received_percent", "additional_dose_1_received", "dateupdated", "fully_vaccinated_percent", "fully_vaccinated", "initiated_vaccination_percent", "initiated_vaccination", "population", "at_least_one_census_tract", "age_group", "town"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Additional Dose 1 Received Percent", "Additional Dose 1 Received Count", "Date updated", "Fully vaccinated percent", "Fully vaccinated count", "Initiated vaccination percent", "Initiated vaccination count", "Estimated population", "Yes/no: Indicates whether or not each town has at least one census tract with a Social Vulnerability index 75% or greater", "Age group", "Town name"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {"view": "date"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-04-27T13:34:40.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Health and Human Services", "domain_tags": ["covid-19", "covid vaccination"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Agency_Agency", "value": "Department of Public Health"}, {"key": "Details_Geographic-Unit", "value": "Municipality"}, {"key": "Details_Update-Frequency", "value": "Not updated (historical data)"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.ct.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.ct.gov/d/gngw-ukpw", "link": "https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-Vaccinations-by-Town-and-Age-Group-ARCHIV/gngw-ukpw", "owner": {"id": "dby8-627v", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Gary Archambault"}, "creator": {"id": "dby8-627v", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Gary Archambault"}}

Starting in July 2020, this dataset will no longer be updated and will be replaced by the CMS COVID-19 Nursing Home Dataset, available at the following link: https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/CMS-COVID-19-Nursing-Home-Dataset/w8wc-65i5. \n\nMethods: \n1) Laboratory-confirmed case counts are based upon data reported via the FLIS web portal. Nursing homes were asked to provide cumulative totals of residents with laboratory confirmed covid. This includes residents currently in-house, in the hospital, or who are deceased. Residents were excluded if they tested positive prior to initial admission to the nursing home. \n2) The cumulative number of deaths among nursing home residents is based upon data reported by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. For public health surveillance, COVID-19-associated deaths include persons who tested positive for COVID-19 around the time of death (laboratory-confirmed) and persons whose death certificate lists COVID-19 disease as a cause of death or a significant condition contributing to death (probable).\n \nLimitations:\n1) As of the week of 5/10/20, Point Prevalence Survey testing is being offered to all asymptomatic nursing home residents to inform infection prevention efforts. Point prevalence surveys will be conducted over a period of several weeks. Some nursing homes had adequate testing resources available to conduct surveys prior to this date. Differences in survey timing will impact the number of positive results that a nursing home reports.\n2) Cumulative totals of residents testing positive are being collected rather than individual resident data. Thus we cannot verify the counts, de-duplicate, and/or verify whether there is a record of a positive lab test. This may result in either under- or over-counting.\n3) The number of COVID-19 positive residents and the number of confirmed deaths among residents are tabulated from different data sources. Due to the timing of availability of test results for deceased residents, it is not appropriate to calculate the percent of cases who died due to COVID-19 at any particular facility based upon this data.\n4) The count of deaths reported for 4/14 are not included in this dataset, as they were not broken out by laboratory-confirmed or probable.

The metadata enables searches by:  Site Town, Site Address, Generator Name, Generator ID Number, Manifest ID Number and Date of Shipment.\n\u2022 All of the metadata and scanned images are available electronically via DEEP\u2019s Document Online Search Portal at:  https://filings.deep.ct.gov/DEEPDocumentSearchPortal/\n\u2022 Therefore, it is no longer necessary to visit the DEEP Records Center in Hartford for manifest records or information.\n\u2022 This CT Data dataset \u201cHazardous Waste Portal Manifest Metadata\u201d (or \u201cPortal Manifest Metadata\u201d) was copied from the DEEP Document Online Search Portal, and includes only the metadata \u2013 no images.\n\nWHY USE THE CONNECTICUT OPEN DATA PORTAL MANIFEST METADATA DATASET INSTEAD OF THE DEEP DOCUMENT ONLINE SEARCH PORTAL ITSELF?\nThe Portal Manifest Metadata is a good search tool to use along with the Portal.  Searching the Portal Manifest Metadata can provide the following advantages over searching the Portal: \n\u2022 faster searches, especially for \u201clarge searches\u201d - those with a large number of search returns unlimited number of search returns (Portal is limited to 500);\n\u2022 larger display of search returns;\n\u2022 search returns can be sorted and filtered online in CT Data; and\n\u2022 search returns and the entire dataset can be downloaded from CT Data and used offline (e.g. download to Excel format)\n\u2022 metadata from searches can be copied from CT Data and pasted into the Portal search fields to quickly find single scanned images. \nThe main advantages of the Portal are:\n\u2022 it provides access to scanned images of manifest documents (CT Data does not); and\n\u2022 images can be downloaded one or multiple at a time. \n\nWHAT MANIFESTS ARE INCLUDED IN DEEP\u2019S MANIFEST PERMANENT RECORDS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE VIA THE DEEP DOCUMENT SEARCH PORTAL AND CT OPEN DATA?\nAll hazardous waste manifest records received and maintained by the DEEP Manifest Program; including:\n\u2022 manifests originating from a Connecticut Generator or sent to a Connecticut Destination Facility including manifests accompanying an exported shipment\n\u2022 manifests with RCRA hazardous waste listed on them (such manifests may also have non-RCRA hazardous waste listed)\n\u2022 manifests from a Generator with a Connecticut Generator ID number (permanent or temporary number)\n\u2022 manifests with sufficient quantities of RCRA hazardous waste listed for DEEP to consider the Generator to be a Small or Large Quantity Generator\n\u2022 manifests with PCBs listed on them from 2016 to 6-29-2018.\n\u2022 Note: manifests sent to a CT Destination Facility were indexed by the Connecticut or Out of State Generator.  Searches by CT Designated Facility are not possible unless such facility is the Generator for the purposes of manifesting. \n\nAll other manifests were considered \u201cnon-hazardous\u201d manifests and not scanned.  They were discarded after 2 years in accord with DEEP records retention schedule.  Non-hazardous manifests include:\n\u2022 Manifests with only non-RCRA hazardous waste listed\n\u2022 Manifests from generators that did not have a permanent or temporary Generator ID number\n\u2022 Sometimes non-hazardous manifests were considered \u201cHazar", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2021-07-23T20:29:42.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-05-07T14:28:27.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2021-07-23T20:29:38.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2021-07-23T20:29:42.000Z", "columns_name": ["Date Shipped", "Generator ID Number", "Manifest Number", "Generator Name", "Site Street Address", "Site Town"], "columns_field_name": ["docdate", "id2", "id1", "client", "address", "town"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Date the waste was shipped from the Generator (signature / certification date)", "EPA Generator ID number for the Generator ", "Manifest Tracking Number of the manifest form", "Name of the Generator of the waste at the site ", "Generator Street Address", "Generator Site Town"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-05-08T15:40:37.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["environment", "social services", "transportation"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Environment and Natural Resources", "domain_tags": ["generator", "hazardous waste", "manifest", "rcra", "shipment", "shipped", "waste"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Agency_Agency", "value": "Department of Energy and Environmental Protection"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.ct.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.ct.gov/d/x2z6-swxe", "link": "https://data.ct.gov/Environment-and-Natural-Resources/Hazardous-Waste-Portal-Manifest-Metadata/x2z6-swxe", "owner": {"id": "ytdn-ejsm", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "DEEP Office of Information Management"}, "creator": {"id": "ytdn-ejsm", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "DEEP Office of Information Management"}}

For data on COVID-19 updated (bivalent) booster coverage by town please to go to https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-Updated-Bivalent-Booster-Coverage-By-Town/bqd5-4jgh.\n\nThis table shows the number and percent of residents of each CT town that have initiated COVID-19 vaccination, are fully vaccinated and who have received additional dose 1.  \n\nAll data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. \n\nIn the data shown here, a person who has received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have initiated vaccination. A person is considered fully vaccinated if he/she has completed a primary vaccination series by receiving 2 doses of the Pfizer, Novavax or Moderna vaccines or 1 dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The fully vaccinated are a subset of the people who have received at least one dose.\n \nA person who completed a Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax or Johnson & Johnson primary series (as defined above) and then had an additional monovalent dose of COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have had  additional dose 1. The additional dose may be Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax or Johnson & Johnson and may be a different type from the primary series.  For people who had a primary Pfizer or Moderna series, additional dose 1 was counted starting August 18th, 2021. For people with a Johnson & Johnson primary series additional dose 1 was counted starting October 22nd, 2021. For most people, additional dose 1 is a booster. However, additional dose 1 may represent a supplement to the primary series for a people who is moderately or severely immunosuppressed. Bivalent booster administrations are not included in the additional dose 1 calculations.\n\nThe percent with at least one dose many be over-estimated, and the percent fully vaccinated and with additional dose 1 may be under-estimated because of vaccine administration records for individuals that cannot be linked because of differences in how names or date of birth are reported. \n\nPercentages are calculated using 2019 census data (https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Health-Information-Systems--Reporting/Population/Annual-Town-and-County-Population-for-Connecticut).  \n\nTown of residence is verified by geocoding the reported address and then mapping it to a town using municipal boundaries.  If an address cannot be geocoded, the reported town is used, if available. People for whom an address is not currently available are shown in this table as \u201cAddress pending validation\u201d. Out-of-state residents vaccinated by CT providers are excluded from the table.     \n\nTown-level coverage estimates have been capped at 100%.  Observed coverage may be greater than 100% for multiple reasons, including census denominator data not including all individuals that currently reside in the town (e.g., part time residents, change in population size since the census), errors in address data or other reporting errors.  Also, the percent with at least one dose many be over-estimated, and the percent fully vaccinated and with additional dose 1 may be under-estimated when records for an individual cannot be linked because of differences in how names or date of birth are reported.  \n\nCaution should be used when interpreting coverage estimates for towns with large college/university populations since coverage may be underestimated. In the census, college/university students who live on or just off campus would be counted in the college/university town. However, if a student was vaccinated while studying remotely in his/her hometown, the student may be counted as a vaccine recipient in that town.  \n\nSVI refers to the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index - a measure that combines 15 demographic variables to identify communities most vulnerable to negative health impacts from disasters and public health crises.

As of 6/27/2022, the data will be published in four tables instead of twelve.\n\nThe COVID-19 Cases, Deaths, and Tests by Day dataset contains cases and test data by date of sample submission.  The death data are by date of death.  This dataset is updated daily and contains information back to the beginning of the pandemic.  The data can be found at https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-Cases-Deaths-and-Tests-by-Day/g9vi-2ahj.\n\nThe COVID-19 State Metrics dataset contains over 93 columns of data.  This dataset is updated daily and currently contains information starting June 21, 2022 to the present.  The data can be found at https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-State-Level-Data/qmgw-5kp6 .\n\nThe COVID-19 County Metrics dataset contains 25 columns of data.  This dataset is updated daily and currently contains information starting June 16, 2022 to the present.  The data can be found at https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-County-Level-Data/ujiq-dy22 .\n\nThe COVID-19 Town Metrics dataset contains 16 columns of data.  This dataset is updated daily and currently contains information starting June 16, 2022 to the present.  The data can be found at https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-Town-Level-Data/icxw-cada .   To protect confidentiality, if a town has fewer than 5 cases or positive NAAT tests over the past 7 days, those data will be suppressed.\n\nCOVID-19 cases and associated deaths that have been reported among Connecticut residents, broken out by age group. All data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. Deaths reported to the either the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) or Department of Public Health (DPH) are included in the daily COVID-19 update. \n\nData are reported daily, with timestamps indicated in the daily briefings posted at: portal.ct.gov/coronavirus. Data are subject to future revision as reporting changes.\n\nStarting in July 2020, this dataset will be updated every weekday. \n\nAdditional notes:\nA delay in the data pull schedule occurred on 06/23/2020. Data from 06/22/2020 was processed on 06/23/2020 at 3:30 PM. The normal data cycle resumed with the data for 06/23/2020.\n\nA network outage on 05/19/2020 resulted in a change in the data pull schedule. Data from 5/19/2020 was processed on 05/20/2020 at 12:00 PM. Data from 5/20/2020 was processed on 5/20/2020 8:30 PM. The normal data cycle resumed on 05/20/2020 with the 8:30 PM data pull. As a result of the network outage, the timestamp on the datasets on the Open Data Portal differ from the timestamp in DPH's daily PDF reports.\n\nStarting 5/10/2021, the date field will represent the date this data was updated on data.ct.gov. Previously the date the data was pulled by DPH was listed, which typically coincided with the date before the data was published on data.ct.gov.
