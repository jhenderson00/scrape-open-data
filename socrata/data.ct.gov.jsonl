Dates are based on date of specimen collection (cases and positivity).\n\nA person is considered a new case only upon their first COVID-19 testing result because a case is defined as an instance or bout of illness. If they are tested again subsequently and are still positive, it still counts toward the test positivity metric but they are not considered another case.\n\nPercent positivity is calculated as the number of positive tests among community residents conducted during the 14 days divided by the total number of positive and negative tests among community residents during the same period.  If someone was tested more than once during that 14 day period, then those multiple test results (regardless of whether they were positive or negative) are included in the calculation.\n\nThese case and test counts do not include cases or tests among people residing in congregate settings, such as nursing homes, assisted living facilities, or correctional facilities.\n\nThese data are updated weekly and reflect the previous two full Sunday-Saturday (MMWR) weeks (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/MMWR_week_overview.pdf).\n\nDPH note about change from 7-day to 14-day metrics:\nPrior to 10/15/2020, these metrics were calculated using a 7-day average rather than a 14-day average.

CT DPH has decided to shift to 14-day rates because these are more stable, particularly at the town level, as compared to 7-day rates. In addition, since the school indicators were initially published by DPH last summer, CDC has recommended 14-day rates and other states (e.g., Massachusetts) have started to implement 14-day metrics for monitoring COVID transmission as well.\n\nWith respect to geography, we also have learned that many people are looking at the town-level data to inform decision making, despite emphasis on the county-level metrics in the published addenda.

A person is considered fully vaccinated if he/she has completed a primary vaccination series by receiving 2 doses of the Pfizer, Novavax or Moderna vaccines or 1 dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The fully vaccinated are a subset of the people who have received at least one dose.\n \nA person who completed a Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax or Johnson & Johnson primary series (as defined above) and then had an additional monovalent dose of COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have had additional dose 1. The additional dose may be Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax or Johnson & Johnson and may be a different type from the primary series.  For people who had a primary Pfizer or Moderna series, additional dose 1 was counted starting August 18th, 2021. For people with a Johnson & Johnson primary series additional dose 1 was counted starting October 22nd, 2021. For most people, additional dose 1 is a booster. However, additional dose 1 may represent a supplement to the primary series for a people who is moderately or severely immunosuppressed. Bivalent booster administrations are not included in the additional dose 1 calculations. \n\nThe percent with at least one dose many be over-estimated, and the percent fully vaccinated and with additional dose 1 may be under-estimated because of vaccine administration records for individuals that cannot be linked because of differences in how names or date of birth are reported. \n\nTown of residence is verified by geocoding the reported address and then mapping it a town using municipal boundaries.  If an address cannot be geocoded, the reported town is used.  Out-of-state residents vaccinated by CT providers are excluded from the table.     \n\nThe population denominators for these town- and age-specific coverage estimates are based on 2014 census estimates.

For vaccine coverage age groupings not consistent with a standard 5-year age band, each age was assumed to be 20% of the total within a 5-year age band. However, given the large deviation from this assumption for Mansfield because of the presence of the University of Connecticut, the age distribution observed in the 2010 census for the age bands 15 to 19 and 20 to 24 was used to estimate the population denominators. \n\nTown-level coverage estimates have been capped at 100%.  Observed coverage may be greater than 100% for multiple reasons, including census denominator data not including all individuals that currently reside in the town (e.g., part time residents, change in population size since the census), errors in address data or other reporting errors.  \n\nCaution should be used when interpreting coverage estimates for towns with large college/university populations since coverage may be underestimated. In the census, college/university students who live on or just off campus would be counted in the college/university town. However, if a student was vaccinated while studying remotely in his/her hometown, the student may be counted as a vaccine recipient in that town. \n\nConnecticut COVID-19 Vaccine Program p", "attribution": "Department of Public Health", "attribution_link": "https://portal.ct.gov/DPH", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-08-02T16:19:45.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-04-23T13:40:45.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-08-02T16:19:45.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-09T19:38:59.000Z", "columns_name": ["Additional Dose 1 Received Percent", "Additional Dose 1 Received Count", "Date Updated", "Fully Vaccinated Percent", "Fully Vaccinated Count", "Initiated Vaccination Percent", "Initiated Vaccination Count", "Population", "At least one census tract SVI\u22650.75", "Age Group", "Town"], "columns_field_name": ["additional_dose_1_received_percent", "additional_dose_1_received", "dateupdated", "fully_vaccinated_percent", "fully_vaccinated", "initiated_vaccination_percent", "initiated_vaccination", "population", "at_least_one_census_tract", "age_group", "town"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Additional Dose 1 Received Percent", "Additional Dose 1 Received Count", "Date updated", "Fully vaccinated percent", "Fully vaccinated count", "Initiated vaccination percent", "Initiated vaccination count", "Estimated population", "Yes/no: Indicates whether or not each town has at least one census tract with a Social Vulnerability index 75% or greater", "Age group", "Town name"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {"view": "date"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-04-27T13:34:40.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Health and Human Services", "domain_tags": ["covid-19", "covid archive", "covid vaccination"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Agency_Agency", "value": "Department of Public Health"}, {"key": "Details_Geographic-Unit", "value": "Municipality"}, {"key": "Details_Update-Frequency", "value": "Not updated (historical data)"}, {"key": "Details_Temporal-Coverage", "value": "The COVID-19 Pandemic"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.ct.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.ct.gov/d/gngw-ukpw", "link": "https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-Vaccinations-by-Town-and-Age-Group-ARCHIV/gngw-ukpw", "owner": {"id": "dby8-627v", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Gary Archambault"}, "creator": {"id": "dby8-627v", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Gary Archambault"}}

Due to eligibility policies and operational processes, enrollment can vary slightly after publication. Please be aware of the point-in-time nature of the published data when comparing to other data published or shared by the Department of Social Services, as this data may vary slightly.\n\nAs a general practice, for monthly data sets published on the Open Data Portal, DSS will continue to refresh the monthly enrollment data for three months, after which time it will remain static. For example, when March data is published the data in January and February will be refreshed. When April data is published, February and March data will be refreshed, but January will not change. This allows the Department to account for the most common enrollment variations in published data while also ensuring that data remains as stable as possible over time. In the event of a significant change in enrollment data, the Department may republish reports and will notate such republication dates and reasons accordingly.\nIn March 2020, Connecticut opted to add a new Medicaid coverage group: the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured. Enrollment data on this limited-benefit Medicaid coverage group is being incorporated into Medicaid data effective January 1, 2021. Enrollment data for this coverage group prior to January 1, 2021, was listed under State Funded Medical. Effective January 1, 2021, this coverage group have been separated: (1) the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured is now G06-I and is now listed as a limited benefit plan that rolls up into \u201cProgram Name\u201d of Medicaid and \u201cMedical Benefit Plan\u201d of HUSKY Limited Benefit; (2) the emergency medical coverage has been separated into G06-II as a limited benefit plan that rolls up into \u201cProgram Name\u201d of Emergency Medical and \u201cMedical Benefit Plan\u201d of Other Medical. An historical accounting of enrollment of the specific coverage group starting in calendar year 2020 will also be published separately.\nThis data represents number of active recipients who received benefits under a program in that calendar year and month. A recipient may have received benefits from multiple programs in the same month; if so that recipient will be included in multiple categories in this dataset (counted more than once.)\n2021 is a partial year.\nFor privacy considerations, a count of zero is used for counts less than five.\nNOTE: On April 22, 2019 the methodology for determining HUSKY A Newborn recipients changed, which caused an increase of recipients for that benefit starting in October 2016. We now count recipients recorded in the ImpaCT system as well as in the HIX system for that assistance type, instead using HIX exclusively.\nAlso, corrections in the ImpaCT system for January and February 2019 caused the addition of around 2000 and 3000 recipients respectively, and the counts for many types of assistance (e.g. SNAP) were adjusted upward for those 2 months.\nAlso, the methodology for determining the address of the recipients changed:\n    1. The address of a recipient in the ImpaCT system is now correctly determined specific to that month instead of using the address of the most recent month. This resulted in some shuffling of the recipients among townships starting in October 2016.\n    2. If, in a given month, a recipient has benefit records in both the HIX system and in the ImpaCT system, the address of the recipient is now calculated as follows to resolve conflicts: Use the residential address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the mailing address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the address in HIX. This resulted in a reduction in counts for most townships starting in March 2017 because a single address is now used instead of two when the systems do not agree.\nNOTE: On February 14 2019, the enrollment counts for", "attribution": "DSS", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-08-14T19:19:02.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-09-12T22:50:17.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-08-14T19:19:00.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-08-14T19:19:02.000Z", "columns_name": ["program", "year_month", "active_recipients"], "columns_field_name": ["program", "year_month", "active_recipients"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-09-12T22:52:17.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["finance", "public safety", "economy"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Health and Human Services", "domain_tags": ["department of social services", "dss", "dss enrollment counts", "enrollment counts", "monthly", "program"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Agency_Agency", "value": "Department of Social Services"}, {"key": "Details_Geographic-Unit", "value": "State"}, {"key": "Details_Update-Frequency", "value": "Monthly"}, {"key": "Details_Temporal-Coverage", "value": "2012-2023"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.ct.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.ct.gov/d/sx77-vjbh", "link": "https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/DSS-Program-Participation-by-Month-CY-2012-2023/sx77-vjbh", "owner": {"id": "fdda-4dst", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Vijay Subramaniam"}, "creator": {"id": "fdda-4dst", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Vijay Subramaniam"}}

When a town\u2019s ranking falls below the top quartile in a given fiscal year, the town's designation as a Public Investment Community continues for that year and the following four fiscal years.  As a result, the PIC index includes certain towns carried over from previous fiscal years.\n\nThe PIC index determines eligibility for several financial assistance programs that various agencies administer, including:\n\n-Urban Action Bond Assistance\n-Small Town Economic Assistance Program\n-Community Economic Development Program\n-Residential Mortgage Guarantee Program\n-Education Cost Sharing\n-Malpractice Insurance Purchase Program\n-Connecticut Manufacturing Innovation Fund\n-Enterprise Corridor Zone Designation\n\nMost of the towns included on the PIC index are eligible to elect for assistance under the Small Town Economic Assistance Program (STEAP) in lieu of Urban Action Bond assistance, pursuant to CGS \u00a74-66g(b).  An eligible town\u2019s legislative body (or its board of selectmen if the town\u2019s legislative body is the town meeting) must vote to choose STEAP assistance and the town must notify OPM following the vote.

Enrollment data on this limited-benefit Medicaid coverage group is being incorporated into Medicaid data effective January 1, 2021. \n\nEnrollment data for this coverage group prior to January 1, 2021, was listed under State Funded Medical. An historical accounting of enrollment of the specific coverage group starting in calendar year 2020 will also be published separately.\n\n<b>2018</b>\nOn April 22, 2019 the methodology for determining HUSKY A Newborn recipients changed, which caused an increase of recipients for that benefit starting in October 2016. We now count recipients recorded in the ImpaCT system as well as in the HIX system for that assistance type, instead using HIX exclusively.\n\nAlso, the methodology for determining the address of the recipients changed:\n1. The address of a recipient in the ImpaCT system is now correctly determined specific to that month instead of using the address of the most recent month. This resulted in some shuffling of the recipients among townships starting in October 2016.\n\n2. If, in a given month, a recipient has benefit records in both the HIX system and in the ImpaCT system, the address of the recipient is now calculated as follows to resolve conflicts: Use the residential address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the mailing address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the address in HIX. This resulted in a reduction in counts for most townships starting in March 2017 because a single address is now used instead of two when the systems do not agree.\n\nOn February 14, 2019 the enrollment counts for 2012-2015 across all programs were updated to account for an error in the data integration process. As a result, the count of the number of people served increased by 13% for 2012, 10% for 2013, 8% for 2014 and 4% for 2015. Counts for 2016, 2017 and 2018 remain unchanged.\n\nOn January 16, 2019 these counts were revised to count a recipient in all locations that recipient resided in that year.\n\nOn January 1, 2019 the counts were revised to count a recipient in only one town per year even when the recipient moved within the year.

A person is considered fully vaccinated if they have completed a primary vaccine series by receiving 2 doses of the Pfizer, Novavax or Moderna vaccines or 1 dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The fully vaccinated are a subset of the number who have received at least one dose.    \n\nA person who completed a Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax or Johnson & Johnson primary series (as defined above) and then had an additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have had additional dose 1.

For people who had a primary Pfizer or Moderna series, additional dose 1 was counted starting August 18th, 2021. For people with a Johnson & Johnson primary series additional dose 1 was counted starting October 22nd, 2021. For most people, additional dose 1 is a booster.

Measures of social vulnerability include socioeconomic status, household composition, disability, race, ethnicity, language, and transportation limitations - among others.

Specifically, HUD relies on the most recent three sets of ACS data to ensure that anomalous estimates, due to sampling, do not affect the QCT status of tracts. \n\u00a0\nQCTs are identified for the purpose of Low-Income Housing Credits under IRC Section 42, with the purpose of increasing the availability of low-income rental housing by providing an income tax credit to certain owners of newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated low-income rental housing projects.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nAlso included are the number of households from the 2010 census (the \u201cp0150001\u201d variable), the average poverty rate using the 2014-2018 ACS data (the \u201cpov_rate_18\u201d variable), and the ratio of Tract Average Household Size Adjusted Income Limit to Tract Median Household Income using the 2014-2018 ACS data (the \u201cinc_factor_18\u201d variable). \nFor the last variable mentioned in the previous paragraph, the income limit is the limit for being considered a very low income household (size-adjusted and based on Area Mean Gross Income). This value is divided by the median household income for the given tract, to get a sense of how the limit and median incomes compare. For example, if ratio>1, it implies that the tract is very low income because the limit income is greater than the median income. This ratio is a compact way to include the separate variables for the household income limit and median household income for each tract.", "attribution": "U.S. Department of Housing and Urban

{"resource": {"name": "DSS Medical Benefit Plan Participation CY 2012-2022", "id": "vcsk-xwsy", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "In order to facilitate public review and access, enrollment data published on the Open Data Portal is provided as promptly as possible after the end of each month or year, as applicable to the data set. Due to eligibility policies and operational processes, enrollment can vary slightly after publication. Please be aware of the point-in-time nature of the published data when comparing to other data published or shared by the Department of Social Services, as this data may vary slightly.\n\nAs a general practice, for monthly data sets published on the Open Data Portal, DSS will continue to refresh the monthly enrollment data for three months, after which time it will remain static. For example, when March data is published the data in January and February will be refreshed. When April data is published, February and March data will be refreshed, but January will not change. This allows the Department to account for the most common enrollment variations in published data while also ensuring that data remains as stable as possible over time. In the event of a significant change in enrollment data, the Department may republish reports and will notate such republication dates and reasons accordingly.\nIn March 2020, Connecticut opted to add a new Medicaid coverage group: the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured. Enrollment data on this limited-benefit Medicaid coverage group is being incorporated into Medicaid data effective January 1, 2021. Enrollment data for this coverage group prior to January 1, 2021, was listed under State Funded Medical. An historical accounting of enrollment of the specific coverage group starting in calendar year 2020 will also be published separately.\nThe data represents number of active recipients who received benefits under a medical benefit plan in that calendar year. A recipient may have received benefits from multiple plans in the same year; if so that recipient will be included in multiple categories in this dataset (counted more than once.)\nFor privacy considerations, a count of zero is used for counts less than five.\nNOTE: On April 22, 2019 the methodology for determining HUSKY A Newborn recipients changed, which caused an increase of recipients for that benefit starting in October 2016. We now count recipients recorded in the ImpaCT system as well as in the HIX system for that assistance type, instead using HIX exclusively.\nAlso, the methodology for determining the address of the recipients changed:\n    1. The address of a recipient in the ImpaCT system is now correctly determined specific to that month instead of using the address of the most recent month. This resulted in some shuffling of the recipients among townships starting in October 2016.\n    2. If, in a given month, a recipient has benefit records in both the HIX system and in the ImpaCT system, the address of the recipient is now calculated as follows to resolve conflicts: Use the residential address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the mailing address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the address in HIX. This resulted in a reduction in counts for most townships starting in March 2017 because a single address is now used instead of two when the systems do not agree.\nNOTE: On February 14 2019, the enrollment counts for 2012-2015 across all programs were updated to account for an error in the data integration process. As a result, the count of the number of people served increased by 13% for 2012, 10% for 2013, 8% for 2014 and 4% for 2015. Counts for 2016, 2017 and 2018 remain unchanged.\nNOTE: On 11/30/2018 the counts were revised because of a change in the way active recipients were counted in one source system.", "attribution": "DSS", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-04-11T17:50:40.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-09-12T19:01:25.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-04-11T17:50:39.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-04-11T17:50:40.000Z", "columns_name": ["active_recipients", "year", "medical_benefit_plan"], "columns_field_name": ["active_recipients", "year", "medical_benefit_plan"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-09-12T19:02:43.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["finance", "public safety"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Health and Human Services", "domain_tags": ["department of social services", "dss", "dss enrollment counts", "enrollment counts", "medical benefit plan"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Agency_Agency", "value": "Department of Social Services"}, {"key": "Details_Geographic-Unit", "value": "State"}, {"key": "Details_Update-Frequency", "value": "Annually"}, {"key": "Details_Temporal-Coverage", "value": "2012-2022"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.ct.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.ct.gov/d/vcsk-xwsy", "link": "https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/DSS-Medical-Benefit-Plan-Participation-CY-2012-202/vcsk-xwsy", "owner": {"id": "fdda-4dst", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Vijay Subramaniam"}, "creator": {"id": "fdda-4dst", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Vijay Subramaniam"}}

View the full dataset and detailed metadata here: https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/anag-cw7u\n\nThe following dataset provides facility-level data for hospital utilization aggregated on a weekly basis (Friday to Thursday). These are derived from reports with facility-level granularity across two main sources: (1) HHS TeleTracking, and (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities.\n\nThe hospital population includes all hospitals registered with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as of June 1, 2020. It includes non-CMS hospitals that have reported since July 15, 2020. It does not include psychiatric, rehabilitation, Indian Health Service (IHS) facilities, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities, Defense Health Agency (DHA) facilities, and religious non-medical facilities.\n\nFor a given entry, the term \u201ccollection_week\u201d signifies the start of the period that is aggregated. For example, a \u201ccollection_week\u201d of 2020-11-20 means the average/sum/coverage of the elements captured from that given facility starting and including Friday, November 20, 2020, and ending and including reports for Thursday, November 26, 2020.\n\nReported elements include an append of either \u201c_coverage\u201d, \u201c_sum\u201d, or \u201c_avg\u201d.\n\nA \u201c_coverage\u201d append denotes how many times the facility reported that element during that collection week.\n\nA \u201c_sum\u201d append denotes the sum of the reports provided for that facility for that element during that collection week.\n\nA \u201c_avg\u201d append is the average of the reports provided for that facility for that element during that collection week.\n\nThe file will be updated weekly. No statistical analysis is applied to impute non-response. For averages, calculations are based on the number of values collected for a given hospital in that collection week. Suppression is applied to the file for sums and averages less than four (4). In these cases, the field will be replaced with \u201c-999,999\u201d.\n\nThis data is preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. Data is available starting on July 31, 2020.\n\nSometimes, reports for a given facility will be provided to both HHS TeleTracking and HHS Protect. When this occurs, to ensure that there are not duplicate reports, deduplication is applied according to prioritization rules within HHS Protect.\n\nFor influenza fields listed in the file, the current HHS guidance marks these fields as optional. As a result, coverage of these elements are varied.\n\nOn May 3, 2021, the following fields have been added to this data set.\nhhs_ids\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed_7_day_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_pediatric_covid_confirmed_7_day_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected_7_day_coverage\nprevious_day_admission_pediatric_covid_suspected_7_day_coverage\nprevious_week_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_administered_7_day_sum\ntotal_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_none_7_day_sum\ntotal_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_one_7_day_sum\ntotal_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_all_7_day_sum\nprevious_week_patients_covid_vaccinated_doses_one_7_day_sum\nprevious_week_patients_covid_vaccinated_doses_all_7_day_sum\n\n\nOn May 8, 2021, this data set has been converted to a corrected data set. The corrections applied to this data set are to smooth out data anomalies caused by keyed in data errors. To help determine which records have had corrections made to it. An additional Boolean field called is_corrected has been added.

To view the full dataset and filter the data, click the \"View Data\" button at the top right of the screen. More data on people served by DSS can be found <a href=\"https://data.ct.gov/browse?tags=dss%20enrollment%20counts\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n\n<b>About this data</b>\n  <li>For privacy considerations, a count of zero is used for counts less than five.</li>\n  <li>A recipient is counted in all towns where that recipient resided in that year.</li>\n  <li>Due to eligibility policies and operational processes, enrollment can vary slightly after publication. Please be aware of the point-in-time nature of the published data when comparing to other data published or shared by the Department of Social Services, as this data may vary slightly.</li>\n\n<b>Notes by year</b>\n<b>2021</b>\nIn March 2020, Connecticut opted to add a new Medicaid coverage group: the COVID-19 Testing Coverage for the Uninsured. Enrollment data on this limited-benefit Medicaid coverage group is being incorporated into Medicaid data effective January 1, 2021. \n\nEnrollment data for this coverage group prior to January 1, 2021, was listed under State Funded Medical. An historical accounting of enrollment of the specific coverage group starting in calendar year 2020 will also be published separately.\n\n<b>2018</b>\nOn April 22, 2019 the methodology for determining HUSKY A Newborn recipients changed, which caused an increase of recipients for that benefit starting in October 2016. We now count recipients recorded in the ImpaCT system as well as in the HIX system for that assistance type, instead using HIX exclusively.\n\nAlso, the methodology for determining the address of the recipients changed:\n1. The address of a recipient in the ImpaCT system is now correctly determined specific to that month instead of using the address of the most recent month. This resulted in some shuffling of the recipients among townships starting in October 2016.\n\n2. If, in a given month, a recipient has benefit records in both the HIX system and in the ImpaCT system, the address of the recipient is now calculated as follows to resolve conflicts: Use the residential address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the mailing address in ImpaCT if it exists, else use the address in HIX. This resulted in a reduction in counts for most townships starting in March 2017 because a single address is now used instead of two when the systems do not agree.\n\nOn February 14, 2019 the enrollment counts for 2012-2015 across all programs were updated to account for an error in the data integration process. As a result, the count of the number of people served increased by 13% for 2012, 10% for 2013, 8% for 2014 and 4% for 2015. Counts for 2016, 2017 and 2018 remain unchanged.\n\nOn January 16, 2019 these counts were revised to count a recipient in all locations that recipient resided in that year.\n\nOn January 1, 2019 the counts were revised to count a recipient in only one town per year even when the recipient moved within the year.

It includes people of all ages.   \n\nAll data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. \n\nA person who has received at least one dose of any vaccine is considered to have initiated vaccination. A person is considered fully vaccinated if they have completed a primary series by receiving 2 doses of the Pfizer, Novavax or Moderna vaccines or 1 dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The fully vaccinated are a subset of the number who have received at least one dose.  \n\nRace and ethnicity data may be self-reported or taken from an existing electronic health care record.   Reported race and ethnicity information is used to create a single race/ethnicity variable. People with Hispanic ethnicity are classified as Hispanic regardless of reported race.  People with a missing ethnicity are classified as non-Hispanic. People with more than one race are classified as multiple race. \n\nA vaccine coverage percentage cannot be calculated for people classified as NH Other race or NH Unknown race since there are not population size estimates for these groups. Data quality assurance activities suggest that NH Other may represent a missing value. Vaccine coverage estimates in specific race/ethnicity groups may be underestimated as result of the exclusion of records classified as NH Unknown Race or NH Other Race.   \n\nTown of residence is verified by geocoding the reported address and then mapping it a town using municipal boundaries.  If an address cannot be geocoded, the reported town is used. \nTown-level coverage estimates have been capped at 100%.  Observed coverage may be greater than 100% for multiple reasons, including census denominator data not including all individuals that currently reside in the town (e.g., part time residents, change in population size since the census) or potential data reporting errors.\nThe population denominators for these town- and age-specific coverage estimates are based on 2014 census estimates. This is the most recent year for which reliable town- and age-specific estimates are available. (https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Health-Information-Systems--Reporting/Population/Town-Population-with-Demographics).  Changes in the size and composition of the population between 2014 and 2021 may results in inaccuracy in vaccine coverage estimates.  For example, the size of the Hispanic population may be underestimated in a town given the reported increase in the size of the Hispanic population between the 2010 and 2020 censuses resulting in inflated vaccine coverage estimates. \n\nThe 2014 census data are grouped in 5-year age bands. For vaccine coverage age groupings not consistent with a standard 5-year age band, each age was assumed to be 20% of the total within a 5-year age band. However, given the large deviation from this assumption for Mansfield because of the presence of the University of Connecticut, the age distribution observed in the 2010 census for the age bands 15 to 19 and 20 to 24 was used to estimate the population denominators.  \n\nThis table does not included doses administered to CT residents by out-of-state providers or by some Federal entities (including Department of Defense, Department of Correction, Department of Veteran\u2019s Affairs, Indian Health Service) because they are not yet reported to CT WiZ (the CT immunization Information System).  It is expected that these data will be added in the future. \n\nCaution should be used when interpreting coverage estimates for towns with large college/university populations since coverage may be underestimated. In the census, college/university students who live on or just off campus would be counted in the college/university town.

For information related to releases reported to CT DEEP from July 1, 2022 to the present, go to  Incident Reports for Releases Reported to CT DEEP July 1, 2022 to present at: https://connecticut.hazconnect.com/listincidentpublic.aspx\n\nFor a dataset related to releases reported to CT DEEP from July 1, 2022 to recent refer to the CT Open Data dataset:  https://data.ct.gov/Environment-and-Natural-Resources/Spill-Incidents-from-July-1-2022-to-Recent-for-Dow/ffju-s5c5\n\nConnecticut General Statutes Section 22a-450 requires anyone who causes any discharge, spillage, uncontrolled loss, seepage or filtration of oil or petroleum or chemical liquids or solid, liquid or gaseous products, or hazardous wastes which poses a potential threat to human health or the environment to report that release to the CT DEEP.  Reports of releases from other persons are also included in this dataset.\n\nExamples of what may be included in a spill incident record includes: Administrative information (unique spill case number). Spill date/time. Location. Spill source and cause. Material(s) and material type spilled. Quantity spilled. Measurement units. Surface water bodies affected. \n\nData limitations and factors to consider when using this data: \nThis data is limited to information about a spill incident as it was known at the time it was reported to CT DEEP. Although some data reflects updated information after the time of the initial notification, CT DEEP is unable to field check and verify all reported information.  Therefore, information later determined to be incomplete or inaccurate may exist in this data set.  There may also be spelling errors or other unintentionally inaccurate data that was transcribed in the spill incident report.\n\nThis dataset is a subset of records and information that may be available about releases that have occurred at specific locations.  This dataset does not replace a full review of files publicly available either on-line and/or at CT DEEP\u2019s Records Center. \n\nFor a complete review of agency records for this or other agency programs, you can perform your own search in our DEEP public file room located at 79 Elm Street, Hartford CT or at our DEEP Online Search Portal at:  https://filings.deep.ct.gov/DEEPDocumentSearchPortal/Home .\n\nIf errors are found or there are questions about the data, please contact the program unit using the following email address: DEEP.SpillsDocs@ct.gov", "attribution": "Department of Energy & Environmental Protection, Emergency Response and Spill Prevention Division", "attribution_link": "https://portal.ct.gov/DEEP/Emergency-Response-and-Spill-Prevention/Overview---Emergency-Response-and-Spill-Prevention-Division", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-08-21T19:11:56.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-12-18T21:24:22.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-08-21T19:11:56.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-07-31T15:24:20.000Z", "columns_name": ["Release Type", "Location Of Reported Release", "Media Info", "Cause Info", "Corrective Actions Taken", "Waterbodies Affected", "Type of Waterbody Affected", "Emergency Measures", "Total Quantity Pounds", "Total Quantity Drums", "Total Quantity Feet", "Total Quantity Yards", "Total Quantity Gallons", "Release Substance", "Responsible Party Accepts Responsibility (Y/N)", "Responsible Party Zip", "Responsible Party State", "Responsible Party Town", "Responsible Party Address", "Responsibile Party/Discharger", "Representing", "Reported By", "Status", "State of Release", "Town of Release", "Release date and time", "Date Reported Time Reported", "Assigned to", "Case No.", "Year"], "columns_field_name": ["releasetype", "location", "mediainfo", "causeinfo", "actions", "waterbodiesaffected", "waterbody", "emergencymeasures", "quanlbs", "quandrums", "quanfeet", "quanyards", "quangallons", "releasesubstance", "responsibility", "repzip", "repstate", "reptown", "repstreet", "discharger", "representing", "reportedby", "status", "stateofrelease", "townrelease", "releasedatetime", "date_reported_time_reported", "assignedto", "caseno", "year"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Checkbox", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["The categories of the reported substance(s) released:  petroleum, chemical, dialect,  hazardous waste, sewage related, biomedical, gas emission, other, or not specified.", "Any known address or geographic information associated with the location of the incident as it was reported. -- this may or may not be the originating location of the release", "The environmental media or setting affected by the release", "Cause of incident, if known", "Response actions taken to address the release, if known at the time of the incident\u2019s report to CT DEEP  ", "Waterbody name(s) if known or expected to be affected", "If known, the type of waterbody affected, such as a lake, stream, catch basins", "Additional information regarding the incident ", "Amount in Pounds of substance spilled or found -- \u201c0\u201d indicates indicates zero or can indicate an unknown amount.

Nursing homes were asked to provide cumulative totals of residents with laboratory confirmed covid. This includes residents currently in-house, in the hospital, or who are deceased. Residents were excluded if they tested positive prior to initial admission to the nursing home. \n2) The cumulative number of deaths among nursing home residents is based upon data reported by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. For public health surveillance, COVID-19-associated deaths include persons who tested positive for COVID-19 around the time of death (laboratory-confirmed) and persons whose death certificate lists COVID-19 disease as a cause of death or a significant condition contributing to death (probable).\n \nLimitations:\n1) As of the week of 5/10/20, Point Prevalence Survey testing is being offered to all asymptomatic nursing home residents to inform infection prevention efforts. Point prevalence surveys will be conducted over a period of several weeks. Some nursing homes had adequate testing resources available to conduct surveys prior to this date. Differences in survey timing will impact the number of positive results that a nursing home reports.\n2) Cumulative totals of residents testing positive are being collected rather than individual resident data. Thus we cannot verify the counts, de-duplicate, and/or verify whether there is a record of a positive lab test. This may result in either under- or over-counting.\n3) The number of COVID-19 positive residents and the number of confirmed deaths among residents are tabulated from different data sources. Due to the timing of availability of test results for deceased residents, it is not appropriate to calculate the percent of cases who died due to COVID-19 at any particular facility based upon this data.\n4) The count of deaths reported for 4/14 are not included in this dataset, as they were not broken out by laboratory-confirmed or probable.

The metadata enables searches by:  Site Town, Site Address, Generator Name, Generator ID Number, Manifest ID Number and Date of Shipment.\n\u2022 All of the metadata and scanned images are available electronically via DEEP\u2019s Document Online Search Portal at:  https://filings.deep.ct.gov/DEEPDocumentSearchPortal/\n\u2022 Therefore, it is no longer necessary to visit the DEEP Records Center in Hartford for manifest records or information.\n\u2022 This CT Data dataset \u201cHazardous Waste Portal Manifest Metadata\u201d (or \u201cPortal Manifest Metadata\u201d) was copied from the DEEP Document Online Search Portal, and includes only the metadata \u2013 no images.\n\nWHY USE THE CONNECTICUT OPEN DATA PORTAL MANIFEST METADATA DATASET INSTEAD OF THE DEEP DOCUMENT ONLINE SEARCH PORTAL ITSELF?\nThe Portal Manifest Metadata is a good search tool to use along with the Portal.  Searching the Portal Manifest Metadata can provide the following advantages over searching the Portal: \n\u2022 faster searches, especially for \u201clarge searches\u201d - those with a large number of search returns unlimited number of search returns (Portal is limited to 500);\n\u2022 larger display of search returns;\n\u2022 search returns can be sorted and filtered online in CT Data; and\n\u2022 search returns and the entire dataset can be downloaded from CT Data and used offline (e.g. download to Excel format)\n\u2022 metadata from searches can be copied from CT Data and pasted into the Portal search fields to quickly find single scanned images. \nThe main advantages of the Portal are:\n\u2022 it provides access to scanned images of manifest documents (CT Data does not); and\n\u2022 images can be downloaded one or multiple at a time. \n\nWHAT MANIFESTS ARE INCLUDED IN DEEP\u2019S MANIFEST PERMANENT RECORDS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE VIA THE DEEP DOCUMENT SEARCH PORTAL AND CT OPEN DATA?\nAll hazardous waste manifest records received and maintained by the DEEP Manifest Program; including:\n\u2022 manifests originating from a Connecticut Generator or sent to a Connecticut Destination Facility including manifests accompanying an exported shipment\n\u2022 manifests with RCRA hazardous waste listed on them (such manifests may also have non-RCRA hazardous waste listed)\n\u2022 manifests from a Generator with a Connecticut Generator ID number (permanent or temporary number)\n\u2022 manifests with sufficient quantities of RCRA hazardous waste listed for DEEP to consider the Generator to be a Small or Large Quantity Generator\n\u2022 manifests with PCBs listed on them from 2016 to 6-29-2018.\n\u2022 Note: manifests sent to a CT Destination Facility were indexed by the Connecticut or Out of State Generator.  Searches by CT Designated Facility are not possible unless such facility is the Generator for the purposes of manifesting. \n\nAll other manifests were considered \u201cnon-hazardous\u201d manifests and not scanned.  They were discarded after 2 years in accord with DEEP records retention schedule.  Non-hazardous manifests include:\n\u2022 Manifests with only non-RCRA hazardous waste listed\n\u2022 Manifests from generators that did not have a permanent or temporary Generator ID number\n\u2022 Sometimes non-hazardous manifests were considered \u201cHazar", "attribution": "Bureau of Materials Management and Compliance Assurance, Waste Engineering and Enforcement Division", "attribution_link": "https://portal.ct.gov/DEEP/Waste-Management-and-Disposal/Hazardous-Waste/Obtaining-Manifest-Data", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-08-17T16:01:48.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-05-07T14:28:27.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-08-17T16:01:48.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2021-07-23T20:29:42.000Z", "columns_name": ["Date Shipped", "Generator ID Number", "Manifest Number", "Generator Name", "Site Street Address", "Site Town"], "columns_field_name": ["docdate", "id2", "id1", "client", "address", "town"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Date the waste was shipped from the Generator (signature / certification date)", "EPA Generator ID number for the Generator ", "Manifest Tracking Number of the manifest form", "Name of the Generator of the waste at the site ", "Generator Street Address", "Generator Site Town"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-05-08T15:40:37.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["environment", "social services", "transportation"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Environment and Natural Resources", "domain_tags": ["generator", "hazardous waste", "manifest", "rcra", "shipment", "shipped", "waste"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Agency_Agency", "value": "Department of Energy and Environmental Protection"}, {"key": "Details_Geographic-Unit", "value": "Street address"}, {"key": "Details_Update-Frequency", "value": "As needed"}, {"key": "Details_Temporal-Coverage", "value": "Metadata for Sanning project completed in 2021, corrections may be published as needed"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.ct.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.ct.gov/d/x2z6-swxe", "link": "https://data.ct.gov/Environment-and-Natural-Resources/Hazardous-Waste-Portal-Manifest-Metadata/x2z6-swxe", "owner": {"id": "ytdn-ejsm", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "DEEP Office of Information Management"}, "creator": {"id": "ytdn-ejsm", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "DEEP Office of Information Management"}}

For data on COVID-19 updated (bivalent) booster coverage by town please to go to https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-Updated-Bivalent-Booster-Coverage-By-Town/bqd5-4jgh.\n\nThis table shows the number and percent of residents of each CT town that have initiated COVID-19 vaccination, are fully vaccinated and who have received additional dose 1.  \n\nAll data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. \n\nIn the data shown here, a person who has received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have initiated vaccination. A person is considered fully vaccinated if he/she has completed a primary vaccination series by receiving 2 doses of the Pfizer, Novavax or Moderna vaccines or 1 dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The fully vaccinated are a subset of the people who have received at least one dose.\n \nA person who completed a Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax or Johnson & Johnson primary series (as defined above) and then had an additional monovalent dose of COVID-19 vaccine is considered to have had  additional dose 1. The additional dose may be Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax or Johnson & Johnson and may be a different type from the primary series.  For people who had a primary Pfizer or Moderna series, additional dose 1 was counted starting August 18th, 2021. For people with a Johnson & Johnson primary series additional dose 1 was counted starting October 22nd, 2021. For most people, additional dose 1 is a booster. However, additional dose 1 may represent a supplement to the primary series for a people who is moderately or severely immunosuppressed. Bivalent booster administrations are not included in the additional dose 1 calculations.\n\nThe percent with at least one dose many be over-estimated, and the percent fully vaccinated and with additional dose 1 may be under-estimated because of vaccine administration records for individuals that cannot be linked because of differences in how names or date of birth are reported. \n\nPercentages are calculated using 2019 census data (https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Health-Information-Systems--Reporting/Population/Annual-Town-and-County-Population-for-Connecticut).  \n\nTown of residence is verified by geocoding the reported address and then mapping it to a town using municipal boundaries.  If an address cannot be geocoded, the reported town is used, if available. People for whom an address is not currently available are shown in this table as \u201cAddress pending validation\u201d. Out-of-state residents vaccinated by CT providers are excluded from the table.     \n\nTown-level coverage estimates have been capped at 100%.  Observed coverage may be greater than 100% for multiple reasons, including census denominator data not including all individuals that currently reside in the town (e.g., part time residents, change in population size since the census), errors in address data or other reporting errors.  Also, the percent with at least one dose many be over-estimated, and the percent fully vaccinated and with additional dose 1 may be under-estimated when records for an individual cannot be linked because of differences in how names or date of birth are reported.  \n\nCaution should be used when interpreting coverage estimates for towns with large college/university populations since coverage may be underestimated. In the census, college/university students who live on or just off campus would be counted in the college/university town. However, if a student was vaccinated while studying remotely in his/her hometown, the student may be counted as a vaccine recipient in that town.  \n\nSVI refers to the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index - a measure that combines 15 demographic variables to identify communities most vulnerable to negative health impacts from disasters and public health crises.

The fully vaccinated are a subset of the number who have received at least one dose. The number with At Least One Dose and the number Fully Vaccinated add up to more than the total number of doses because people who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine fit into both categories.\n\nIn this data, a person with reported Hispanic or Latino ethnicity is considered Hispanic regardless of reported race.

The data can be found at https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-Town-Level-Data/icxw-cada .   To protect confidentiality, if a town has fewer than 5 cases or positive NAAT tests over the past 7 days, those data will be suppressed.\n\nCOVID-19 cases and associated deaths that have been reported among Connecticut residents, broken out by age group. All data in this report are preliminary; data for previous dates will be updated as new reports are received and data errors are corrected. Deaths reported to the either the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) or Department of Public Health (DPH) are included in the daily COVID-19 update. \n\nData are reported daily, with timestamps indicated in the daily briefings posted at: portal.ct.gov/coronavirus. Data are subject to future revision as reporting changes.\n\nStarting in July 2020, this dataset will be updated every weekday. \n\nAdditional notes:\nA delay in the data pull schedule occurred on 06/23/2020. Data from 06/22/2020 was processed on 06/23/2020 at 3:30 PM. The normal data cycle resumed with the data for 06/23/2020.\n\nA network outage on 05/19/2020 resulted in a change in the data pull schedule. Data from 5/19/2020 was processed on 05/20/2020 at 12:00 PM. Data from 5/20/2020 was processed on 5/20/2020 8:30 PM. The normal data cycle resumed on 05/20/2020 with the 8:30 PM data pull.
