Data includes the following estimates: personal income, per capita personal income, wages and salaries, supplements to wages and salaries, private nonfarm earnings, compensation of employees, average compensation per job, and private nonfarm compensation.\n\nPersonal income is defined as the sum of wages and salaries, supplements to wages and salaries, proprietors\u2019 income, dividends, interest, and rent, and personal current transfer receipts, less contributions for government social insurance.  Personal income for Iowa is the income received by, or on behalf of all persons residing in Iowa, regardless of the duration of residence, except for foreign nationals employed by their home governments in Iowa.  Per capita personal income is personal income divided by the Census Bureau\u2019s annual midyear (July 1) population estimates.\n\nWages and salaries is defined as the remuneration receivable by employees (including corporate officers) from employers for the provision of labor services. It includes commissions, tips, and bonuses; employee gains from exercising stock options; and pay-in-kind. Judicial fees paid to jurors and witnesses are classified as wages and salaries. Wages and salaries are measured before deductions, such as social security contributions, union dues, and voluntary employee contributions to defined contribution pension plans.\n\nSupplements to wages and salaries consists of employer contributions for government social insurance and employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds.\n\nPrivate nonfarm earnings is the sum of wages and salaries, supplements to wages and salaries, and nonfarm proprietors' income, excluding farm and government.\n\nCompensation to employees is the total remuneration, both monetary and in kind, payable by employers to employees in return for their work during the period.  It consists of wages and salaries and of supplements to wages and salaries.  Compensation is presented on an accrual basis - that is, it reflects compensation liabilities incurred by the employer in a given period regardless of when the compensation is actually received by the employee.\n\nAverage compensation per job is compensation of employees divided by total full-time and part-time wage and salary employment.\n\nPrivate nonfarm compensation is the sum of wages and salaries and supplements to wages and salaries, excluding farm and government.\n\nMore terms and definitions are available on https://apps.bea.gov/regional/definitions/.", "attribution": "U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis (SAINC1, SAINC4, SAINC5N, and SAINC6N)", "attribution_link": "https://apps.bea.gov/api", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-01T04:59:49.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-01-24T23:19:25.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-01T04:59:46.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-06-01T04:59:49.000Z", "columns_name": ["Variable", "Table Name", "Variable Code", "Table Code", "Date", "Row ID", "Value", "Variable Unit", "Rating Areas for Iowa Individual Affordable Care Act Premiums", "Iowa Regional Zip Codes", "County Boundaries of Iowa"], "columns_field_name": ["variable", "table_name", "variable_code", "table_code", "date", "row_id", "value", "variable_unit", ":@computed_region_hhz5_dst4", ":@computed_region_g8ff_h7ce", ":@computed_region_y683_txed"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Description of the variable", "Name for annual series table: Personal Income Summary (SAINC1), Personal Income and Employment by Major Component (SAINC4), Personal Income by Major Component and Earnings by NAICS Industry (SAINC5N), and Wages and Salaries by NAICS Industry (SAINC7N)", "Unique identifier for the variable reported", "Code for annual series table: SAINC1, SAINC4, SAINC5N, and SAINC6N.", "Date the annual period ended that the reported value is for", "Unique row identifier for the variable and time period", "Value reported for the time period", "Units associated with the value reported", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {"view": "date"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "currency", "precision": "0"}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-02-10T17:49:16.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["finance", "economy", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Economic Statistics", "domain_tags": ["avg compensation per job", "bea", "employee compensation", "naics", "nonfarm compensation", "nonfarm earnings", "per capita personal income", "personal income", "u.s. bureau of economic analysis", "wages and salaries"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Data-Use_Limitations", "value": "Values should not be aggregated across multiple variables or time periods."}, {"key": "Data-Use_Terms-of-Use", "value": "See license.

Data includes the following estimates: personal income, per capita personal income, proprietors' income, farm proprietors' income, compensation of employees and private nonfarm earnings, compensation, and wages and salaries for wholesale trade.  Personal income, proprietors' income, and farm proprietors' income available beginning 1997; per capita personal income available beginning 2010; and all other data beginning 1998.\n\nPersonal income is defined as the sum of wages and salaries, supplements to wages and salaries, proprietors\u2019 income, dividends, interest, and rent, and personal current transfer receipts, less contributions for government social insurance.  Personal income for Iowa is the income received by, or on behalf of all persons residing in Iowa, regardless of the duration of residence, except for foreign nationals employed by their home governments in Iowa.  Per capita personal income is personal income divided by the Census Bureau\u2019s midquarter population estimates.\n\nProprietors' income is the current-production income (including income in kind) of sole proprietorships, partnerships, and tax-exempt cooperatives. Corporate directors' fees are included in proprietors' income. Proprietors' income includes the interest income received by financial partnerships and the net rental real estate income of those partnerships primarily engaged in the real estate business.\n\nFarm proprietors\u2019 income as measured for personal income reflects returns from current production; it does not measure current cash flows. Sales out of inventories are included in current gross farm income, but they are excluded from net farm income because they represent income from a previous year\u2019s production.\n\nCompensation to employees is the total remuneration, both monetary and in kind, payable by employers to employees in return for their work during the period.  It consists of wages and salaries and of supplements to wages and salaries.  Compensation is presented on an accrual basis - that is, it reflects compensation liabilities incurred by the employer in a given period regardless of when the compensation is actually received by the employee.\n\nPrivate nonfarm earnings is the sum of wages and salaries, supplements to wages and salaries, and nonfarm proprietors' income, excluding farm and government.\n\nPrivate nonfarm wages and salaries is wages and salaries excluding farm and government.  Wages and salaries is the remuneration receivable by employees (including corporate officers) from employers for the provision of labor services. It includes commissions, tips, and bonuses; employee gains from exercising stock options; and pay-in-kind. Judicial fees paid to jurors and witnesses are classified as wages and salaries. Wages and salaries are measured before deductions, such as social security contributions, union dues, and voluntary employee contributions to defined contribution pension plans.\n\nMore terms and definitions are available on https://apps.bea.gov/regional/definitions/.", "attribution": "U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis (Table SQINC1, Variable SQINC1-3)", "attribution_link": "https://apps.bea.gov/api", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-01T05:12:10.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-01-24T23:18:03.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-01T05:12:06.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-06-01T05:12:10.000Z", "columns_name": ["Variable", "Variable Unit", "Variable Code", "Table Name", "Row ID", "Date", "Table Code", "Value", "Iowa Regional Zip Codes", "County Boundaries of Iowa", "Rating Areas for Iowa Individual Affordable Care Act Premiums"], "columns_field_name": ["variable", "variable_unit", "variable_code", "table_name", "row_id", "date", "table_code", "value", ":@computed_region_g8ff_h7ce", ":@computed_region_y683_txed", ":@computed_region_hhz5_dst4"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Description of the variable", "Units associated with the value reported", "Unique identifier for the variable reported, and year variable data first became available: SQINC1-1 (1997), SQINC1-3 (2010), SQINC4-30 (2010), SQINC4-70 (1997), SQINC4-71 (1997), SQINC5N-30 (2010), SQINC5N-600 (1998), SQINC5N-70 (1998), SQINC5N-71 (1998), SQINC6N-1 (1998), SQINC6N-600 (1998), and SQINC7N-600 (1998)", "Name of the quarterly series table: Personal Income (SQINC1), Personal Income by Major Component (SQINC4), Personal Income by Major Component and Earnings by NAICS Industry (SQINC5N), Compensation of Employees by NAICS Industry (SQINC6N), and Wages and Salaries by NAICS Industry (SQINC7N)", "Unique row identifier for the variable and time period", "Date the quarterly period ended that the reported value is for", "Code for the quarterly series table: SQINC1, SQINC4, SQINC5N, SQINC6N, and SQINC7N", "Value reported for the time period", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"view": "date"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "currency", "precision": "0"}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-02-10T17:12:27.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["finance", "economy", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Economic Statistics", "domain_tags": ["bea", "employee compensation", "naics", "nonfarm earnings", "nonfarm wages and salaries", "per capita personal income", "personal income", "proprietor's income", "u.s. bureau of economic analysis"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Data-Use_Limitations", "value": "Values should not be aggregated across multiple variables or time periods."}, {"key": "Data-Use_Completeness", "value": "Personal income, proprietors' income, and farm proprietors' income available beginning 1997; per capita personal income available beginning 2010; and all other beginning 1998.

Watershed Boundaries are determined solely upon science-based hydrologic principles, not favoring any administrative boundaries or special projects, nor particular program or agency. The intent of defining Hydrologic Units (HU) for the Watershed Boundary Dataset is to establish a base-line drainage boundary framework, accounting for all land and surface areas. At a minimum, the WBD is being delineated and georeferenced to the USGS 1:24,000 scale topographic base map meeting National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS). Hydrologic units are given a Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC). For example, a hydrologic region has a 2-digit HUC. A HUC describes where the unit is in the country and the level of the unit.\n\n\"A hydrologic unit is a drainage area delineated to nest in a multi-level, hierarchical drainage system. Its boundaries are defined by hydrographic and topographic criteria that delineate an area of land upstream from a specific point on a river, stream or similar surface waters. A hydrologic unit can accept surface water directly from upstream drainage areas, and indirectly from associated surface areas such as remnant, non-contributing, and diversions to form a drainage area with single or multiple outlet points. Hydrologic units are only synonymous with classic watersheds when their boundaries include all the source area contributing surface water to a single defined outlet point.\"", "attribution": "Iowa Department of Natural Resources", "attribution_link": "https://geodata.iowa.gov/dataset/watershed-boundary-dataset", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-05-17T19:20:29.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-02-26T16:27:09.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-05-17T19:19:50.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-05-17T19:20:29.000Z", "columns_name": ["Watershed Name", "HUC 10", "HUC 12", "HUC 08", "Subwatershed Name", "Acres", "Boundary"], "columns_field_name": ["hu_10_name", "huc_10", "huc_12", "huc_8", "hu_12_name", "acres", "the_geom"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "MultiPolygon"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-02-26T16:35:51.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Physical Geography", "domain_tags": ["drainage", "huc12", "hydrologic units", "watershed", "watershed boundaries", "watersheds"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Data-Use_Terms-of-Use", "value": "See license."}, {"key": "Data-Coverage_Location", "value": "Iowa"}, {"key": "Data-Management_Updates", "value": "Open"}, {"key": "Data-Management_Publishing-Notes", "value": "Updated Irregularly"}, {"key": "Data-Management_Publishing-Agency", "value": "Natural Resources, Department of"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "mydata.iowa.gov", "license": "Creative Commons 1.0 Universal (Public Domain Dedication)"}, "permalink": "https://mydata.iowa.gov/d/iqbz-d3re", "link": "https://mydata.iowa.gov/Physical-Geography/Iowa-Watershed-Boundaries-Subwatersheds-HUC-12-/iqbz-d3re", "owner": {"id": "mfwc-umq4", "user_type": "team", "display_name": "Enterprise Data Admins"}, "creator": {"id": "mfwc-umq4", "user_type": "team", "display_name": "Enterprise Data Admins"}}

At a minimum, the WBD is being delineated and georeferenced to the USGS 1:24,000 scale topographic base map meeting National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS).

A hydrologic unit can accept surface water directly from upstream drainage areas, and indirectly from associated surface areas such as remnant, non-contributing, and diversions to form a drainage area with single or multiple outlet points.

Annual data is available beginning in 1997, and quarterly beginning 2005.  The data include breakdowns of industries' contributions.  Quarterly estimates are presented as an annual rate.\n\nGross domestic product (GDP) is the measure of the market value of all final goods and services produced within Iowa in a particular period of time. In concept, an industry's GDP by state, referred to as its \"value added\", is equivalent to its gross output (sales or receipts and other operating income, commodity taxes, and inventory change) minus its intermediate inputs (consumption of goods and services purchased from other U.S. industries or imported). The Iowa GDP a state counterpart to the Nation's GDP, the Bureau's featured and most comprehensive measure of U.S. economic activity. Iowa GDP differs from national GDP for the following reasons: Iowa GDP excludes and national GDP includes the compensation of federal civilian and military personnel stationed abroad and government consumption of fixed capital for military structures located abroad and for military equipment, except office equipment; and Iowa GDP and national GDP have different revision schedules.

Workshare provides a portion of a weekly unemployment compensation payment to certain individuals whose workweeks have been reduced. The program cushions the adverse effect of the reduction in business activity on workers and ensures that these workers will be available to resume prior employment levels when business demand increases. Workshare is different than regular Unemployment Insurance. In situations where there is a reduced number of work hours but the individual may not qualify for regular UI benefits due to the hours worked and wages earned, Workshare offers another potential option for partial wage replacement. Workshare equivalent claims are adjusted based on the proportion of the week being claimed.

Waterbodies in Iowa each have specific designations based on what they are commonly used for-recreation, such as swimming or fishing; drinking water; or maintaining a healthy population of fish and other aquatic life. Every two years, Iowa must report on its progress in meeting water quality goals to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The state prepares one report called the 305(b) Water Quality Assessment or 305(b) list. This 305(b) list categorizes waterbodies to reflect: those that meet all the designated uses (category 1), those in which data availability is insufficient to determine whether any or all designated uses are being met (categories 2 and 3), and those waters in which the water quality prevents it from fully meeting its designated use, and is thus considered \"impaired\". New impairments (or category 5 listings) are placed on the \"303(d) Impaired Waters Report\", commonly referred to as the \"impaired waters list.\" This is named after section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act and means that the stream or lake needs a water quality improvement plan written (also known by a technical name, \"Total Maximum Daily Load,\" or \"TMDL\"). The water quality improvement plan outlines water quality problems, identifies sources of the problem(s), identifies needed reductions in pollutants and offers possible solutions.
