Detailed information about the specific coding strategy is available in Comparative Effectiveness Review [CER] No. 207, Psychological and Pharmacological Treatments for Adults with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. (See our \"Risk of Bias\" data story.) \n\nMost domains were rated as Yes (i.e., minimal risk of bias), No (i.e., high risk of bias) or Unclear (i.e., bias could not be determined). The overall study rating is based on the domains and is coded as low, medium or high risk of bias. The 4 domains that were included as components of the overall rating include: Selection bias--randomization adequate, allocation concealment adequate, groups similar at baseline and whether they used intention to treat analyses; Performance bias--care providers masked and patients masked; Detection bias--outcome assessors masked; Attrition bias--overall attrition less than or equal to 20% vs over 20%; differential attrition less than or equal to 15% vs over 15%.\n\nAdditional items assessed (but not considered as part of the overall rating) include: Reporting bias--all prespecified outcomes reported; Reporting bias--method for handling dropouts; Outcome measures equal valid and reliable; Study reports adequate treatment fidelity based on measurements by independent raters.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "ncptsd@va.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2021-11-29T20:05:56.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-06-18T19:03:31.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2021-11-29T20:05:56.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2021-08-12T00:59:52.000Z", "columns_name": ["Female Percent Detail (Study level)", "Female Percent (Study level)", "Military Status (Study level)", "EPC Assessing Risk of Bias", "Risk of Bias Rating", "Outcome Measures Equal Valid and Reliable", "Additional Quantitative Data Reported", "Attrition Differential Less Than or Equal to 15%", "Attrition Overall Less Than or Equal to 20%", "Detection Bias: Outcome Assessors Masked", "Selection Bias: ITT Analysis", "Selection Bias: Groups Similar at Baseline", "Selection Bias: Randomization Adequate", "Treatment Focus", "Study ID", "Year Added to PTSD-Repository", "Citation", "Performance Bias: Care Providers Masked", "Trauma Detail (Study level)", "Trauma Type (Study level)", "Veteran Percent (Study level)", "Active Duty Military (Study level)", "Study Reports Adequate Treatment Fidelity Based on Measurements by Independent Raters", "Reporting Bias: All Prespecified Outcomes Reported", "Attrition Differential Greater Than 15%", "Attrition Overall Greater Than 20%", "Performance Bias: Patients Masked", "Study Class", "Community Percent (Study level)", "Reporting Bias: Detail of Other Methods of Handling Dropouts", "Reporting Bias: Method of Handling Dropouts", "Selection Bias: Allocation Concealment Adequate", "Total N Randomized (Study level)", "PTSDPubs ID", "Male Percent (Study level)"], "columns_field_name": ["female_percent_detail", "female_percent", "military_status", "epc_assessing_risk_of_bias", "risk_of_bias_rating", "outcome_measures_equal_valid", "additional_quantitative_data", "attrition_differential_less", "attrition_overall_less_than", "detection_bias_outcome", "selection_bias_itt_analysis", "selection_bias_groups_similar", "selection_bias_randomization", "treatment_focus", "study_id", "year_added_to_ptsd_repository", "citation", "performance_bias_care", "trauma_detail", "trauma_type", "veteran", "active_duty_military", "study_reports_adequate", "reporting_bias_all", "attrition_differential_greater", "attrition_overall_greater", "performance_bias_patients", "study_class", "community", "reporting_bias_detail_of", "reporting_bias_method_of", "selection_bias_allocation", "total_n_randomized", "ptsdpubs_id", "male_percent"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["At the study level, qualitative values reported in \"Female, percent\".
