Study arm treatment category variables are as follows: Pharmacotherapy (as well as a subclass such as antidepressant, antianxiety, etc.); Psychotherapy (as well as a subclass to identify trauma-focused or non-trauma-focused therapy); Complementary and Integrative Health (CIH; as well as a subclass such as relaxation or meditation); Nonpharmacologic Biological; Nonpharmacologic Cognitive; Collaborative Care; Other Treatments; Control\n\nThe Study Intervention dataset also includes information on the format of the treatment (individual, group, couples, mixed); treatment delivery method (in person, by phone, by video, technology alone, technology assisted, written or mixed); dose or amount of treatment and, treatment completion and adherence.

PTSD baseline mean score and standard deviation are provided as well as the within-treatment change from baseline. Within-group effect size is also included. The percent of participants who achieve loss of PTSD diagnosis and the percent who achieve clinically meaningful response are included for studies that reported these outcomes.\nUse this dataset to learn about changes in PTSD within a specific treatment. For example, what is the change in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale score across all study arms of a specific treatment type? From the visualization, you can filter by PTSD measure of interest and type of treatment.\n\nValues abstracted as not applicable (\"NA\") or not reported (\"NR\") by the study are null values (empty
