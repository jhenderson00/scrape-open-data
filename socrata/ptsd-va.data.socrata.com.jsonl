Descriptive information is provided on which measure was used, the statistical approach to measuring change in PTSD, how PTSD was defined and the definitions of loss of diagnosis and clinically meaningful change, if these variables were included in the study.\n\nResults in this dataset are provided for each treatment arm, and do not include comparisons across the arms (which can be found in the PTSD Outcome Comparisons Between Treatment Arms dataset described below). PTSD baseline mean score and standard deviation are provided as well as the within-treatment change from baseline. Within-group effect size is also included. The percent of participants who achieve loss of PTSD diagnosis and the percent who achieve clinically meaningful response are included for studies that reported these outcomes.\nUse this dataset to learn about changes in PTSD within a specific treatment. For example, what is the change in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale score across all study arms of a specific treatment type? From the visualization, you can filter by PTSD measure of interest and type of treatment.\n\nValues abstracted as not applicable (\"NA\") or not reported (\"NR\") by the study are null values (empty
