These are derived from reports with facility-level granularity across three main sources: (1) HHS TeleTracking, (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities and (3) National Healthcare Safety Network (before July 15).\n<br><br>\nThe file will be updated regularly and provides the latest values reported by each facility within the last four days for all time. This allows for a more comprehensive picture of the hospital utilization within a state by ensuring a hospital is represented, even if they miss a single day of reporting.\n<br><br>\nNo statistical analysis is applied to account for non-response and/or to account for missing data.\n<br><br>\nThe below table displays one value for each field (i.e., column). Sometimes, reports for a given facility will be provided to more than one reporting source: HHS TeleTracking, NHSN, and HHS Protect.

Data voluntarily reported to NHSN after May 1, 2024, will be available starting May 10, 2024, at <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#hospitalizations-landing\">COVID Data Tracker Hospitalizations</a>.</b></p>\n\nThe following dataset provides facility-level data for hospital utilization aggregated on a weekly basis (Sunday to Saturday). These are derived from reports with facility-level granularity across two main sources: (1) HHS TeleTracking, and (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities.\n\nThe hospital population includes all hospitals registered with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as of June 1, 2020. It includes non-CMS hospitals that have reported since July 15, 2020. It does not include psychiatric, rehabilitation, Indian Health Service (IHS) facilities, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities, Defense Health Agency (DHA) facilities, and religious non-medical facilities.\n\nFor a given entry, the term \u201ccollection_week\u201d signifies the start of the period that is aggregated. For example, a \u201ccollection_week\u201d of 2020-11-15 means the average/sum/coverage of the elements captured from that given facility starting and including Sunday, November 15, 2020, and ending and including reports for Saturday, November 21, 2020.\n\nReported elements include an append of either \u201c_coverage\u201d, \u201c_sum\u201d, or \u201c_avg\u201d.\n\n<ul><li>A \u201c_coverage\u201d append denotes how many times the facility reported that element during that collection week.</li>\n<li>A \u201c_sum\u201d append denotes the sum of the reports provided for that facility for that element during that collection week.</li>\n<li>A \u201c_avg\u201d append is the average of the reports provided for that facility for that element during that collection week.</li></ul>\n\nThe file will be updated weekly. No statistical analysis is applied to impute non-response. For averages, calculations are based on the number of values collected for a given hospital in that collection week. Suppression is applied to the file for sums and averages less than four (4). In these cases, the field will be replaced with \u201c-999,999\u201d. \n\n<b> A story page was created to display both corrected and raw datasets and can be accessed at this link: https://healthdata.gov/stories/s/nhgk-5gpv </b>\n\nThis data is preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. Data is available starting on July 31, 2020.\n\nSometimes, reports for a given facility will be provided to both HHS TeleTracking and HHS Protect. When this occurs, to ensure that there are not duplicate reports, deduplication is applied according to prioritization rules within HHS Protect.\n\nFor influenza fields listed in the file, the current HHS guidance marks these fields as optional.

It does not include psychiatric, rehabilitation, Indian Health Service (IHS) facilities, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities, Defense Health Agency (DHA) facilities, and religious non-medical facilities.\n\nFor a given entry, the term \u201ccollection_week\u201d signifies the start of the period that is aggregated. For example, a \u201ccollection_week\u201d of 2020-11-15 means the average/sum/coverage of the elements captured from that given facility starting and including Sunday, November 15, 2020, and ending and including reports for Saturday, November 21, 2020.\n\nReported elements include an append of either \u201c_coverage\u201d, \u201c_sum\u201d, or \u201c_avg\u201d.\n\n<ul><li>A \u201c_coverage\u201d append denotes how many times the facility reported that element during that collection week.</li>\n<li>A \u201c_sum\u201d append denotes the sum of the reports provided for that facility for that element during that collection week.</li>\n<li>A \u201c_avg\u201d append is the average of the reports provided for that facility for that element during that collection week.</li></ul>\n\nThe file will be updated weekly. No statistical analysis is applied to impute non-response. For averages, calculations are based on the number of values collected for a given hospital in that collection week. Suppression is applied to the file for sums and averages less than four (4). In these cases, the field will be replaced with \u201c-999,999\u201d. \n\n<b> A story page was created to display both corrected and raw datasets and can be accessed at this link: https://healthdata.gov/stories/s/nhgk-5gpv </b>\n\nThis data is preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. Data is available starting on July 31, 2020.\n\nSometimes, reports for a given facility will be provided to both HHS TeleTracking and HHS Protect. When this occurs, to ensure that there are not duplicate reports, deduplication is applied according to prioritization rules within HHS Protect.\n\nFor influenza fields listed in the file, the current HHS guidance marks these fields as optional. As a result, coverage of these elements are varied.\n\n<b>For recent updates to the dataset, scroll to the bottom of the dataset description.</b>\n\nOn May 3, 2021, the following fields have been

These are derived from reports with facility-level granularity across three main sources: (1) HHS TeleTracking, (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities and (3) National Healthcare Safety Network (before July 15).\n<br><br>\nThe file will be updated regularly and provides the latest values reported by each facility within the last four days for all time. This allows for a more comprehensive picture of the hospital utilization within a state by ensuring a hospital is represented, even if they miss a single day of reporting.\n<br><br>\nNo statistical analysis is applied to account for non-response and/or to account for missing data.\n<br><br>\nThe below table displays one value for each field (i.e., column).

The purpose of the Adoption Call to Action is to engage child welfare agencies to improve the timeliness and likelihood of permanency for children who are waiting for adoption. Fifty-three jurisdictions are participating with each receiving technical assistance support from the Capacity Building Center for States, a Children\u2019s Bureau funded provider. Each jurisdiction is involved in developing and implementing innovative solutions to achieve the goals established for this initiative. Lessons learned from this data collection will not only provide an assessment of the overall effectiveness of this initiative but will inform similar efforts in the future. This new information collection will provide the Children\u2019s Bureau with an understanding of agency target populations, specific strategies (interventions), and outcomes measurement, in order to inform technical assistance strategies and provide a national picture of the overall success of the initiative. Baseline data will be collected with an initial survey (Baseline Survey), with two follow-up survey instruments (Progress Update Survey) designed to collect process and outcome measures at two additional points in time. The instruments focus on (1) identifying the target population(s) agencies are addressing, (2) understanding elements of intervention implementation (process measures), and (3) capturing information related to the outcomes of these efforts. Respondents of these data collection instruments will include one representative from each of the 53 child welfare agencies who are participating in Adoption Call to Action activities. Respondents will be able to use their own responses to this data collection to support their jurisdiction\u2019s efforts to document and monitor progress and to communicate with stakeholders. Aggregate reporting will be developed from this data collection at each of the three points of data collection to provide TA providers and the Children\u2019s Bureau with progress updates that can be used to developed more effective and tailored approaches to assistance.\n\n<b>Units of Response: </b>Child Welfare Agencies\n\n<b>Type of Data: </b>Survey\n\n<b>Tribal Data: </b>Unavailable\n\n<b>COVID-19 Data: </b>Unavailable\n\n<b>Periodicity: </b>Irregular\n\n<b>SORN: </b>Not Applicable\n\n<b>Data Use Agreement: </b>Unavailable\n\n<b>Data Use Agreement Location: </b>Unavailable\n\n<b>Equity Indicators: </b>Unavailable\n\n<b>Granularity: </b>Unavailable\n\n<b>Spatial: </b>United States\n\n<b>Geocoding: </b>Unavailable", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "Unavailable", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-11-29T17:23:00.000Z", "createdAt": "2023-11-17T16:32:53.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-11-29T17:23:00.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-11-17T16:32:53.000Z", "columns_name": [], "columns_field_name": [], "columns_datatype": [], "columns_description": [], "columns_format": [], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "locked": false, "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2023-11-17T16:33:07.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "ACF", "domain_tags": ["foster care and adoption", "research and evaluation"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Archive_Archive-Repository", "value": "https://healthdata.gov/d/fh97-qy79"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Email", "value": "Unavailable"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "Unavailable"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Public-Access-Level", "value": "public"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "ACF"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Homepage", "value": "https://icfinternational.iad1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_esQPJ4cqPuhOuKa?Q_CHL=si"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "009:70"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Name", "value": "Unavailable"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "healthdata.gov"}, "permalink": "https://healthdata.gov/d/sm22-7pf7", "link": "https://healthdata.gov/ACF/Child-Welfare-Information-Gateway-Survey/sm22-7pf7", "owner": {"id": "rpdh-ikjt", "user_type": "team", "display_name": "Administration for Children and Families"}, "creator": {"id": "rpdh-ikjt", "user_type": "team", "display_name": "Administration for Children and Families"}}
