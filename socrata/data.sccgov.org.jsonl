Geographic Extent: Santa Clara county, California, covering approximately 1771 square miles. Dataset Description: The lidar project called for the Planning, Acquisition, processing and derivative products of lidar data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.35 meters. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base Lidar Specification, Version 2.1. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83 (2011), State Plane, Feet and vertical datum of NAVD88 (GEOID18), Feet. Lidar data was delivered as processed Classified LAS 1.4 files, formatted to 8185 individual 2500 ft x 2500 ft tiles, as tiled intensity rasters, and as tiled bare-earth DEMs; all tiled to the same 2500 ft x 2500 ft schema. Ground Conditions: Lidar was collected in early 2020, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the lidar data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Sanborn Map Company, Inc., utilized a total of 25 ground control points that were used to calibrate the lidar to known ground locations established throughout the project area. An additional 125 independent accuracy checkpoints, 70 in Bare Earth and Urban landcovers (70 NVA points), 55 in Tall Grass and Brushland/Low Trees categories (55 VVA points), were used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data. These check points were not used to calibrate or post process the data.", "attribution": "Santa Clara County", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-02-22T23:13:35.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-01-21T16:32:33.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-02-22T23:13:35.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-01-21T16:41:34.000Z", "columns_name": ["Shape_Length_StatePlane", "Building_H", "OBJECTID", "the_geom", "Class", "Shape.STArea()", "Shape_Area_StatePlane", "Shape.STLength()", "Base_Heigh", "Shape_Leng"], "columns_field_name": ["shape_length_stateplane", "building_h", "objectid", "the_geom", "class", "shape_starea", "shape_area_stateplane", "shape_stlength", "base_heigh", "shape_leng"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "MultiPolygon", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-01-21T16:32:34.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Housing & Development", "domain_tags": ["2dfootprints", "buildings", "lidar", "sccmap"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.sccgov.org"}, "permalink": "https://data.sccgov.org/d/wrkr-gfvf", "link": "https://data.sccgov.org/Housing-Development/Buildings-Footprints-2D/wrkr-gfvf", "owner": {"id": "inws-vnhj", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "GIS"}, "creator": {"id": "inws-vnhj", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "GIS"}}
