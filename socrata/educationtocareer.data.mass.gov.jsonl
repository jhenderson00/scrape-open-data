For more information about these pathways and programs, visit the <a href=\"https://www.doe.mass.edu/ccte/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Office of College, Career, and Technical Education website</a>.\n\nThis dataset contains student enrollment data for all public and charter schools and districts since 2022. It is a wide file with three groups of columns representing the following enrollment indicators:<ul><li>Number of students in CTE programs, Early College, and Innovation Pathways by grade, including grades 9-12 and special education beyond grade 12 (SP)</li><li>Percent of students in CTE programs, Early College, and Innovation Pathways by race and gender</li><li>Number and percent of students in CTE programs, Early College, and Innovation Pathways in student groups: First Language Not English, English Learners, Students with Disabilities, High Needs, Low Income, and Economically Disadvantaged</li></ul>Economically Disadvantaged was used 2015-2021.
