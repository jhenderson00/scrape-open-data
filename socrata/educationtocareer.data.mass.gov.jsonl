For more information, please view the <a href=\"https://profiles.doe.mass.edu/help/data.aspx?section=students#indicators\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Profiles Help - About the Data</a> page.\n\nMassachusetts defines chronically absent as missing at least 10 percent of days enrolled (for instance, 18 days absent if enrolled for a typical school year of 180 days), regardless of the reason for the absence. Being chronically absent can have a significant impact on a student's academic progress and their ability to access the variety of academic and non-academic supports that schools provide.\n\nChronic absenteeism grew during the COVID-19 pandemic and, as of the 2022-23 school year, had not returned to pre-pandemic rates.
