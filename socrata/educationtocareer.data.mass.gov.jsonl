Approximately 85-90% of students in each Graduation Year were found in the wage record system which does NOT include employment outside of Massachusetts, federal employment, or self-employment. DUA does not collect information regarding hours worked, hourly rate, or Standard Occupational Classification (specific job type).\n\nPostsecondary enrollment information is obtained from the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC). Institutions reporting enrollment information covers approximately 97% of college students nationwide.\n\nNOTE: \"Number Employed\" refers to the total number of students found in wage records, and NOT found in postsecondary enrollment records.\n\nSuppression:\nAverage earnings are not reported for counts of fewer than 6.\nSuppression is applied under the following conditions:\n- If the HS Graduate Count of the student group is less than 6.\n- If the Employment Count of a student group during any Earnings Year is less than 6.\n- If the Employment Count of a student group is 1 during any Earnings Year, that student group and the student group with the next lowest Employment Count within that student group category is suppressed.\n- Suppressed values are displayed as blanks.\n- Totals are based on calendar years for which a full year of wage data are available.\n\nThis dataset also contains the same data that is also published in the Employment and Earnings of High School Graduates dashboard:\n<a href=\"https://app.powerbigov.us/view?r=eyJrIjoiODA3NDU1NWMtOTJiMS00YTZiLTg1MmEtN2JhOTM4ZjNmNWExIiwidCI6IjNlODYxZDE2LTQ4YjctNGEwZS05ODA2LThjMDRkODFiN2IyYSJ9&pageName=ReportSection8a7bba65c004c865b65b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Wage Dashboard\n</a>", "attribution": "Executive Office of Education", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-11-20T21:27:12.000Z", "createdAt": "2023-06-02T20:03:25.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-11-20T21:27:12.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-07-13T20:50:01.000Z", "columns_name": ["EMP_CNT", "EARNINGS_YEAR", "GRAD_CNT", "DIST_CODE", "NAICS_CODE", "NAICS_DESC", "AVG_EARNINGS", "DIST_NAME", "HS_GRAD_YEAR"], "columns_field_name": ["employed_count", "earnings_year", "grad_count", "district_code", "naics_code", "naics_description", "average_earnings", "district_name", "hs_grad_year"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Employed Count", "Earnings Year", "Graduated Count", "District Code", "North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code", "North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Description", "Average Earnings", "District Name", "High School Graduation Year"], "columns_format": [{"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "noCommas": "true", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {}, {"precision": "0", "decimalSeparator": ".", "currencyStyle": "USD", "groupSeparator": ",", "precisionStyle": "currency"}, {}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "noCommas": "true", "groupSeparator": ","}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2023-06-16T20:33:20.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Finance and Budget", "domain_tags": ["earnings", "finance", "income", "industry", "wage"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Update_Update-Frequency", "value": "Biannually"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "educationtocareer.data.mass.gov"}, "permalink": "https://educationtocareer.data.mass.gov/d/wxc8-6an4", "link": "https://educationtocareer.data.mass.gov/Finance-and-Budget/Wage-Dashboard-Average-Annual-Earnings-by-Industry/wxc8-6an4", "owner": {"id": "m5tk-n3hd", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "E2C Hub"}, "creator": {"id": "m5tk-n3hd", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "E2C Hub"}}
