This program has been taking place each year since 2010. \n\nCounts are collected Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday for one hour in the morning and evening using a \u201cscreen line\u201d method, whereby cyclists and pedestrians are counted as they pass by an imaginary line across the street and sidewalks. Morning count sessions begin between 7:15 and 7:45 am, and evening count sessions begin between 4:45 and 5:15 pm.  \n\nBike counts capture the number of people riding bicycles, so an adult and child riding on the same bike would be counted as two counts even though it is only one bike. Pedestrian counts capture people walking or jogging, people using a wheelchair or assistive device, children in strollers, and people using other micro-mobility devices, such as skateboards, scooters, or roller skates. \n\nWhile the City and its amazing volunteers do their best to collect accurate and complete data each year and the City does quality control to catch clear errors, it is not possible to ensure 100% accuracy of the data and not all locations have been counted every year of the program. There are also several external factors impacting counts that are not consistent year-to-year, such as nearby construction and weather. For these reasons, the counts are intended to be used to observe high-level trends across the city and at count locations, and not to extrapolate that biking and walking in Somerville has changed by a specific percentage or number.\n\n Data in this dataset are available at the location count level.
