Reporting month refers to the time period when the consumer activity took place and is a representation of economic activity in the city.

Revenues by reporting month change as audits, collections and other taxpayer payments/refunds are processed or other corrections to previous periods are received. These updates to revenues are reported to the month for which the taxable activity occurred.
