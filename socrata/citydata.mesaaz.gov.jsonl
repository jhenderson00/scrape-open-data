Direct counts in those areas are then extrapolated to estimate the number of individuals experiencing homelessness in unsheltered situations within the City of Phoenix geographic boundaries.", "attribution": "Community Services", "attribution_link": "http://azmag.gov/Committees/Policy-Committees/Maricopa-Regional-Continuum-of-Care-Board", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-05-03T20:38:35.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-12-06T21:30:25.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-05-03T20:38:35.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2018-12-06T21:44:35.000Z", "columns_name": ["Count", "Year", "Municipality"], "columns_field_name": ["count", "year", "municipality"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Number of individuals found to be unsheltered either by direct count or extrapolation", "Year when count took place", "Name of city where count took place"], "columns_format": [{}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-12-06T21:44:36.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["social services", "demographics", "housing & development"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Community Services", "domain_tags": ["count", "homeless", "in", "point", "time"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Public-Access_Public-Access-Level", "value": "Public"}, {"key": "Terms-of-Use_Terms-of-Use", "value": "https://data.mesaaz.gov/stories/s/2dcd-j2nx/"}, {"key": "Data-Steward_Data-Steward", "value": "Aaron Raine"}, {"key": "Frequency_Publishing", "value": "Annual"}, {"key": "Frequency_Data-Change", "value": "Annual"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "citydata.mesaaz.gov", "license": "See Terms of Use"}, "permalink": "https://citydata.mesaaz.gov/d/qhak-epdf", "link": "https://citydata.mesaaz.gov/Community-Services/Unsheltered-Point-in-Time-PIT-Count-2014-2018/qhak-epdf", "owner": {"id": "pxyu-mdaq", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "City of Mesa"}, "creator": {"id": "pxyu-mdaq", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "City of Mesa"}}
