For example, May revenues are generally posted by mid July.  \n\nThis dataset contains sales tax revenue for taxpayers within the City of Mesa by reporting month. Reporting month refers to the time period when the consumer activity took place and is a representation of economic activity in the city. For example, a sale registered in the month of March, appears in the reporting month March, regardless of when the payment was actually received/posted by the City. Revenues by reporting month change as audits, collections and other taxpayer payments/refunds are processed or other corrections to previous periods are received. These updates to revenues are reported to the month for which the taxable activity occurred. For these reasons, generally speaking, reporting month revenues become a more accurate reflection of consumer activity over time. For sales tax revenues reflecting posting month (accounting period when the tax revenues were posted), see \"Citywide Tax Revenue by Post Month\" at https://data.mesaaz.gov/Financials/Citywide-Tax-Revenue-by-Post-Month/e9zg-r4w9.

Posting month is the accounting period the City booked the revenues and is used for financial reporting and budgeting purposes.

If after combining there are still less than 10 taxpayers then the category is excluded and associated revenues are posted as \"Other\". Transient Lodging Tax (TLT) revenues are NOT included in this dataset because there are too few taxpayers in the downtown area to report. For sales tax revenues reflecting consumer activity periods (period when the taxes where collected by businesses), see \"Downtown Tax Revenue by Report Month\" at https://data.mesaaz.gov/Financials/Downtown-Tax-Revenue-by-Report-Month/258t-7i6w.
