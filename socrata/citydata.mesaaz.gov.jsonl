Reporting month refers to the time period when the consumer activity took place and is a representation of economic activity in the city.

Revenues by reporting month change as audits, collections and other taxpayer payments/refunds are processed or other corrections to previous periods are received. These updates to revenues are reported to the month for which the taxable activity occurred.

The average charges for the current fiscal year for various cities are compared with the average costs for the current fiscal year in the City of\r\nMesa. While some neighboring municipalities have a different resource mix than Mesa, bringing them all together allows for comparison to ensure that Mesa remains an affordable place to live, work and play. Sources include applicable Tax Year Limited Property Value, Maricopa County Assessor's Office, and Maricopa County Tax Levy and Rates page. \r\nThe Average Homeowner\u2019s Annual Cost Comparison Notes:\r\n\u2022 The City of Mesa and the Town of Gilbert are the only municipalities that do not have a primary\r\nproperty tax. All other revenue sources exist in all municipalities.\r\n\u2022 Estimated city sales taxes paid is based on average household expenditures from the Bureau of Labor\r\nand Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey applied to each city\u2019s sales tax rate. Some cities have\r\ndifferent rates for different taxable items. Mesa does not collect sales tax on the sale of food for\r\nconsumption at home.\r\n\u2022 Comparisons are determined using a standard service level for all cities.\r\n\u2022 Standard solid waste charges are for twice per week garbage (and recyclables where applicable)\r\ncollection using 90 gallon barrels. Solid Waste residential charges include a Green and Clean fee for\r\nMesa.\r\n\u2022 Other city\u2019s environmental fees are included as applicable.\r\n\u2022 Charges are based on FY 16/17 annual average usage of 8,900 water gallons per month, ranging from\r\n6,000 in winter to 12,000 in summer.\r\n\u2022 Wastewater charges are based on the average consumption of water during the winter months.\r\nSEE ATTACHMENT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION", "attribution": "Office of Management and Budget", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-04-06T16:06:47.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-05-03T23:26:57.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-04-06T16:06:47.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2018-05-07T23:03:22.000Z", "columns_name": ["Comparison Value", "Fiscal Year", "Comparison Item", "City"], "columns_field_name": ["comparison_value", "fiscal_year", "comparison_item", "city"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Annual dollar amount or tax rate", "The fiscal year starts July 1 of the first year and ends June 30th of the next.
