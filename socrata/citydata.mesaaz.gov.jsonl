Posting month is the accounting period the City booked the revenues and is used for financial reporting and budgeting purposes.

Because of taxpayer confidentiality guidelines, a category or business class with fewer than 10 taxpayers is combined with a similar taxpayer category. If after combining there are still less than 10 taxpayers then the category is excluded and associated revenues are posted as \"Other\". Transient Lodging Tax (TLT) revenues are NOT included in this dataset because there are too few taxpayers in the downtown area to report. For sales tax revenues reflecting consumer activity periods (period when the taxes where collected by businesses), see \"Downtown Tax Revenue by Report Month\" at https://data.mesaaz.gov/Financials/Downtown-Tax-Revenue-by-Report-Month/258t-7i6w.
