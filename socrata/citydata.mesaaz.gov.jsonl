{"resource": {"name": "Crime Reporting Statistics", "id": "37q9-d27y", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "***In January 2020, as part of implementing a new citywide police incident reporting system the City began moving away from reporting crime to the FBI Unified Crime Reporting (UCR) Program and instead to the new National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) format. For this reason, 2020 UCR data may have inconsistencies and/or inaccuracies. A filtered view of UCR data is available for 2011-2019 at https://citydata.mesaaz.gov/Police/Crime-Reporting-Statistics-Uniform-Crime-Reporting/bfen-qa5d\n\nAs of January 1, 2021, the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) became the national crime data collection program. NIBRS was implemented to improve the overall quality of crime data collected by law enforcement, by capturing details on each single crime incident, as well as on separate offenses within the same incident. The historic Summary Reporting System (SRS) data collection, which collects more limited information than the more robust NIBRS, was phased out to make Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) a NIBRS-only data collection.\n\nComing soon, look for a new dataset based on NIBRS, which will provide more complete and comprehensive data for law enforcement, researchers, and the public.\n\nThe Uniform Crime Reporting Program collects statistics on the number of offenses known to City of Mesa Police Department. Address and Location data are not exact location of incidents and have been rounded to nearest hundred block. Lat/Long are approximations only based on rounded hundred block. Part 1 offenses are reported monthly and are chosen by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) because they are serious crimes, they occur with regularity in all areas of the country, and they are likely to be reported to police. Part I offenses are defined as: Criminal homicide, Forcible Rape, Robbery, Aggravated Assault, Burglary (breaking or entering), Larceny-theft (except motor vehicle theft), Motor vehicle theft and Arson.", "attribution": "Police", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-07-28T20:32:28.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-01-26T00:26:08.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-07-28T20:32:28.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2021-01-27T17:40:29.000Z", "columns_name": ["RowID", "Zip", "Latitude", "Street Type", "Street Name", "Address", "Occurred Date", "Report Month", "Report Date", "City", "Street Number", "Crime ID", "Longitude", "Location 1 (address)", "Location 1", "Report Year", "Crime Type", "Street Direction", "Location 1 (zip)", "Location 1 (state)", "Location 1 (city)"], "columns_field_name": ["rowid", "zip", "latitude", "street_type", "street_name", "address", "occurred_date", "report_month", "report_date", "city", "street_number", "crime_id", "longitude", "location_1_address", "location_1", "report_year", "crime_type", "street_direction", "location_1_zip", "location_1_state", "location_1_city"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Point", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Unique identifier for each row of the dataset", "Zip Code where the incident occurred", "Latitude based on the rounded hundred block.

For example, May revenues are generally posted by mid July.  \n\nThis dataset contains sales tax revenue for taxpayers within the City of Mesa by reporting month. Reporting month refers to the time period when the consumer activity took place and is a representation of economic activity in the city. For example, a sale registered in the month of March, appears in the reporting month March, regardless of when the payment was actually received/posted by the City. Revenues by reporting month change as audits, collections and other taxpayer payments/refunds are processed or other corrections to previous periods are received. These updates to revenues are reported to the month for which the taxable activity occurred. For these reasons, generally speaking, reporting month revenues become a more accurate reflection of consumer activity over time. For sales tax revenues reflecting posting month (accounting period when the tax revenues were posted), see \"Citywide Tax Revenue by Post Month\" at https://data.mesaaz.gov/Financials/Citywide-Tax-Revenue-by-Post-Month/e9zg-r4w9. Sales tax revenue includes Transaction Privilege Tax (TPT) and Transient Lodging Tax (TLT).
