For example, May revenues are generally posted by mid July.  \n\nThis dataset contains sales tax revenue for taxpayers within the City of Mesa by reporting month. Reporting month refers to the time period when the consumer activity took place and is a representation of economic activity in the city. For example, a sale registered in the month of March, appears in the reporting month March, regardless of when the payment was actually received/posted by the City. Revenues by reporting month change as audits, collections and other taxpayer payments/refunds are processed or other corrections to previous periods are received. These updates to revenues are reported to the month for which the taxable activity occurred. For these reasons, generally speaking, reporting month revenues become a more accurate reflection of consumer activity over time. For sales tax revenues reflecting posting month (accounting period when the tax revenues were posted), see \"Citywide Tax Revenue by Post Month\" at https://data.mesaaz.gov/Financials/Citywide-Tax-Revenue-by-Post-Month/e9zg-r4w9.

A utility locate involves identification of all underground utilities prior to excavation in a specified area. A utility locate is initiated, usually by a homeowner or excavator, by calling 811 or contacting Arizona\u2019s 811 center\u2019s website and providing the address, county and nearest cross street of where they\u2019re planning to dig, as well as the type of project they\u2019re completing and the exact area on the property they\u2019re planning to dig. 811 then contacts the city\u2019s utilities so they can mark the presence of any underground utilities in the proposed project area. Utility locates can contribute to increased safety to people and property and can eliminate unexpected costs due to accidental damage of buried utilities.  A locate can be initiated by either a homeowner or an excavator.

Posting month is the accounting period the City booked the revenues and is used for financial reporting and budgeting purposes.

Because of taxpayer confidentiality guidelines, a category or business class with fewer than 10 taxpayers is combined with a similar taxpayer category. If after combining there are still less than 10 taxpayers then the category is excluded and associated revenues are posted as \"Other\". Transient Lodging Tax (TLT) revenues are NOT included in this dataset because there are too few taxpayers in the downtown area to report.
