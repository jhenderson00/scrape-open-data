Reporting month refers to the time period when the consumer activity took place and is a representation of economic activity in the city.

Revenues by reporting month change as audits, collections and other taxpayer payments/refunds are processed or other corrections to previous periods are received. These updates to revenues are reported to the month for which the taxable activity occurred.

Posting month is the accounting period the City booked the revenues and is used for financial reporting and budgeting purposes.

If after combining there are still less than 10 taxpayers then the category is excluded and associated revenues are posted as \"Other\". Transient Lodging Tax (TLT) revenues are NOT included in this dataset because there are too few taxpayers in the downtown area to report. For sales tax revenues reflecting consumer activity periods (period when the taxes where collected by businesses), see \"Downtown Tax Revenue by Report Month\" at https://data.mesaaz.gov/Financials/Downtown-Tax-Revenue-by-Report-Month/258t-7i6w.
