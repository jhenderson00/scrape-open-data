{"resource": {"name": "Citywide Tax Revenue by Report Month", "id": "8y5v-kwui", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "NOTE: Effective March 1, 2019, the Mesa tax rate increased from 1.75% to 2.0%.Period revenues are delayed by up to 120 days. For example, May revenues are generally posted by mid July.  \n\nThis dataset contains sales tax revenue for taxpayers within the City of Mesa by reporting month. Reporting month refers to the time period when the consumer activity took place and is a representation of economic activity in the city. For example, a sale registered in the month of March, appears in the reporting month March, regardless of when the payment was actually received/posted by the City. Revenues by reporting month change as audits, collections and other taxpayer payments/refunds are processed or other corrections to previous periods are received. These updates to revenues are reported to the month for which the taxable activity occurred. For these reasons, generally speaking, reporting month revenues become a more accurate reflection of consumer activity over time. For sales tax revenues reflecting posting month (accounting period when the tax revenues were posted), see \"Citywide Tax Revenue by Post Month\" at https://data.mesaaz.gov/Financials/Citywide-Tax-Revenue-by-Post-Month/e9zg-r4w9. Sales tax revenue includes Transaction Privilege Tax (TPT) and Transient Lodging Tax (TLT). Effective January 2017, the Arizona Department of Revenue administers sales and use tax collection for all state, county and municipal taxing jurisdictions.

Posting month is the accounting period the City booked the revenues and is used for financial reporting and budgeting purposes.
