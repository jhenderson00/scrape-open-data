Therefore,  several caveats are in order:  1.   The data appear exactly as reported by the taxpayer. No validations or error corrections were  performed by the Department. 2.   Likewise, the information represents the taxpayer\u2019s position on the return as filed and does  not reflect any adjustments made either during return processing or in the course of an audit. 3.   Reporting is limited to the entity earning credit as determined by the credit forms filed with  the tax return. 4.   The actual amount of credit claimed during the period covered by this report may exceed what  is reported here. This can occur if recipients of credit from pass-through entities file returns  claiming credit, but the entity has not yet filed a return. 5. Amounts do not necessarily represent finished projects. Some of these projects may be works-  in-progress. The clean-up components are available for 5 years and the property component is  available for 10 years. 6.   In the 2010, 2011, and 2012 tax years, taxpayers are required to defer amounts of credits used  and refunded that in the aggregate exceed $2 million. Excess brownfield credits deferred will be  available as follows: 50% of total deferred allowed in 2013; 75% of remaining credit allowed in  2014; all remaining credit allowed in 2015.  Data in the report are amounts computed prior to  deferral. 7.   No brownfield redevelopment credit submissions were received for calendar years 2005 and 2006.

Industries are classified according to their North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Monthly job estimates for areas below the state level are not adjusted for seasonal changes in employment. It is important to keep in mind that month-to-month changes may be due to regular seasonal patterns in an industry. Typically, during the winter holiday shopping season retail jobs increase, and during the summer there are more workers in the construction industry. On the other hand, changes may reflect new businesses, expansions, closings, etc. Comparison of monthly changes for the same period in prior years will provide a better understanding of whether the change is seasonal or atypical. Data adjusted for seasonal changes are only available for industry divisions at the state level. Monthly fluctuations in the wage and salary employment data are an essential part of the changes that occur in a dynamic economy of the county or region. It is important to study the data over time to evaluate the strength of the local economy. Wage and salary employment data identify which industries have the largest number of jobs. An industry with a large number of workers may not necessarily be expanding; it may even be downsizing. New and expanding industries may not have large numbers of existing jobs but are a good source for new job opportunities. Annual average data over time tend to be a better indicator of employment trends for the various industries in an area.

The four datasets display major income tax components by tax year. This includes the distribution of New York adjusted gross income and tax liability by county or place of residence, as well as the value of deductions, exemptions, taxable income and tax before credits by size of income. In addition, three of the four datasets include all the components of income, the components of deductions, and the addition/subtraction modifications.\r\nCaution: The current datasets are based on population data. For tax years prior to 2015, data were based on sample data. Data customers are advised to use caution when drawing conclusions comparing data for tax years prior to 2015 and subsequent tax years.

The liability amounts contained in these datasets do not reflect actual tax collections. Total tax collections are reported on a State fiscal basis (April 1 through March 31) and include receipts of various types of payments made to satisfy taxpayers\u2019 tax liability \u2013 including withholding, estimated payments, final payments, refunds, audit payments, and payments from delinquent accounts. Tax collections are reported in the Department\u2019s Fiscal Year Tax Collections reports, and not in these datasets. Caution: The current datasets are based on population data. For tax years prior to 2015, data were based on sample data. Data customers are advised to use caution when drawing conclusions comparing data for tax years prior to 2015 and subsequent tax years. Further details are included in the Overview.

Through RESRFP22-1, NYSERDA seeks to procure approximately 4.5 million Tier 1 eligible Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) from eligible facilities that enter commercial operation on or after January 1, 2015 and on or before November 30, 2024, unless extended to November 30, 2027.\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate the protection of agricultural lands, developers participating in RESRFP22-1 or the NY-Sun program may be responsible for making an agricultural mitigation payment to a designated fund based on the extent to which the solar project\u2019s facility area overlaps with an Agricultural District and New York\u2019s highly productive agricultural soils, identified as Mineral Soil Groups (MSG) classifications 1 through 4 (MSG 1-4). This mitigation approach is designed to discourage solar projects from siting on MSG 1-4.  Furthermore, this mitigation approach is designed to encourage retaining agricultural productivity on the project site.  Instances where Proposers cannot avoid or minimize impacts on MSG 1-4 will result in a payment to a fund administered by NYSERDA. Disbursement of collected agricultural mitigation payment funds will be informed by consultation with the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets (AGM) to support ongoing regional agricultural practices and/or soil conservation initiatives.\r\n\r\nThis dataset contains a combination of soils data from multiple sources to serve participants of NYSERDA\u2019s Large-Scale Renewable and NY-Sun programs. The NYSERDA 2022 Soils Data was created by converting the 2022 New York State Agricultural Land Classification master list of soils maintained by AGM to a tabular form and providing a corresponding unique identifier for each listed soil that enables the user to link the soils to the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) SSURGO soils database, allowing for a geographical representation.  When the NYSERDA 2022 Soils Data is joined with spatial data from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) SSURGO soils database, the corresponding soil unit can be mapped in a geographic information system software.  The latest version of the SSURGO database should be used to get the most accurate join.  Data is updated yearly from both NRCS and from AGM, however, NYSERDA will not update this dataset and it will remain intact for future reference. NYSERDA intends on creating new soils datasets for future procurements on an annual basis.\r\n\r\nThe New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) offers objective information and analysis, innovative programs, technical expertise, and support to help New Yorkers increase energy efficiency, save money, use renewable energy, and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

QCEW data encompass approximately 97 percent of New York's nonfarm employment, providing a virtual census of employees and their wages as well as the most complete universe of employment and wage data, by industry, at the State, regional and county levels. \"Covered\" employment refers broadly to both private-sector employees as well as state, county, and municipal government employees insured under the New York State Unemployment Insurance (UI) Act.

Employee categories not covered by UI include some agricultural workers, railroad workers, private household workers, student workers, the self-employed, and unpaid family workers. QCEW data are similar to monthly Current Employment Statistics (CES) data in that they reflect jobs by place of work; therefore, if a person holds two jobs, he or she is counted twice.

Therefore,  several caveats are in order:  1.   The data appear exactly as reported by the taxpayer. No validations or error corrections were  performed by the Department. 2.   Likewise, the information represents the taxpayer\u2019s position on the return as filed and does  not reflect any adjustments made either during return processing or in the course of an audit. 3.   Reporting is limited to the entity earning credit as determined by the credit forms filed with  the tax return. 4.   The actual amount of credit claimed during the period covered by this report may exceed what  is reported here. This can occur if recipients of credit from pass-through entities file returns  claiming credit, but the entity has not yet filed a return. 5. Amounts do not necessarily represent finished projects. Some of these projects may be works-  in-progress. The clean-up components are available for 5 years and the property component is  available for 10 years. 6.   In the 2010, 2011, and 2012 tax years, taxpayers are required to defer amounts of credits used  and refunded that in the aggregate exceed $2 million.
