Likewise, the information represents the taxpayer\u2019s position on the return as filed and does  not reflect any adjustments made either during return processing or in the course of an audit. 3.   Reporting is limited to the entity earning credit as determined by the credit forms filed with  the tax return. 4.   The actual amount of credit claimed during the period covered by this report may exceed what  is reported here. This can occur if recipients of credit from pass-through entities file returns  claiming credit, but the entity has not yet filed a return. 5. Amounts do not necessarily represent finished projects. Some of these projects may be works-  in-progress. The clean-up components are available for 5 years and the property component is  available for 10 years. 6.   In the 2010, 2011, and 2012 tax years, taxpayers are required to defer amounts of credits used  and refunded that in the aggregate exceed $2 million.

The employment figure is an estimate of the number of jobs in the area (regardless of the place of residence of the workers) rather than a count of jobs held by the residents of the area. Industries are classified according to their North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Monthly job estimates for areas below the state level are not adjusted for seasonal changes in employment. It is important to keep in mind that month-to-month changes may be due to regular seasonal patterns in an industry. Typically, during the winter holiday shopping season retail jobs increase, and during the summer there are more workers in the construction industry. On the other hand, changes may reflect new businesses, expansions, closings, etc. Comparison of monthly changes for the same period in prior years will provide a better understanding of whether the change is seasonal or atypical. Data adjusted for seasonal changes are only available for industry divisions at the state level. Monthly fluctuations in the wage and salary employment data are an essential part of the changes that occur in a dynamic economy of the county or region. It is important to study the data over time to evaluate the strength of the local economy. Wage and salary employment data identify which industries have the largest number of jobs. An industry with a large number of workers may not necessarily be expanding; it may even be downsizing. New and expanding industries may not have large numbers of existing jobs but are a good source for new job opportunities. Annual average data over time tend to be a better indicator of employment trends for the various industries in an area.
