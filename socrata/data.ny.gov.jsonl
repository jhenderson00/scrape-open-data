Therefore,  several caveats are in order:  1.   The data appear exactly as reported by the taxpayer. No validations or error corrections were  performed by the Department. 2.   Likewise, the information represents the taxpayer\u2019s position on the return as filed and does  not reflect any adjustments made either during return processing or in the course of an audit. 3.   Reporting is limited to the entity earning credit as determined by the credit forms filed with  the tax return. 4.   The actual amount of credit claimed during the period covered by this report may exceed what  is reported here. This can occur if recipients of credit from pass-through entities file returns  claiming credit, but the entity has not yet filed a return. 5. Amounts do not necessarily represent finished projects. Some of these projects may be works-  in-progress. The clean-up components are available for 5 years and the property component is  available for 10 years. 6.   In the 2010, 2011, and 2012 tax years, taxpayers are required to defer amounts of credits used  and refunded that in the aggregate exceed $2 million. Excess brownfield credits deferred will be  available as follows: 50% of total deferred allowed in 2013; 75% of remaining credit allowed in  2014; all remaining credit allowed in 2015.  Data in the report are amounts computed prior to  deferral. 7.   No brownfield redevelopment credit submissions were received for calendar years 2005 and 2006.

Typically, during the winter holiday shopping season retail jobs increase, and during the summer there are more workers in the construction industry. On the other hand, changes may reflect new businesses, expansions, closings, etc. Comparison of monthly changes for the same period in prior years will provide a better understanding of whether the change is seasonal or atypical.

In this situation, a record of the intercept would appear in each of the affected districts.  The total amount intercepted won\u2019t change but the total number of intercepts may be slightly larger than what appears on the file from the Gaming Commission to OTDA. A recipient\u2019s PA obligation is based on the prorated share of the benefits issued within the last ten (10) years.  Additionally, some payment types are not eligible for the LIM.  Therefore, a recipient\u2019s payment history may not include all of the PA benefits issued by the SSDs. Excess intercepts result from process timing issue.  This includes a recipient, current or former, who claims multiple prizes within a short amount of time (hours or days).  Another situation would include a change to a recipient\u2019s PA obligation which can take up to 60 days to be processed.
