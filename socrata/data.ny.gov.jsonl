DCJS compiles these reports as New York's official crime statistics and submits them to the FBI under the National Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. UCR uses standard offense definitions to count crime in localities across America regardless of variations in crime laws from state to state. In New York State, law enforcement agencies use the UCR system to report their monthly crime totals to DCJS. The UCR reporting system collects information on seven crimes classified as Index offenses which are most commonly used to gauge overall crime volume.

See links to additional data documentation ('Additional Resources/See Also' section) below. Data for the report come directly from returns filed in the previous calendar year. Therefore,  several caveats are in order:  1.   The data appear exactly as reported by the taxpayer. No validations or error corrections were  performed by the Department. 2.   Likewise, the information represents the taxpayer\u2019s position on the return as filed and does  not reflect any adjustments made either during return processing or in the course of an audit. 3.   Reporting is limited to the entity earning credit as determined by the credit forms filed with  the tax return. 4.   The actual amount of credit claimed during the period covered by this report may exceed what  is reported here. This can occur if recipients of credit from pass-through entities file returns  claiming credit, but the entity has not yet filed a return. 5. Amounts do not necessarily represent finished projects. Some of these projects may be works-  in-progress. The clean-up components are available for 5 years and the property component is  available for 10 years. 6.   In the 2010, 2011, and 2012 tax years, taxpayers are required to defer amounts of credits used  and refunded that in the aggregate exceed $2 million. Excess brownfield credits deferred will be  available as follows: 50% of total deferred allowed in 2013; 75% of remaining credit allowed in  2014; all remaining credit allowed in 2015.  Data in the report are amounts computed prior to  deferral. 7.   No brownfield redevelopment credit submissions were received for calendar years 2005 and 2006.

Industries are classified according to their North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Monthly job estimates for areas below the state level are not adjusted for seasonal changes in employment. It is important to keep in mind that month-to-month changes may be due to regular seasonal patterns in an industry. Typically, during the winter holiday shopping season retail jobs increase, and during the summer there are more workers in the construction industry. On the other hand, changes may reflect new businesses, expansions, closings, etc. Comparison of monthly changes for the same period in prior years will provide a better understanding of whether the change is seasonal or atypical. Data adjusted for seasonal changes are only available for industry divisions at the state level. Monthly fluctuations in the wage and salary employment data are an essential part of the changes that occur in a dynamic economy of the county or region. It is important to study the data over time to evaluate the strength of the local economy. Wage and salary employment data identify which industries have the largest number of jobs.

UCR uses standard offense definitions to count crime in localities across America regardless of variations in crime laws from state to state.

The UCR reporting system collects information on seven crimes classified as Index offenses which are most commonly used to gauge overall crime volume. These include the violent crimes of murder/non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault; and the property crimes of burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft.

QCEW data encompass approximately 97 percent of New York's nonfarm employment, providing a virtual census of employees and their wages as well as the most complete universe of employment and wage data, by industry, at the State, regional and county levels. \"Covered\" employment refers broadly to both private-sector employees as well as state, county, and municipal government employees insured under the New York State Unemployment Insurance (UI) Act. Federal employees are insured under separate laws, but are considered covered for the purposes of the program. Employee categories not covered by UI include some agricultural workers, railroad workers, private household workers, student workers, the self-employed, and unpaid family workers. QCEW data are similar to monthly Current Employment Statistics (CES) data in that they reflect jobs by place of work; therefore, if a person holds two jobs, he or she is counted twice.

QCEW data encompass approximately 97 percent of New York's nonfarm employment, providing a virtual census of employees and their wages as well as the most complete universe of employment and wage data, by industry, at the State, regional and county levels. \"Covered\" employment refers broadly to both private-sector employees as well as state, county, and municipal government employees insured under the New York State Unemployment Insurance (UI) Act. Federal employees are insured under separate laws, but are considered covered for the purposes of the program. Employee categories not covered by UI include some agricultural workers, railroad workers, private household workers, student workers, the self-employed, and unpaid family workers. QCEW data are similar to monthly Current Employment Statistics (CES) data in that they reflect jobs by place of work; therefore, if a person holds two jobs, he or she is counted twice. However, since the QCEW program, by definition, only measures employment covered by unemployment insurance laws, its totals will not be the same as CES employment totals due to the employee categories excluded by UI.

Therefore, the information contained in these datasets does not reflect final values for all returns for any tax year.

Total tax collections are reported on a State fiscal basis (April 1 through March 31) and include receipts of various types of payments made to satisfy taxpayers\u2019 tax liability \u2013 including withholding, estimated payments, final payments, refunds, audit payments, and payments from delinquent accounts. Tax collections are reported in the Department\u2019s Fiscal Year Tax Collections reports, and not in these datasets. Caution: The current datasets are based on population data. For tax years prior to 2015, data were based on sample data. Data customers are advised to use caution when drawing conclusions comparing data for tax years prior to 2015 and subsequent tax years.

As host to international and national championships, the Authority has brought millions of athletes and spectators to the regions it serves. \r\nNew York State, the Department of Economic Development and our local elected officials have developed an alliance, allowing ORDA and its surrounding communities, to remain at the forefront of winter and summer sports training, competition, recreation, and tourism by investing in the modernization of these facilities. In turn, this allows us to become a strong partner with local and regional businesses in supporting and building the tourism industry throughout the State.\r\nThis data set contains the daily admissions figures for all locations operated by ORDA.

The mandate requires the Department to include the name of each taxpayer claiming the Excelsior tax credit, the amount of each credit component earned by the taxpayer, and any other information received regarding the credit which the commissioner deems useful in evaluating the use of the credit. In instances where the credit is earned by a pass-through entity such as a limited liability company (LLC), a partnership, or an S corporation, information will only be reported for the entity. Names of individual members of the LLC, partners, or S corp shareholders will not be reported. Because the credit is fully refundable, the amount of credit earned is equal to the impact on the state financial plan. Data for the report come directly from returns filed in the previous calendar year. Therefore, several caveats are in order: 1. The data appear exactly as reported by the taxpayer. No validations or error corrections were performed by the Department. 2. Likewise, the information represents the taxpayer\u2019s position on the return as filed and does not reflect any adjustments made either during return processing or in the course of an audit. 3. Reporting is limited to the entity earning credit as determined by the credit forms filed with the tax return. 4. The actual amount of credit claimed during the period covered by this report may exceed what is reported here. This can occur if recipients of credit from pass-through entities file returns claiming credit, but the entity has not yet filed a return. 5. The report covers returns received by the Tax Department in a calendar year, which generally includes returns for the prior year.  However, as a result of statutorily-permitted filing extensions and differing fiscal years, some returns for a certain tax year may take up to three years to be filed.

First, data cannot be disclosed where there are fewer than three taxpayers reporting values.  However, to prevent data users from backing into the undisclosed data, corresponding data suppression had to occur in another categorical range.  These suppressed data items often had observations greater than three.  For credits where a limited number of claims trigger disclosure provisions, only credit component totals are displayed. In some cases, specifically in tax years 2001 through 2010, even this level of aggregation is not sufficient and consequently there is no data provided for certain credits.  However, beginning with tax year 2011 all credits will be reported.  Therefore, a disproportionate number of zeros may be present signifying a lack of credit utilization.  Second, the datasets only contain data for corporate franchise taxpayers filing under Article 9-A and do not include credit claimed under other articles of the tax law. Third, due to the use of fiscal (as opposed to calendar) year periods and statutorily-permitted filing extensions, the Tax Department does not have complete data for a tax year until several years later.  Accordingly, the data in this dataset may not accurately portray the magnitude of the fiscal impact of these credits in the most recently reported fiscal year.  Other limitations include data not reflecting changes made in the course of an audit or resulting from an amended filing.  Amounts carried forward from one year may not match amounts reported as carried in for the following year for several reasons. Audit adjustments in one year will change the utilization of credit in future years. Changes in the filing composition of a taxpayer due to mergers, acquisitions, or divestitures may impact the amount of credit reported. Some taxpayers may go out of business altogether.

In instances where the nondisclosure was extensive or across numerous records and variables, entire sections are blanked out (as Noted with a numerical footnote) and only the totals are provided. The information reflects personal income tax return and amended return data received during the processing year. Therefore, the information contained in these datasets does not reflect final values for all returns for any tax year. The liability amounts contained in these datasets do not reflect actual tax collections. Total tax collections are reported on a State fiscal basis (April 1 through March 31) and include receipts of various types of payments made to satisfy taxpayers\u2019 tax liability \u2013 including withholding, estimated payments, final payments, refunds, audit payments, and payments from delinquent accounts. Tax collections are reported in the Department\u2019s Fiscal Year Tax Collections reports, and not in these datasets. Caution: The current datasets are based on population data. For tax years prior to 2015, data were based on sample data. Data customers are advised to use caution when drawing conclusions comparing data for tax years prior to 2015 and subsequent tax years.

Through RESRFP22-1, NYSERDA seeks to procure approximately 4.5 million Tier 1 eligible Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) from eligible facilities that enter commercial operation on or after January 1, 2015 and on or before November 30, 2024, unless extended to November 30, 2027.\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate the protection of agricultural lands, developers participating in RESRFP22-1 or the NY-Sun program may be responsible for making an agricultural mitigation payment to a designated fund based on the extent to which the solar project\u2019s facility area overlaps with an Agricultural District and New York\u2019s highly productive agricultural soils, identified as Mineral Soil Groups (MSG) classifications 1 through 4 (MSG 1-4). This mitigation approach is designed to discourage solar projects from siting on MSG 1-4.  Furthermore, this mitigation approach is designed to encourage retaining agricultural productivity on the project site.  Instances where Proposers cannot avoid or minimize impacts on MSG 1-4 will result in a payment to a fund administered by NYSERDA. Disbursement of collected agricultural mitigation payment funds will be informed by consultation with the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets (AGM) to support ongoing regional agricultural practices and/or soil conservation initiatives.\r\n\r\nThis dataset contains a combination of soils data from multiple sources to serve participants of NYSERDA\u2019s Large-Scale Renewable and NY-Sun programs. The NYSERDA 2022 Soils Data was created by converting the 2022 New York State Agricultural Land Classification master list of soils maintained by AGM to a tabular form and providing a corresponding unique identifier for each listed soil that enables the user to link the soils to the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) SSURGO soils database, allowing for a geographical representation.  When the NYSERDA 2022 Soils Data is joined with spatial data from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) SSURGO soils database, the corresponding soil unit can be mapped in a geographic information system software.  The latest version of the SSURGO database should be used to get the most accurate join.  Data is updated yearly from both NRCS and from AGM, however, NYSERDA will not update this dataset and it will remain intact for future reference. NYSERDA intends on creating new soils datasets for future procurements on an annual basis.\r\n\r\nThe New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) offers objective information and analysis, innovative programs, technical expertise, and support to help New Yorkers increase energy efficiency, save money, use renewable energy, and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

Therefore,  several caveats are in order:  1.   The data appear exactly as reported by the taxpayer. No validations or error corrections were  performed by the Department. 2.   Likewise, the information represents the taxpayer\u2019s position on the return as filed and does  not reflect any adjustments made either during return processing or in the course of an audit. 3.   Reporting is limited to the entity earning credit as determined by the credit forms filed with  the tax return. 4.   The actual amount of credit claimed during the period covered by this report may exceed what  is reported here. This can occur if recipients of credit from pass-through entities file returns  claiming credit, but the entity has not yet filed a return. 5. Amounts do not necessarily represent finished projects. Some of these projects may be works-  in-progress. The clean-up components are available for 5 years and the property component is  available for 10 years. 6.   In the 2010, 2011, and 2012 tax years, taxpayers are required to defer amounts of credits used  and refunded that in the aggregate exceed $2 million. Excess brownfield credits deferred will be  available as follows: 50% of total deferred allowed in 2013; 75% of remaining credit allowed in  2014; all remaining credit allowed in 2015.  Data in the report are amounts computed prior to  deferral. 7.   No brownfield redevelopment credit submissions were received for calendar years 2005 and 2006.
