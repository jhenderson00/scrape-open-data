This could include city-owned poles/structures; third party-owned poles/structures; or any other structure that can be modified to support small cell installation, such as a bus shelter or certain types of street sights. In this case, right-of-way refers to the location of the antenna and supporting equipment.\n\nThe purpose of small cell permits in the right of way is for the provision of wireless service to the public.
