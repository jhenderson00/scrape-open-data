The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.\n\nThe survey was administered during the winter of 2023 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was met, with a total of 1,235 residents completing the survey. The overall residents for the sample of 1,408 households have a precision of at least +/-2.8% at the 95% level of confidence, and are demographically representative of our city's population.\n\nThis survey provides insight into where we are excelling in service delivery and where our local government could benefit from intentional improvement and resources.\n\nRead the full report on survey results here:\nhttps://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/manager/community-survey/\n\nFind the Community Perceptions Survey Dashboard here:\nhttps://insights.cincinnati-oh.gov/stories/s/Community-Perceptions-Survey-Version-2/3nn5-m4kg/\n\nFind the 2021 Community Perceptions Survey Data here:\nhttps://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/efficient-service-delivery/Community-Perceptions-Survey-2021/pkyn-d5t4/about_data", "attribution": "City of Cincinnati", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-04-16T17:55:03.000Z", "createdAt": "2024-04-16T16:51:01.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-04-16T17:55:03.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-04-16T17:12:31.000Z", "columns_name": ["Quality of Greater Cincinnati Water Works customer service", "Timeliness of water line repairs", "Condition of catch basins (storm drains) in your neighborhood", "It is easy to file officer complaints with the Citizen Complaint Authority (CCA)", "Police use good judgement in the use of force", "Police have appropriate training on how to handle confrontations with civilians", "Police treat residents of different races/ethnicities equally", "Police are held accountable for any misconduct", "Visibility of police in neighborhoods", "Enforcement of local traffic laws", "Which FOUR of the public safety services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the CIty over the next TWO years (4th)", "Which FOUR of the public safety services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the CIty over the next TWO years (3rd)", "Which FOUR of the public safety services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the CIty over the next TWO years (2nd)", "Which FOUR of the public safety services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the CIty over the next TWO years (1st)", "Fire education programs", "Fire inspections", "Which THREE of the parks and recreation services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (2nd)", "Which THREE of the parks and recreation services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (3rd)", "Are you aware that GCWW provides a cost-free program to replace existing lead pipes on private property within the City", "If you have a private lead line  would you sign up for the program", "Unsure if I have lead pipes", "Maintenance of street signs and traffic signals", "Quality of facilities such as picnic shelters and playgrounds in city parks", "Maintenance of City parks", "Which THREE of the neighborhood services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the CIty over the next TWO years (3rd)", "Which THREE of the neighborhood services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the CIty over the next TWO years (2nd)", "Which THREE of the neighborhood services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the CIty over the next TWO years (1st)", "Overall quality of recycling drop-off centers", "Overall quality of curbside recycling services", "Enforcing trash, weeds, and exterior maintenance in your neighborhood", "Enforcing the exterior maintenance of residential, commercial, and business property (e.g., condition of buildings)", "Enforcing the mowing and cutting of weeds on private property", "Enforcing the clean-up of trash and debris on private property", "Access and ability to interact with City Administration (City Manager, Dept.

This community engagement tool was designed to allow the City Administration to evaluate resident satisfaction with our services and measure that level of satisfaction against cities of similar size, location, and demographics. The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.\n\nThe survey was administered during the winter of 2021 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was exceeded, with a total of 1,408 residents completing the survey. The overall residents for the sample of 1,408 households have a precision of at least +/-2.6% at the 95% level of confidence, and are demographically representative of our city's population.\n\nThis year's survey will set a baseline for Cincinnati to work from with the goal of better understanding where we are excelling in service delivery and where our local government could benefit from intentional improvement and resources.\n\nFind the link to the Survey landing page here:\nhttps://etcinstitute.com/directionfinder2-0/city-of-cincinnati-ohio/", "attribution": "City of Cincinnati",
