The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.\n\nThe survey was administered during the winter of 2021 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was exceeded, with a total of 1,408 residents completing the survey. The overall residents for the sample of 1,408 households have a precision of at least +/-2.6% at the 95% level of confidence, and are demographically representative of our city's population.\n\nThis year's survey will set a baseline for Cincinnati to work from with the goal of better understanding where we are excelling in service delivery and where our local government could benefit from intentional improvement and resources.\n\nFind the link to the Survey landing page here:\nhttps://etcinstitute.com/directionfinder2-0/city-of-cincinnati-ohio/", "attribution": "City of Cincinnati", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-05-20T18:02:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:09.000Z", "columns_name": ["WCPO", "Communications from Council Members", "0", "Other", "Which THREE of the communication and community engagement services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (3rd)", "Which THREE of the communication and community engagement services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (1st)", "Access to information about Finance and Budget information", "Access to information about Boards and Commissions meetings\n(schedules, agendas, videos)", "Access to information about City Council meetings (schedules,\nagendas, videos)", "City Administration's use of social media", "Opportunity to engage/provide input regarding City operations in public engagement opportunities provided by the City Administration", "Opportunity to engage/provide input into decisions made by Elected Officials", "Overall usefulness of City website", "As a place to retire", "Overall image of the City", "How safe you feel in your neighborhood", "Fire and ambulance services", "City parks and recreation programs/facilities", "The City's Customer Service Call Center", "The City's 911 Call Center", "Customer service you receive from City employees", "Overall effectiveness of city communication with the public", "Which THREE of the major service categories of City services listed in question do you think should recieve the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years?

This dataset encompasses all fire incidents reported to NFIRS that were responded to by the Cincinnati Fire Department in the year 2019.\n\nData Creation: NFIRS was created in 1976 to address the United State\u2019s fire problem and is jointly managed by the U.S Fire Administration (USFA) and the National Fire Information Council (NFIC). Over the life of the system, all 50 states, more than 40 major metropolitan areas, and more than 15,000 fire departments have participated in NFIRS. Fore more information please visit: https://www.usfa.fema.gov/data/nfirs/about/index.html\n\nData Created By: The source of this data is the Cincinnati Fire Department.\n\nRefresh Frequency: This dataset is static and posted annually.\n\nData Dictionary: A data dictionary providing definitions of columns and attributes is available as an attachment to this dataset.\n\nProcessing: The City of Cincinnati is committed to providing the most granular and accurate data possible.
