The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.\n\nThe survey was administered during the winter of 2021 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was exceeded, with a total of 1,408 residents completing the survey. The overall residents for the sample of 1,408 households have a precision of at least +/-2.6% at the 95% level of confidence, and are demographically representative of our city's population.\n\nThis year's survey will set a baseline for Cincinnati to work from with the goal of better understanding where we are excelling in service delivery and where our local government could benefit from intentional improvement and resources.\n\nFind the link to the Survey landing page here:\nhttps://etcinstitute.com/directionfinder2-0/city-of-cincinnati-ohio/", "attribution": "City of Cincinnati", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-05-20T18:02:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:09.000Z", "columns_name": ["Maintenance of City recreation centers", "Which THREE of the communication and community engagement services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (1st)", "Which THREE of the communication and community engagement services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (3rd)", "Other", "0", "Communications from Council Members", "Local Newspapers", "WCPO", "Local 2", "Enquirer", "0 1", "Which THREE of the sources from Question 2 do you MOST PREFER to use to get information about the City of Cincinnati (1st)", "Which THREE of the sources from Question 2 do you MOST PREFER to use to get information about the City of Cincinnati (3rd)", "What type of dwelling do you live in", "Approximately how many years have you lived in Cincinnati, Ohio", "Were you or anyone in your household the victim of any crime in Cincinnati, OH during the last year", "Have any members of your household used the Cincinnati, OH, ambulance service in the last year", "Have any members of your household visited any parks in Cincinnati, OH in the last year", "Have you used the Cincinnati Bell Connector (Streetcar) in the last year", "Have you paid a City of Cincinnati parking ticket online in the last year", "Have you contacted Greater Cincinnati Water Works regardingyour account in the last year", "Have you or anyone in your household called 911 while in Cincinnati, OH in the last year", "Other 3", "Other 4", "Would you say your total annual household income is", "What is your age?", "STATE", "ZIPCODE", "SNA_NEIGHBORHOOD", "The Parks Department's youth programs and activities", "Enforcing the exterior maintenance of commercial/business property (e.g., condition of buildings)", "Which THREE of the street, sidewalk, and infrastructure services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (2nd)", "Which THREE of the street, sidewalk, and infrastructure services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (1st)", "Mowing and tree trimming along city streets and other public\nareas", "Flow of traffic on City streets in your community", "Quality of on-street bicycle infrastructure (bike\nlanes/wayfinding signs)", "Accessibility of streets, sidewalks, and buildings for people\nwith disabilities", "Snow removal on residential streets", "Snow removal on major City streets", "Condition of sidewalks in your neighborhood", "Condition of sidewalks in City", "Maintenance of city streets", "Which THREE of the major service categories of City services listed in question do you think should recieve the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years?
