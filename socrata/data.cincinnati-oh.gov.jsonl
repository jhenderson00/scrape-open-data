The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.\n\nThe survey was administered during the winter of 2021 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was exceeded, with a total of 1,408 residents completing the survey. The overall residents for the sample of 1,408 households have a precision of at least +/-2.6% at the 95% level of confidence, and are demographically representative of our city's population.\n\nThis year's survey will set a baseline for Cincinnati to work from with the goal of better understanding where we are excelling in service delivery and where our local government could benefit from intentional improvement and resources.\n\nFind the link to the Survey landing page here:\nhttps://etcinstitute.com/directionfinder2-0/city-of-cincinnati-ohio/", "attribution": "City of Cincinnati", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-05-20T18:02:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:09.000Z", "columns_name": ["The City's overall efforts to prevent crime", "Attitude and behavior of officers towards citizens in your neighborhood", "Efforts to collaborate with the public to address concerns", "Quality of dispatch/911 services", "Overall quality of local fire protection & rescue services", "Quality of local emergency medical service", "How quickly emergency medical personnel respond to emergencies", "Fire education programs", "Which THREE of the major service categories of City services listed in question do you think should recieve the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years?
