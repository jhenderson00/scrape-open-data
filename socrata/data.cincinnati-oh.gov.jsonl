The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.\n\nThe survey was administered during the winter of 2021 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was exceeded, with a total of 1,408 residents completing the survey. The overall residents for the sample of 1,408 households have a precision of at least +/-2.6% at the 95% level of confidence, and are demographically representative of our city's population.\n\nThis year's survey will set a baseline for Cincinnati to work from with the goal of better understanding where we are excelling in service delivery and where our local government could benefit from intentional improvement and resources.\n\nFind the link to the Survey landing page here:\nhttps://etcinstitute.com/directionfinder2-0/city-of-cincinnati-ohio/", "attribution": "City of Cincinnati", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-05-20T18:02:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:09.000Z", "columns_name": ["Have you used the bulky item pick-up service in the last year", "Have you visited the City's website (cincinnati-oh.gov) in the last year", "0Have you or anyone in your household contacted the City's Customer Service Call Center in the last year", "Have you had contact with a CPD police officer during the last year", "Other 2", "Do you own or rent your current residence", "Do you think you will be living in Cincinnati, Ohio, five years from now", "Which THREE of the sources from Question 2 do you MOST PREFER to use to get information about the City of Cincinnati (2nd)", "Cit4Beat", "Cincinnati Herald", "Business Courier", "Fox 9", "Other 1", "Reporters' Social Media", "Local TV News Stations", "CitWebsite", "CitSocial Media", "CitiCable", "CitBulletin", "Email", "As a place to live", "As a place to retire", "Professionalism of police officers", "Police outreach programs/services", "How quickly fire and rescue personnel respond to emergencies", "Fire inspections", "Which THREE of the major service categories of City services listed in question do you think should recieve the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years?
