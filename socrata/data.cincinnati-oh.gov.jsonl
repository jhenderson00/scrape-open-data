The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.\n\nThe survey was administered during the winter of 2021 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was exceeded, with a total of 1,408 residents completing the survey. The overall residents for the sample of 1,408 households have a precision of at least +/-2.6% at the 95% level of confidence, and are demographically representative of our city's population.\n\nThis year's survey will set a baseline for Cincinnati to work from with the goal of better understanding where we are excelling in service delivery and where our local government could benefit from intentional improvement and resources.\n\nFind the link to the Survey landing page here:\nhttps://etcinstitute.com/directionfinder2-0/city-of-cincinnati-ohio/", "attribution": "City of Cincinnati", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-05-20T18:02:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:09.000Z", "columns_name": ["Overall quality of leaf and brush drop-off centers", "SNA_NEIGHBORHOOD", "ZIPCODE", "STATE", "What is your age?", "Would you say your total annual household income is", "Other 4", "Other 3", "Have you or anyone in your household called 911 while in Cincinnati, OH in the last year", "Have you contacted Greater Cincinnati Water Works regardingyour account in the last year", "Have you paid a City of Cincinnati parking ticket online in the last year", "Have you used the Cincinnati Bell Connector (Streetcar) in the last year", "Have any members of your household visited any parks in Cincinnati, OH in the last year", "Have any members of your household used the Cincinnati, OH, ambulance service in the last year", "Were you or anyone in your household the victim of any crime in Cincinnati, OH during the last year", "Approximately how many years have you lived in Cincinnati, Ohio", "What type of dwelling do you live in", "Which THREE of the sources from Question 2 do you MOST PREFER to use to get information about the City of Cincinnati (3rd)", "Which THREE of the sources from Question 2 do you MOST PREFER to use to get information about the City of Cincinnati (1st)", "0 1", "Enquirer", "Local 2", "WCPO", "Local Newspapers", "Communications from Council Members", "0", "Other", "Which THREE of the communication and community engagement services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (3rd)", "Which THREE of the communication and community engagement services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (1st)", "Access to information about Finance and Budget information", "Access to information about Boards and Commissions meetings\n(schedules, agendas, videos)", "Access to information about City Council meetings (schedules,\nagendas, videos)", "City Administration's use of social media", "Opportunity to engage/provide input regarding City operations in public engagement opportunities provided by the City Administration", "Opportunity to engage/provide input into decisions made by Elected Officials", "Overall usefulness of City website", "Which THREE of the jobs and development services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (3rd)", "Which THREE of the jobs and development services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (2nd)", "City's efforts to support minority and women-owned\nbusinesses", "Adequate quantity of affordable housing units", "Which TWO of the public health services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (2nd)", "Food Safety Programs (e.g., inspections and investigations)", "Immunization Services", "City Administration (City Manager, Dept.
