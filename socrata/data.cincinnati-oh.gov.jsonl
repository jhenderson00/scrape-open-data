Through another ordinance, Ordinance No. 185-2017, and effective July 28, 2017, lead service lines are prohibited in the GCWW system. Enforcement of this ban is being phased in over time.\n\nThe private-side work is then done by contractors or plumbers who are contracted with GCWW through the City's procurement process, either for a water main replacement project, or from a pre-qualified list established through the City's Request for Qualifications (RFQ) process.
