This dataset encompasses all fire incidents reported to NFIRS that were responded to by the Cincinnati Fire Department in the year 2019.\n\nData Creation: NFIRS was created in 1976 to address the United State\u2019s fire problem and is jointly managed by the U.S Fire Administration (USFA) and the National Fire Information Council (NFIC). Over the life of the system, all 50 states, more than 40 major metropolitan areas, and more than 15,000 fire departments have participated in NFIRS. Fore more information please visit: https://www.usfa.fema.gov/data/nfirs/about/index.html\n\nData Created By: The source of this data is the Cincinnati Fire Department.\n\nRefresh Frequency: This dataset is static and posted annually.\n\nData Dictionary: A data dictionary providing definitions of columns and attributes is available as an attachment to this dataset.\n\nProcessing: The City of Cincinnati is committed to providing the most granular and accurate data possible. In that pursuit the Office of Performance and Data Analytics facilitates standard processing to most raw data prior to publication. Processing includes but is not limited: address verification, geocoding, decoding attributes, and addition of administrative areas (i.e. Census, neighborhoods, police districts, etc.).\n\nData Usage: For directions on downloading and using open data please visit our How-to Guide: https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/dataset/Open-Data-How-To-Guide/gdr9-g3ad\n\nDisclaimer: In compliance with privacy laws, all Public Safety datasets are anonymized and appropriately redacted prior to publication on the City of Cincinnati\u2019s Open Data Portal.

This could include city-owned poles/structures; third party-owned poles/structures; or any other structure that can be modified to support small cell installation, such as a bus shelter or certain types of street sights. In this case, right-of-way refers to the location of the antenna and supporting equipment.\n\nThe purpose of small cell permits in the right of way is for the provision of wireless service to the public.
