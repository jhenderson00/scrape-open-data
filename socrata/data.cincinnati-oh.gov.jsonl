This dataset encompasses all fire incidents reported to NFIRS that were responded to by the Cincinnati Fire Department in the year 2019.\n\nData Creation: NFIRS was created in 1976 to address the United State\u2019s fire problem and is jointly managed by the U.S Fire Administration (USFA) and the National Fire Information Council (NFIC). Over the life of the system, all 50 states, more than 40 major metropolitan areas, and more than 15,000 fire departments have participated in NFIRS. Fore more information please visit: https://www.usfa.fema.gov/data/nfirs/about/index.html\n\nData Created By: The source of this data is the Cincinnati Fire Department.\n\nRefresh Frequency: This dataset is static and posted annually.\n\nData Dictionary: A data dictionary providing definitions of columns and attributes is available as an attachment to this dataset.\n\nProcessing: The City of Cincinnati is committed to providing the most granular and accurate data possible. In that pursuit the Office of Performance and Data Analytics facilitates standard processing to most raw data prior to publication. Processing includes but is not limited: address verification, geocoding, decoding attributes, and addition of administrative areas (i.e. Census, neighborhoods, police districts, etc.).\n\nData Usage: For directions on downloading and using open data please visit our How-to Guide: https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/dataset/Open-Data-How-To-Guide/gdr9-g3ad\n\nDisclaimer: In compliance with privacy laws, all Public Safety datasets are anonymized and appropriately redacted prior to publication on the City of Cincinnati\u2019s Open Data Portal. This means that for all public safety datasets: (1) the last two digits of all addresses have been replaced with \u201cXX,\u201d and in cases where there is a single digit street address, the entire address number is replaced with \"X\"; and (2) Latitude and Longitude have been randomly skewed to represent values within the same block area (but not the exact location) of the incident.", "attribution": "City of Cincinnati", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2021-08-16T14:28:15.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-01-06T13:39:45.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2021-08-16T14:28:15.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2020-01-06T13:40:11.000Z", "columns_name": ["INCIDENT_UNIQUE_ID", "SUPPRESSION_PER_COUNT", "OTHER_PER_COUNT", "ALARMS", "CAD_NUMBER", "INCIDENT_DATE", "INCIDENT_CLOSED", "EMS_APP_COUNT", "APT_SUITE_NO", "NEIGHBORHOOD", "EMS_PER_COUNT", "LONGITUDE", "CLEAR_TIME", "DISPATCH_TIME", "OTHER_APP_COUNT", "SUPPRESSION_APP_COUNT", "INCIDENT_TYPE_DESC", "INCIDENT_TYPE_ID", "ZIP", "CITY", "STREET_ADDRESS", "UNIT_CLEAR_TIME", "APPARATUS", "ALARM_TIME", "INCIDENT_NUMBER", "LATITUDE", "ARRIVE_TIME"], "columns_field_name": ["incident_unique_id", "suppression_per_count", "other_per_count", "alarms", "cad_number", "incident_date", "incident_closed", "ems_app_count", "apt_suite_no", "neighborhood", "ems_per_count", "longitude", "clear_time", "dispatch_time", "other_app_count", "suppression_app_count", "incident_type_desc", "incident_type_id", "zip", "city", "street_address", "unit_clear_time", "apparatus", "alarm_time", "incident_number", "latitude", "arrive_time"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Date", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Date", "Date", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Date", "Text", "Date", "Text", "Number", "Date"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-01-14T13:57:10.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["infrastructure", "public safety", "housing & development"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Safety", "domain_tags": ["cfd", "fire", "fire incident data", "national fire incident reporting", "nfirs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.cincinnati-oh.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/d/q9kf-y7ft", "link": "https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/Safety/2019-NFIRS-Cincinnati-Fire-Department-Incident-Dat/q9kf-y7ft", "owner": {"id": "wvxi-y5xi", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Office of Performance & Data Analytics"}, "creator": {"id": "wvxi-y5xi", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Office of Performance & Data Analytics"}}
