The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.\n\nThe survey was administered during the winter of 2021 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was exceeded, with a total of 1,408 residents completing the survey. The overall residents for the sample of 1,408 households have a precision of at least +/-2.6% at the 95% level of confidence, and are demographically representative of our city's population.\n\nThis year's survey will set a baseline for Cincinnati to work from with the goal of better understanding where we are excelling in service delivery and where our local government could benefit from intentional improvement and resources.\n\nFind the link to the Survey landing page here:\nhttps://etcinstitute.com/directionfinder2-0/city-of-cincinnati-ohio/", "attribution": "City of Cincinnati", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-05-20T18:02:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:09.000Z", "columns_name": ["Quality of facilities such as picnic shelters and playgrounds in\ncity parks", "Ease of registering for Parks programs", "Access to healthy food that you can afford", "Elected officials' efforts to support a dialogue with City residents", "Availability of information about City programs and services", "Quality of City video programming (television channel and web streaming)", "Access to information about Campaign finance and lobbyist\ndisclosures", "Quality of the City's Open Data portal", "Which THREE of the communication and community engagement services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (2nd)", "Twitter", "Facebook", "Instagram", "LinkedIn", "Nextdoor", "Email", "CitBulletin", "CitiCable", "CitSocial Media", "CitWebsite", "Local TV News Stations", "Reporters' Social Media", "Other 1", "Fox 9", "Business Courier", "Cincinnati Herald", "Cit4Beat", "Which THREE of the sources from Question 2 do you MOST PREFER to use to get information about the City of Cincinnati (2nd)", "Do you think you will be living in Cincinnati, Ohio, five years from now", "Timeliness of water line repairs", "Ease in filing officer complaints with Citizen Complaint Authority (CCA)", "Which THREE of the major service categories of City services listed in question do you think should recieve the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years?
