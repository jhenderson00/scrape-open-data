This community engagement tool was designed to allow the City Administration to evaluate resident satisfaction with our services and measure that level of satisfaction against cities of similar size, location, and demographics. The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.\n\nThe survey was administered during the winter of 2021 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was exceeded, with a total of 1,408 residents completing the survey. The overall residents for the sample of 1,408 households have a precision of at least +/-2.6% at the 95% level of confidence, and are demographically representative of our city's population.\n\nThis year's survey will set a baseline for Cincinnati to work from with the goal of better understanding where we are excelling in service delivery and where our local government could benefit from intentional improvement and resources.\n\nFind the link to the Survey landing page here:\nhttps://etcinstitute.com/directionfinder2-0/city-of-cincinnati-ohio/", "attribution": "City of Cincinnati", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-05-20T18:02:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:09.000Z", "columns_name": ["CitSocial Media", "Fire and ambulance services", "Maintenance of streets in your neighborhood", "Which THREE of the major service categories of City services listed in question do you think should recieve the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years?
