This community engagement tool was designed to allow the City Administration to evaluate resident satisfaction with our services and measure that level of satisfaction against cities of similar size, location, and demographics. The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.\n\nThe survey was administered during the winter of 2021 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was exceeded, with a total of 1,408 residents completing the survey. The overall residents for the sample of 1,408 households have a precision of at least +/-2.6% at the 95% level of confidence, and are demographically representative of our city's population.\n\nThis year's survey will set a baseline for Cincinnati to work from with the goal of better understanding where we are excelling in service delivery and where our local government could benefit from intentional improvement and resources.\n\nFind the link to the Survey landing page here:\nhttps://etcinstitute.com/directionfinder2-0/city-of-cincinnati-ohio/", "attribution": "City of Cincinnati", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-05-20T18:02:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:09.000Z", "columns_name": ["The maintenance of city streets, sidewalks, & infrastructure", "Police services", "Overall quality of the City's public transportation system", "Physical appearance of your neighborhood", "Overall feeling of safety in the City", "Overall quality of life in the City", "Overall value you receive for your City tax dollars & fees", "Overall quality of services provided by City", "As a place where I feel welcome", "As a place to work", "As a place to raise children", "As a place to live", "DISTRICT", "CITY", "Please describe your gender indenty", "What is your gender identity?", "Are you of Hispanic, Latino, or other Spanish ancestry", "Black/African American", "American Indian/Eskimo", "White", "Asian/Pacific Islander", "Have you ridden a bicycle on city streets or trails in the last year", "Do you have regular access to the internet at home", "Have you used the Metro bus system in the last year", "Have you or anyone in your household visited a Cincinnati, Ohio community center in the last year", "Have you used the bulky item pick-up service in the last year", "Have you visited the City's website (cincinnati-oh.gov) in the last year", "0Have you or anyone in your household contacted the City's Customer Service Call Center in the last year", "Have you had contact with a CPD police officer during the last year", "Other 2", "Do you own or rent your current residence", "Do you think you will be living in Cincinnati, Ohio, five years from now", "Which THREE of the sources from Question 2 do you MOST PREFER to use to get information about the City of Cincinnati (2nd)", "Cit4Beat", "Cincinnati Herald", "Business Courier", "Which THREE of the jobs and development services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (1st)", "Condition of sidewalks in City", "Maintenance of city streets", "Which THREE of the major service categories of City services listed in question do you think should recieve the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years?
