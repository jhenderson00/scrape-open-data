{"resource": {"name": "Community Perceptions Survey 2023", "id": "k3wu-iek9", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "The Cincinnati Community Perceptions Survey was developed by the City's Office of Performance and Data Analytics and ETC Institute in the fall of 2021. This community engagement tool was designed to allow the City Administration to evaluate resident satisfaction with our services and measure that level of satisfaction against cities of similar size, location, and demographics. The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.\n\nThe survey was administered during the winter of 2023 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was met, with a total of 1,235 residents completing the survey. The overall residents for the sample of 1,408 households have a precision of at least +/-2.8% at the 95% level of confidence, and are demographically representative of our city's population.\n\nThis survey provides insight into where we are excelling in service delivery and where our local government could benefit from intentional improvement and resources.\n\nRead the full report on survey results here:\nhttps://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/manager/community-survey/\n\nFind the Community Perceptions Survey Dashboard here:\nhttps://insights.cincinnati-oh.gov/stories/s/Community-Perceptions-Survey-Version-2/3nn5-m4kg/\n\nFind the 2021 Community Perceptions Survey Data here:\nhttps://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/efficient-service-delivery/Community-Perceptions-Survey-2021/pkyn-d5t4/about_data", "attribution": "City of Cincinnati", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-04-16T17:55:03.000Z", "createdAt": "2024-04-16T16:51:01.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-04-16T17:55:03.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-04-16T17:12:31.000Z", "columns_name": ["Which THREE of the neighborhood services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the CIty over the next TWO years (2nd)", "Effectiveness of local police protection", "The City's overall efforts to prevent crime", "Public safety services in public parks", "How quickly police respond to emergencies", "Overall police performance in your neighborhood", "Professionalism of police officers", "Attitude and behavior of officers towards citizens in your neighborhood", "Efforts to collaborate with the public to address concerns", "Police outreach programs/services", "Quality of dispatch/911 services", "Overall quality of local fire protection and rescue services", "How quickly fire and rescue personnel respond to emergencies", "Quality of local emergency medical service", "Have any members of your household used the Cincinnati, OH, ambulance service in the last year", "Have you had contact with a CPD police officer during the last year", "Were you or anyone in your household the victim of any crime in Cincinnati, OH during the last year", "Overall quality of bulky item pick-up services", "Do you have regular access to the internet at home", "Overall effectiveness of leadership provided by the City's elected officials", "Have you paid a City of Cincinnati parking ticket online in the last year", "Have any members of your household visited any parks in Cincinnati, OH in the last year", "City Administration (City Manager, Dept.

This community engagement tool was designed to allow the City Administration to evaluate resident satisfaction with our services and measure that level of satisfaction against cities of similar size, location, and demographics. The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.\n\nThe survey was administered during the winter of 2021 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was exceeded, with a total of 1,408 residents completing the survey. The overall residents for the sample of 1,408 households have a precision of at least +/-2.6% at the 95% level of confidence, and are demographically representative of our city's population.\n\nThis year's survey will set a baseline for Cincinnati to work from with the goal of better understanding where we are excelling in service delivery and where our local government could benefit from intentional improvement and resources.\n\nFind the link to the Survey landing page here:\nhttps://etcinstitute.com/directionfinder2-0/city-of-cincinnati-ohio/", "attribution": "City of Cincinnati",

This dataset encompasses all fire incidents reported to NFIRS that were responded to by the Cincinnati Fire Department in the year 2019.\n\nData Creation: NFIRS was created in 1976 to address the United State\u2019s fire problem and is jointly managed by the U.S Fire Administration (USFA) and the National Fire Information Council (NFIC). Over the life of the system, all 50 states, more than 40 major metropolitan areas, and more than 15,000 fire departments have participated in NFIRS. Fore more information please visit: https://www.usfa.fema.gov/data/nfirs/about/index.html\n\nData Created By: The source of this data is the Cincinnati Fire Department.\n\nRefresh Frequency: This dataset is static and posted annually.\n\nData Dictionary: A data dictionary providing definitions of columns and attributes is available as an attachment to this dataset.\n\nProcessing: The City of Cincinnati is committed to providing the most granular and accurate data possible. In that pursuit the Office of Performance and Data Analytics facilitates standard processing to most raw data prior to publication.
