This community engagement tool was designed to allow the City Administration to evaluate resident satisfaction with our services and measure that level of satisfaction against cities of similar size, location, and demographics. The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.\n\nThe survey was administered during the winter of 2023 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was met, with a total of 1,235 residents completing the survey. The overall residents for the sample of 1,408 households have a precision of at least +/-2.8% at the 95% level of confidence, and are demographically representative of our city's population.\n\nThis survey provides insight into where we are excelling in service delivery and where our local government could benefit from intentional improvement and resources.\n\nRead the full report on survey results here:\nhttps://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/manager/community-survey/\n\nFind the Community Perceptions Survey Dashboard here:\nhttps://insights.cincinnati-oh.gov/stories/s/Community-Perceptions-Survey-Version-2/3nn5-m4kg/\n\nFind the 2021 Community Perceptions Survey Data here:\nhttps://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/efficient-service-delivery/Community-Perceptions-Survey-2021/pkyn-d5t4/about_data", "attribution": "City of Cincinnati", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-04-16T17:55:03.000Z", "createdAt": "2024-04-16T16:51:01.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-04-16T17:55:03.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-04-16T17:12:31.000Z", "columns_name": ["Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander", "Race Other Text", "What is your age", "Self-describe your gender", "Zip", "Zone", "The Recreation Department's youth programs and activities", "Walking and biking trails in the City", "Maintenance of City parks", "Which THREE of the neighborhood services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the CIty over the next TWO years (3rd)", "Which THREE of the neighborhood services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the CIty over the next TWO years (2nd)", "Which THREE of the neighborhood services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the CIty over the next TWO years (1st)", "Overall quality of recycling drop-off centers", "Overall quality of curbside recycling services", "Enforcing trash, weeds, and exterior maintenance in your neighborhood", "Enforcing the exterior maintenance of residential, commercial, and business property (e.g., condition of buildings)", "Enforcing the mowing and cutting of weeds on private property", "Enforcing the clean-up of trash and debris on private property", "Access and ability to interact with City Administration (City Manager, Dept.

This community engagement tool was designed to allow the City Administration to evaluate resident satisfaction with our services and measure that level of satisfaction against cities of similar size, location, and demographics. The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.\n\nThe survey was administered during the winter of 2021 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was exceeded, with a total of 1,408 residents completing the survey. The overall residents for the sample of 1,408 households have a precision of at least +/-2.6% at the 95% level of confidence, and are demographically representative of our city's population.\n\nThis year's survey will set a baseline for Cincinnati to work from with the goal of better understanding where we are excelling in service delivery and where our local government could benefit from intentional improvement and resources.\n\nFind the link to the Survey landing page here:\nhttps://etcinstitute.com/directionfinder2-0/city-of-cincinnati-ohio/", "attribution": "City of Cincinnati", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-04-16T17:28:36.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-05-20T18:02:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-04-16T17:28:36.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:09.000Z", "columns_name": ["Public safety services in public parks", "Professionalism of police officers", "Police outreach programs/services", "How quickly fire and rescue personnel respond to emergencies", "Fire inspections", "Which THREE of the major service categories of City services listed in question do you think should recieve the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years?
