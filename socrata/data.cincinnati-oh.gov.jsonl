This community engagement tool was designed to allow the City Administration to evaluate resident satisfaction with our services and measure that level of satisfaction against cities of similar size, location, and demographics. The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.\n\nThe survey was administered during the winter of 2023 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was met, with a total of 1,235 residents completing the survey. The overall residents for the sample of 1,408 households have a precision of at least +/-2.8% at the 95% level of confidence, and are demographically representative of our city's population.\n\nThis survey provides insight into where we are excelling in service delivery and where our local government could benefit from intentional improvement and resources.\n\nRead the full report on survey results here:\nhttps://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/manager/community-survey/\n\nFind the Community Perceptions Survey Dashboard here:\nhttps://insights.cincinnati-oh.gov/stories/s/Community-Perceptions-Survey-Version-2/3nn5-m4kg/\n\nFind the 2021 Community Perceptions Survey Data here:\nhttps://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/efficient-service-delivery/Community-Perceptions-Survey-2021/pkyn-d5t4/about_data", "attribution": "City of Cincinnati", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-04-16T17:55:03.000Z", "createdAt": "2024-04-16T16:51:01.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-04-16T17:55:03.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-04-16T17:12:31.000Z", "columns_name": ["Which of the communication and community engagement services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (3rd)", "Email", "Reporters Social Media", "Are you of Hispanic  Latino  or other Spanish ancestry", "Elected officials' efforts to support a dialogue with City residents", "Quality of City video programming (television channel and web streaming)", "Social Other", "Timeliness of sewer line and sewer main repairs", "Code enforcement (enforcing condition standards of residential, commercial, and business property in the City)", "LinkedIn", "Other recreation facilities - tennis courts, golf courses", "Facebook", "City Administration (City Manager, Dept.

The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.\n\nThe survey was administered during the winter of 2021 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was exceeded, with a total of 1,408 residents completing the survey.
