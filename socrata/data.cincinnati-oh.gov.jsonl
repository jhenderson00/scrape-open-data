Every time an RFID tag is read by the recycling truck a row is recorded in the data set. The account number in the data set is the account number that the cart belongs to. Each account number may have a varying number of carts. \n\nThe account number used by the recycling company is also an ID used in our databases for referring to addresses. In our address database each record has an account number (aka address_guid) and an addressid. The important thing to note is that some addressid's may have multiple account numbers (aka addr_guid's). For example, some condo complexes have an account number (aka addr_guid) for every unit in the complex. This does not mean that every building with multiple units will have multiple account numbers for each addressid.\n\nThe columns that contain information on the type of residence the address is have data that was pulled in November 2022. This may have implications when looking at historical data structure types. For example, an account number was a one family dwelling in 2019 but remodeled and reclassified as a 4-family dwelling in 2022. The records where this is the case however should be small.\n\nThe dataset contains tips from all recycling accounts, so commercial and municipal account tips will also appear in the dataset. This will need to be accounted for when analyzing and filters may need to be applied to look at specific groups such as residential single family dwellings.\n \nColumn Info:\nADDR_TYPE:\nADR = Address\nBLD = Building\nPAR = Parcel\nCON = CONDO\n\nCategory:\nSpecifies if the address is classified as \"Residential\" or \"Commercial\" use for example.\n\nDescription:\nA more granular description of the address for example Category could be \"Residential\" and Description could be \"Single Family Dwelling\"", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-01-24T15:11:38.000Z", "createdAt": "2023-01-20T19:02:03.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-01-24T15:11:38.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-01-23T20:58:41.000Z", "columns_name": ["TIP_LATITUDE", "YN_LONGTERM_VACANT", "Zip Codes", "RF_SERVICE_TYPE", "TRUCK_NUMBER", "ADDRTYPE", "RF_PRODUCT_SIZE", "BLDID", "PARCELID", "JURIS_ABBRV", "ACCOUNT_NUMBER", "ASSET_SERIAL_TIPPED", "CONTAINER_RFID_TIPPED", "TIP_DATE_TIME", "TIP_LONGITUDE", "COLLECTION_ROUTE_NUMBER", "ADDRESSID", "FULLMAILADR", "X_COORD", "Y_COORD", "ADDRESS_LATITUDE", "ADDRESS_LONGITUDE", "CATEGORY", "DESCRIPTION", "SNA_NEIGHBORHOOD", "ADDRESS_GEOCODED"], "columns_field_name": ["tip_latitude", "yn_longterm_vacant", ":@computed_region_tumi_599q", "rf_service_type", "truck_number", "addrtype", "rf_product_size", "bldid", "parcelid", "juris_abbrv", "account_number", "asset_serial_tipped", "container_rfid_tipped", "tip_date_time", "tip_longitude", "collection_route_number", "addressid", "fullmailadr", "x_coord", "y_coord", "address_latitude", "address_longitude", "category", "description", "sna_neighborhood", "address_geocoded"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Checkbox", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Point"], "columns_description": ["The latitude the tip was read at.

This community engagement tool was designed to allow the City Administration to evaluate resident satisfaction with our services and measure that level of satisfaction against cities of similar size, location, and demographics. The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.\n\nThe survey was administered during the winter of 2021 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was exceeded, with a total of 1,408 residents completing the survey. The overall residents for the sample of 1,408 households have a precision of at least +/-2.6% at the 95% level of confidence, and are demographically representative of our city's population.\n\nThis year's survey will set a baseline for Cincinnati to work from with the goal of better understanding where we are excelling in service delivery and where our local government could benefit from intentional improvement and resources.\n\nFind the link to the Survey landing page here:\nhttps://etcinstitute.com/directionfinder2-0/city-of-cincinnati-ohio/", "attribution": "City of Cincinnati", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-05-20T18:02:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:09.000Z", "columns_name": ["Access to job training programs", "Maintenance of street signs and traffic signals", "Adequacy of city street lighting", "Overall cleanliness of City streets and other public areas", "Which THREE of the street, sidewalk, and infrastructure services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (3rd)", "Enforcing the clean-up of trash and debris on private property", "Enforcing the mowing and cutting of weeds on private property", "Enforcing the exterior maintenance of residential property (e.g.,condition of buildings)", "Enforcing trash, weeds, and exterior maintenance in your neighborhood", "Overall quality of recycling drop-off centers", "Overall quality of leaf and brush drop-off centers", "Walking and biking trails in the City", "Quality of customer service from Parks employees", "Other recreation facilities - tennis courts, golf courses", "Which THREE of the parks and recreation services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (3rd)", "Access and ability to interact with elected officials", "Support for entrepreneurs and small business owners\navailable in the City", "Ability to obtain training opportunities to advance your career", "City Administration (City Manager, Dept.
