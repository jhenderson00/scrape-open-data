The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.\n\nThe survey was administered during the winter of 2021 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was exceeded, with a total of 1,408 residents completing the survey. The overall residents for the sample of 1,408 households have a precision of at least +/-2.6% at the 95% level of confidence, and are demographically representative of our city's population.\n\nThis year's survey will set a baseline for Cincinnati to work from with the goal of better understanding where we are excelling in service delivery and where our local government could benefit from intentional improvement and resources.\n\nFind the link to the Survey landing page here:\nhttps://etcinstitute.com/directionfinder2-0/city-of-cincinnati-ohio/", "attribution": "City of Cincinnati", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-05-20T18:02:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:09.000Z", "columns_name": ["Job opportunities available within the city limits", "City's use of economic development incentives to support\neconomic opportunity for residents", "Access to job training programs", "Access to quality child care that you can afford", "Access to quality mental health care that you can afford", "Access to quality housing you can afford", "Which THREE of the jobs and development services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (1st)", "Which THREE of the jobs and development services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (2nd)", "Which THREE of the jobs and development services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (3rd)", "Overall usefulness of City website", "Opportunity to engage/provide input into decisions made by Elected Officials", "Opportunity to engage/provide input regarding City operations in public engagement opportunities provided by the City Administration", "City Administration's use of social media", "Access to information about City Council meetings (schedules,\nagendas, videos)", "Access to information about Boards and Commissions meetings\n(schedules, agendas, videos)", "Access to information about Finance and Budget information", "Which THREE of the communication and community engagement services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (1st)", "Which THREE of the communication and community engagement services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (3rd)", "Other", "Maintenance of City recreation centers", "Overall cleanliness of City streets and other public areas", "Adequacy of city street lighting", "Maintenance of street signs and traffic signals", "Maintenance of streets in your neighborhood", "Which THREE of the major service categories of City services listed in question do you think should recieve the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years?
