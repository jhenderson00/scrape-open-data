The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.\n\nThe survey was administered during the winter of 2021 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was exceeded, with a total of 1,408 residents completing the survey. The overall residents for the sample of 1,408 households have a precision of at least +/-2.6% at the 95% level of confidence, and are demographically representative of our city's population.\n\nThis year's survey will set a baseline for Cincinnati to work from with the goal of better understanding where we are excelling in service delivery and where our local government could benefit from intentional improvement and resources.\n\nFind the link to the Survey landing page here:\nhttps://etcinstitute.com/directionfinder2-0/city-of-cincinnati-ohio/", "attribution": "City of Cincinnati", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-05-20T18:02:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:09.000Z", "columns_name": ["The maintenance of city streets, sidewalks, & infrastructure", "Police services", "Overall quality of the City's public transportation system", "Physical appearance of your neighborhood", "Overall feeling of safety in the City", "Overall quality of life in the City", "Overall value you receive for your City tax dollars & fees", "Overall quality of services provided by City", "As a place where I feel welcome", "As a place to work", "As a place to raise children", "As a place to live", "DISTRICT", "CITY", "Please describe your gender indenty", "What is your gender identity?", "Are you of Hispanic, Latino, or other Spanish ancestry", "Black/African American", "American Indian/Eskimo", "White", "Asian/Pacific Islander", "Have you ridden a bicycle on city streets or trails in the last year", "Do you have regular access to the internet at home", "Have you used the Metro bus system in the last year", "Have you or anyone in your household visited a Cincinnati, Ohio community center in the last year", "Have you used the bulky item pick-up service in the last year", "Have you visited the City's website (cincinnati-oh.gov) in the last year", "0Have you or anyone in your household contacted the City's Customer Service Call Center in the last year", "Have you had contact with a CPD police officer during the last year", "Other 2", "Do you own or rent your current residence", "Do you think you will be living in Cincinnati, Ohio, five years from now", "Which THREE of the sources from Question 2 do you MOST PREFER to use to get information about the City of Cincinnati (2nd)", "Cit4Beat", "Cincinnati Herald", "Business Courier", "Access to quality housing you can afford", "Quality of on-street bicycle infrastructure (bike\nlanes/wayfinding signs)", "Accessibility of streets, sidewalks, and buildings for people\nwith disabilities", "Snow removal on residential streets", "Snow removal on major City streets", "Condition of sidewalks in your neighborhood", "Condition of sidewalks in City", "Maintenance of city streets", "Which THREE of the major service categories of City services listed in question do you think should recieve the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years?

This dataset encompasses all fire incidents reported to NFIRS that were responded to by the Cincinnati Fire Department in the year 2019.\n\nData Creation: NFIRS was created in 1976 to address the United State\u2019s fire problem and is jointly managed by the U.S Fire Administration (USFA) and the National Fire Information Council (NFIC). Over the life of the system, all 50 states, more than 40 major metropolitan areas, and more than 15,000 fire departments have participated in NFIRS. Fore more information please visit: https://www.usfa.fema.gov/data/nfirs/about/index.html\n\nData Created By: The source of this data is the Cincinnati Fire Department.\n\nRefresh Frequency: This dataset is static and posted annually.\n\nData Dictionary: A data dictionary providing definitions of columns and attributes is available as an attachment to this dataset.\n\nProcessing: The City of Cincinnati is committed to providing the most granular and accurate data possible.
