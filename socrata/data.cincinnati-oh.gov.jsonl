The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.\n\nThe survey was administered during the winter of 2021 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was exceeded, with a total of 1,408 residents completing the survey. The overall residents for the sample of 1,408 households have a precision of at least +/-2.6% at the 95% level of confidence, and are demographically representative of our city's population.\n\nThis year's survey will set a baseline for Cincinnati to work from with the goal of better understanding where we are excelling in service delivery and where our local government could benefit from intentional improvement and resources.\n\nFind the link to the Survey landing page here:\nhttps://etcinstitute.com/directionfinder2-0/city-of-cincinnati-ohio/", "attribution": "City of Cincinnati", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-05-20T18:02:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:09.000Z", "columns_name": ["Healthy Homes/Hazard Complaints", "Vital Records Services (e.g., birth certificate, death certificate)", "Epidemiology (e.g., community dashboards, data requests,\naccess to reporting)", "Communicable Disease and Outbreak Response (e.g.,\ngeneral education, public hotline, vaccination scheduling,\ncontact tracing)", "Access and ability to interact with City Administration (City Manager, Dept.\nDirectors) regarding operational matters and public services", "Overall effectiveness of the City Administration (City Manager, Dept.\nDirectors) in management of City operations", "The City's efforts to support diversity by serving people equally regardless of\ntheir race, religion, ethnicity, age, abilities, sexual orientation, or gender\nidentity", "Elected officials conduct City business ethically", "Overall effectiveness of leadership provided by the City's elected officials", "Which THREE of the parks and recreation services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (2nd)", "Which THREE of the parks and recreation services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (1st)", "Quality of City outdoor athletic fields (e.g., baseball, soccer,\nand football)", "Quality of customer service from Recreation employees", "Other 3", "Other 4", "Would you say your total annual household income is", "What is your age?", "STATE", "ZIPCODE", "SNA_NEIGHBORHOOD", "The Recreation Department's youth programs and activities", "Ease of registering for recreation programs", "Maintenance of City swimming pools", "Maintenance of City recreation centers", "The Parks Department's youth programs and activities", "Enforcing the exterior maintenance of commercial/business property (e.g., condition of buildings)", "Which THREE of the street, sidewalk, and infrastructure services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (2nd)", "Which THREE of the street, sidewalk, and infrastructure services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (1st)", "Mowing and tree trimming along city streets and other public\nareas", "Flow of traffic on City streets in your community", "Quality of on-street bicycle infrastructure (bike\nlanes/wayfinding signs)", "Accessibility of streets, sidewalks, and buildings for people\nwith disabilities", "Snow removal on residential streets", "Snow removal on major City streets", "Condition of sidewalks in your neighborhood", "Condition of sidewalks in City", "Maintenance of city streets", "Which THREE of the major service categories of City services listed in question do you think should recieve the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years?
