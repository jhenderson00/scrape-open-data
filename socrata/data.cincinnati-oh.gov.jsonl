The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.\n\nThe survey was administered during the winter of 2021 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was exceeded, with a total of 1,408 residents completing the survey. The overall residents for the sample of 1,408 households have a precision of at least +/-2.6% at the 95% level of confidence, and are demographically representative of our city's population.\n\nThis year's survey will set a baseline for Cincinnati to work from with the goal of better understanding where we are excelling in service delivery and where our local government could benefit from intentional improvement and resources.\n\nFind the link to the Survey landing page here:\nhttps://etcinstitute.com/directionfinder2-0/city-of-cincinnati-ohio/", "attribution": "City of Cincinnati", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-05-20T18:02:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:09.000Z", "columns_name": ["Immunization Services", "CitWebsite", "Local TV News Stations", "Reporters' Social Media", "Other 1", "Fox 9", "Business Courier", "Cincinnati Herald", "Cit4Beat", "Which THREE of the sources from Question 2 do you MOST PREFER to use to get information about the City of Cincinnati (2nd)", "Do you think you will be living in Cincinnati, Ohio, five years from now", "Do you own or rent your current residence", "Other 2", "Have you had contact with a CPD police officer during the last year", "0Have you or anyone in your household contacted the City's Customer Service Call Center in the last year", "Have you visited the City's website (cincinnati-oh.gov) in the last year", "Have you used the bulky item pick-up service in the last year", "Have you or anyone in your household visited a Cincinnati, Ohio community center in the last year", "Have you used the Metro bus system in the last year", "Do you have regular access to the internet at home", "Have you ridden a bicycle on city streets or trails in the last year", "Asian/Pacific Islander", "White", "American Indian/Eskimo", "Black/African American", "Are you of Hispanic, Latino, or other Spanish ancestry", "What is your gender identity?", "Please describe your gender indenty", "CITY", "DISTRICT", "As a place to live", "As a place to raise children", "As a place to work", "As a place where I feel welcome", "Overall quality of services provided by City", "Overall value you receive for your City tax dollars & fees", "Overall quality of life in the City", "Overall feeling of safety in the City", "Physical appearance of your neighborhood", "Overall quality of the City's public transportation system", "Police services", "The maintenance of city streets, sidewalks, & infrastructure", "City water utilities", "Neighborhood services (e.g., code enforcement, property preservation, trash/recycling collection", "Health Department services", "The City's stormwater runoff/stormwater management system", "City Planning, Buildings, & Development services (e.g., issuing permits)", "Which THREE of the major service categories of City services listed in question do you think should recieve the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years?
