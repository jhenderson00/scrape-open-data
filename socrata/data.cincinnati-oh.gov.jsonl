The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.\n\nThe survey was administered during the winter of 2021 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was exceeded, with a total of 1,408 residents completing the survey. The overall residents for the sample of 1,408 households have a precision of at least +/-2.6% at the 95% level of confidence, and are demographically representative of our city's population.\n\nThis year's survey will set a baseline for Cincinnati to work from with the goal of better understanding where we are excelling in service delivery and where our local government could benefit from intentional improvement and resources.\n\nFind the link to the Survey landing page here:\nhttps://etcinstitute.com/directionfinder2-0/city-of-cincinnati-ohio/", "attribution": "City of Cincinnati", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-05-20T18:02:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:09.000Z", "columns_name": ["Overall quality of curbside recycling services", "Overall quality of trash collection services", "Demolishing vacant structures that are deemed a public nuisance", "Boarding up vacant structures that are open to entry", "Access to quality health care that you can afford", "Support for entrepreneurs and small business owners\navailable in the City", "Ability to obtain training opportunities to advance your career", "City's efforts to support minority and women-owned\nbusinesses", "Adequate quantity of affordable housing units", "Which TWO of the public health services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (2nd)", "Food Safety Programs (e.g., inspections and investigations)", "Immunization Services", "City Administration (City Manager, Dept.
