They are used by mobile operators to extend service coverage and/or increase network capacity, and are subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Small cells are typically radio equipment and antennae, and are placed on structures in high-density areas.\n\nWhile small cells can be installed in both private and public spaces, this data set only includes permits for small cell installation in the public right-of-way. These permits are regulated by the City's department of Transportation & Engineering (DOTE). In this case, \"right-of-way\" means that a \"wireless support structure\" in the right of way. This could include city-owned poles/structures; third party-owned poles/structures; or any other structure that can be modified to support small cell installation, such as a bus shelter or certain types of street sights. In this case, right-of-way refers to the location of the antenna and supporting equipment.\n\nThe purpose of small cell permits in the right of way is for the provision of wireless service to the public. The City of Cincinnati has structured the small cell permitting process to supporting early and efficient roll-out of emerging wireless technologies, while simultaneously preserving local design guidelines and respecting the character of Cincinnati neighborhoods.\n\nData Creation: This data set is collected and maintained by the Department of Transportation & Engineering (DOTE)\n\nData Created By: Department of Transportation & Engineering (DOTE)\n\nRefresh Frequency: Daily\n\nData Dictionary: A data dictionary providing definitions of columns and attributes is available as an attachment to this dataset.\n\nProcessing: The City of Cincinnati is committed to providing the most granular and accurate data possible.
