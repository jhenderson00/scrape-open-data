This community engagement tool was designed to allow the City Administration to evaluate resident satisfaction with our services and measure that level of satisfaction against cities of similar size, location, and demographics. The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.\n\nThe survey was administered during the winter of 2023 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was met, with a total of 1,235 residents completing the survey. The overall residents for the sample of 1,408 households have a precision of at least +/-2.8% at the 95% level of confidence, and are demographically representative of our city's population.\n\nThis survey provides insight into where we are excelling in service delivery and where our local government could benefit from intentional improvement and resources.\n\nRead the full report on survey results here:\nhttps://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/manager/community-survey/\n\nFind the Community Perceptions Survey Dashboard here:\nhttps://insights.cincinnati-oh.gov/stories/s/Community-Perceptions-Survey-Version-2/3nn5-m4kg/\n\nFind the 2021 Community Perceptions Survey Data here:\nhttps://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/efficient-service-delivery/Community-Perceptions-Survey-2021/pkyn-d5t4/about_data", "attribution": "City of Cincinnati", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-04-16T17:55:03.000Z", "createdAt": "2024-04-16T16:51:01.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-04-16T17:55:03.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-04-16T17:12:31.000Z", "columns_name": ["Boarding up vacant structures that are open to entry", "Which THREE of the major service categories of City services listed in question 3 do you think should recieve the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years?

This community engagement tool was designed to allow the City Administration to evaluate resident satisfaction with our services and measure that level of satisfaction against cities of similar size, location, and demographics. The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.\n\nThe survey was administered during the winter of 2021 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was exceeded, with a total of 1,408 residents completing the survey. The overall residents for the sample of 1,408 households have a precision of at least +/-2.6% at the 95% level of confidence, and are demographically representative of our city's population.\n\nThis year's survey will set a baseline for Cincinnati to work from with the goal of better understanding where we are excelling in service delivery and where our local government could benefit from intentional improvement and resources.\n\nFind the link to the Survey landing page here:\nhttps://etcinstitute.com/directionfinder2-0/city-of-cincinnati-ohio/", "attribution": "City of Cincinnati", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-04-16T17:28:36.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-05-20T18:02:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-04-16T17:28:36.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:09.000Z", "columns_name": ["Snow removal on residential streets", "Maintenance of city streets", "Condition of sidewalks in City", "Condition of sidewalks in your neighborhood", "Snow removal on major City streets", "Accessibility of streets, sidewalks, and buildings for people\nwith disabilities", "Quality of on-street bicycle infrastructure (bike\nlanes/wayfinding signs)", "Flow of traffic on City streets in your community", "Mowing and tree trimming along city streets and other public\nareas", "Which THREE of the street, sidewalk, and infrastructure services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (1st)", "Which THREE of the street, sidewalk, and infrastructure services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (2nd)", "Enforcing the exterior maintenance of commercial/business property (e.g., condition of buildings)", "Which THREE of the sources from Question 2 do you MOST PREFER to use to get information about the City of Cincinnati (1st)", "0 1", "Enquirer", "Local 2", "WCPO", "Local Newspapers", "Communications from Council Members", "0", "Other", "Which THREE of the communication and community engagement services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (3rd)", "Which THREE of the communication and community engagement services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (1st)", "Access to information about Finance and Budget information", "Access to information about Boards and Commissions meetings\n(schedules, agendas, videos)", "Access to information about City Council meetings (schedules,\nagendas, videos)", "City Administration's use of social media", "Opportunity to engage/provide input regarding City operations in public engagement opportunities provided by the City Administration", "Opportunity to engage/provide input into decisions made by Elected Officials", "Overall usefulness of City website", "Which THREE of the jobs and development services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (3rd)", "Which THREE of the jobs and development services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (2nd)", "Which THREE of the jobs and development services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (1st)", "Access to quality housing you can afford", "Access to quality mental health care that you can afford", "Access to quality child care that you can afford", "Access to job training programs", "City's use of economic development incentives to support\neconomic opportunity for residents", "Job opportunities available within the city limits", "City's efforts to attract new business and tourism", "City's efforts to fund affordable housing units", "Perception of honesty and fair dealings in development", "How well your City is managing growth", "Which TWO of the public health services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (1st)", "Healthy Homes/Hazard Complaints", "Vital Records Services (e.g., birth certificate, death certificate)", "Epidemiology (e.g., community dashboards, data requests,\naccess to reporting)", "Communicable Disease and Outbreak Response (e.g.,\ngeneral education, public hotline, vaccination scheduling,\ncontact tracing)", "As a place to retire", "Overall image of the City", "How safe you feel in your neighborhood", "Fire and ambulance services", "City parks and recreation programs/facilities", "The City's Customer Service Call Center", "The City's 911 Call Center", "Customer service you receive from City employees", "Overall effectiveness of city communication with the public", "Which THREE of the major service categories of City services listed in question do you think should recieve the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years?
