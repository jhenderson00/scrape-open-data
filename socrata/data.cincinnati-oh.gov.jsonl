The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.\n\nThe survey was administered during the winter of 2021 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was exceeded, with a total of 1,408 residents completing the survey.

This could include city-owned poles/structures; third party-owned poles/structures; or any other structure that can be modified to support small cell installation, such as a bus shelter or certain types of street sights. In this case, right-of-way refers to the location of the antenna and supporting equipment.\n\nThe purpose of small cell permits in the right of way is for the provision of wireless service to the public.
