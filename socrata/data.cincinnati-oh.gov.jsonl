The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.\n\nThe survey was administered during the winter of 2021 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was exceeded, with a total of 1,408 residents completing the survey. The overall residents for the sample of 1,408 households have a precision of at least +/-2.6% at the 95% level of confidence, and are demographically representative of our city's population.\n\nThis year's survey will set a baseline for Cincinnati to work from with the goal of better understanding where we are excelling in service delivery and where our local government could benefit from intentional improvement and resources.\n\nFind the link to the Survey landing page here:\nhttps://etcinstitute.com/directionfinder2-0/city-of-cincinnati-ohio/", "attribution": "City of Cincinnati", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-05-20T18:02:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:32.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-09-15T14:21:09.000Z", "columns_name": ["Do you think you will be living in Cincinnati, Ohio, five years from now", "Which THREE of the sources from Question 2 do you MOST PREFER to use to get information about the City of Cincinnati (2nd)", "Cit4Beat", "Cincinnati Herald", "Business Courier", "Fox 9", "Other 1", "Reporters' Social Media", "Local TV News Stations", "CitWebsite", "CitSocial Media", "CitiCable", "CitBulletin", "Email", "Nextdoor", "LinkedIn", "Instagram", "Facebook", "Twitter", "Which THREE of the communication and community engagement services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (2nd)", "Quality of the City's Open Data portal", "Access to information about Campaign finance and lobbyist\ndisclosures", "Quality of City video programming (television channel and web streaming)", "Availability of information about City programs and services", "Elected officials' efforts to support a dialogue with City residents", "Access to healthy food that you can afford", "Ease of registering for Parks programs", "Quality of facilities such as picnic shelters and playgrounds in\ncity parks", "Maintenance of City parks", "Which THREE of the neighborhood services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (3rd)", "Which THREE of the neighborhood services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (2nd)", "Which THREE of the neighborhood services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (1st)", "City efforts to clean-up illegal dumping sites", "Overall quality of leaf and brush pick-up services", "Overall quality of bulky item pick-up services", "Overall quality of curbside recycling services", "Overall quality of trash collection services", "Demolishing vacant structures that are deemed a public nuisance", "Boarding up vacant structures that are open to entry", "Access to quality health care that you can afford", "Support for entrepreneurs and small business owners\navailable in the City", "Ability to obtain training opportunities to advance your career", "City's efforts to support minority and women-owned\nbusinesses", "Adequate quantity of affordable housing units", "Which TWO of the public health services listed above do you think should receive the MOST EMPHASIS from the City over the next TWO years (2nd)", "Food Safety Programs (e.g., inspections and investigations)", "Immunization Services", "City Administration (City Manager, Dept.

This dataset encompasses all fire incidents reported to NFIRS that were responded to by the Cincinnati Fire Department in the year 2019.\n\nData Creation: NFIRS was created in 1976 to address the United State\u2019s fire problem and is jointly managed by the U.S Fire Administration (USFA) and the National Fire Information Council (NFIC). Over the life of the system, all 50 states, more than 40 major metropolitan areas, and more than 15,000 fire departments have participated in NFIRS. Fore more information please visit: https://www.usfa.fema.gov/data/nfirs/about/index.html\n\nData Created By: The source of this data is the Cincinnati Fire Department.\n\nRefresh Frequency: This dataset is static and posted annually.\n\nData Dictionary: A data dictionary providing definitions of columns and attributes is available as an attachment to this dataset.\n\nProcessing: The City of Cincinnati is committed to providing the most granular and accurate data possible.
