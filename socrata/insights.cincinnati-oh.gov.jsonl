{"resource": {"name": "Hackathon: Recycling Tip Data (2019-2022)", "id": "ygaz-erek", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Date Range: August 2019 - November 2022\n66,717 rows dropped due to incomplete data from RFID reader (2% of total rows in data set)\n\nThis data comes from RFID readers on recycling trucks that scan recycling carts which contain a unique RFID tag on each cart. Every time an RFID tag is read by the recycling truck a row is recorded in the data set. The account number in the data set is the account number that the cart belongs to. Each account number may have a varying number of carts. \n\nThe account number used by the recycling company is also an ID used in our databases for referring to addresses. In our address database each record has an account number (aka address_guid) and an addressid. The important thing to note is that some addressid's may have multiple account numbers (aka addr_guid's). For example, some condo complexes have an account number (aka addr_guid) for every unit in the complex. This does not mean that every building with multiple units will have multiple account numbers for each addressid.\n\nThe columns that contain information on the type of residence the address is have data that was pulled in November 2022. This may have implications when looking at historical data structure types. For example, an account number was a one family dwelling in 2019 but remodeled and reclassified as a 4-family dwelling in 2022. The records where this is the case however should be small.\n\nThe dataset contains tips from all recycling accounts, so commercial and municipal account tips will also appear in the dataset. This will need to be accounted for when analyzing and filters may need to be applied to look at specific groups such as residential single family dwellings.\n \nColumn Info:\nADDR_TYPE:\nADR = Address\nBLD = Building\nPAR = Parcel\nCON = CONDO\n\nCategory:\nSpecifies if the address is classified as \"Residential\" or \"Commercial\" use for example.\n\nDescription:\nA more granular description of the address for example Category could be \"Residential\" and Description could be \"Single Family Dwelling\"", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-04-20T13:04:57.000Z", "createdAt": "2023-03-17T23:01:11.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-04-20T13:04:57.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-04-19T21:13:26.000Z", "columns_name": ["COLLECTION_ROUTE_NUMBER", "ASSET_SERIAL_TIPPED", "CONTAINER_RFID_TIPPED", "RF_PRODUCT_SIZE", "TIP_LATITUDE", "TIP_LONGITUDE", "TRUCK_NUMBER", "CATEGORY", "DESCRIPTION", "SNA_NEIGHBORHOOD", "ADDRTYPE", "ADDRESSID", "TIP_DATE_TIME", "RF_SERVICE_TYPE", "ADDRESS_GEOCODED", "ACCOUNT_NUMBER"], "columns_field_name": ["collection_route_number", "asset_serial_tipped", "container_rfid_tipped", "rf_product_size", "tip_latitude", "tip_longitude", "truck_number", "category", "description", "sna_neighborhood", "addrtype", "addressid", "tip_date_time", "rf_service_type", "address_geocoded", "account_number"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Point", "Text"], "columns_description": ["The collection route number identifier that the tip was a part of.", "The serial number of the cart that was read by the recycling truck.
