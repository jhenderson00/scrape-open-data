{"resource": {"name": "Grain Basis", "id": "v85y-3hep", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Basis reflects both local and global supply and demand forces. It is calculated as the difference between the local cash price and the futures price. It affects when and where many grain producers and shippers buy and sell grain. Many factors affect basis\u2014such as local supplies, storage and transportation availability, and global demand\u2014and they interact in complex ways. How changes in basis manifest in transportation is likewise complex and not always direct. For instance, an increase in current demand will drive cash prices up relative to future prices, and increase basis. At the same time, grain will enter the transportation system to fulfill that demand. However, grain supplies also affect basis, but will have the opposite effect on transportation. During harvest, the increase in the supply of grain pushes down cash prices relative to futures prices, and basis weakens, but the demand for transportation increases to move the supplies.\n\nFor more information on how basis is linked to transportation, see the story, \"Grain Prices, Basis, and Transportation\" (https://agtransport.usda.gov/stories/s/sjmk-tkh6), and links below for research on the topic.\n\nThis data has corn, soybean, and wheat basis for a variety of locations.

USDA's Export Sales Reporting Program monitors U.S. agricultural export sales on a daily and weekly basis. Export sales reporting provides a constant stream of up-to-date market information for 40 U.S. agricultural commodities sold abroad. A single statistic reveals the significance of the program: in a typical year, the program monitors more than 40 percent of total U.S. agricultural exports. The program also serves as an early alert on the possible impact foreign sales have on U.S. supplies and prices. The weekly U.S. Export Sales report is the most current available source of U.S. export sales data. The data is used to analyze the overall level of export demand, determine where markets exist, and assess the relative position of U.S. commodities in foreign markets.\n\nThe date field in export sales is weekly, based on the calendar year. However, the dataset also keeps track of marketing year export sales. Be cautious when aggregating the export sales data over the date variable to properly account for these factors.\n\nThe turn of the marketing year often falls on a different day of the week then the weekly calendar year reporting. In this case, FAS adds an additional row (two total) to the dataset for that calendar week. One row represents that week's values which fell in the previous marketing year, while the other row captures that week's values which fell in the new marketing year. The \"Marketing Year Start or End\" variable labels these rows as \"ENDING MY\" and \"STARTING MY\", respectively, and is otherwise empty.\n\nThis creates a double counting issue when aggregating some of the variables by calendar week. See our view, https://agtransport.usda.gov/d/885i-uek7, for an example of avoiding double counting to show total outstanding sales over time.", "attribution": "USDA Foreign Agricultural Service", "attribution_link": "https://apps.fas.usda.gov", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-02-27T18:45:34.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-11-01T21:47:46.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-02-27T18:45:33.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-27T18:45:34.000Z", "columns_name": ["Year", "Net Sales, Total", "Unit", "Marketing Year Start or End", "Commodity", "Marketing Month", "Total Commitments CMY", "Date", "Net Sales CMY", "Weekly Exports CMY", "Commodity Type", "Marketing Year", "Net Sales NMY", "Accumulated Exports CMY", "Outstanding Sales, Total", "Gross Sales CMY", "Country", "Month", "Outstanding Sales CMY", "Week", "Outstanding Sales NMY"], "columns_field_name": ["year", "net_sales_total", "unit", "my", "commodity", "marketingmonth", "totcommcmy", "date", "netsalescmy", "wkexportscmy", "type", "myear", "netsalesnmy", "accexportscmy", "outstanding_sales_total", "grosalescmy", "country", "month", "outsalescmy", "week", "outsalesnmy"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Year number calculated from the reported week ending date (Date field).
