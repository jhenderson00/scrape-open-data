The seven locations are: (1) \"Twin Cities,\" a stretch along the Upper Mississippi; (2) \"Mid-Mississippi,\" a stretch between eastern Iowa and western Illinois; (3) \"Illinois River,\" along the lower portion of the Illinois River; (4) \"St. Louis\"; (5) \"Cincinnati,\" along the middle third of the Ohio River; (6) \"Lower Ohio,\" approximately the final third of the Ohio River; and (7) \"Cairo-Memphis,\" from Cairo, IL, to Memphis, TN (see map under Attachments).\n\nThe U.S. Inland Waterway System utilizes a percent-of-tariff system to establish barge freight rates. The tariffs were originally from the Bulk Grain and Grain Products Freight Tariff No. 7, which were issued by the Waterways Freight Bureau (WFB) of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). In 1976, the United States Department of Justice entered into an agreement with the ICC and made Tariff No. 7 no longer applicable. Today, the WFB no longer exists, and the ICC has become the Surface Transportation Board, which does not have jurisdiction over barge rates on the inland waterways. However, the barge industry continues to use the tariffs as benchmarks for rate units.\n\nEach city on the river has its own benchmark, with the northern most cities having the highest benchmarks. They are as follows: Twin Cities = 619; Mid-Mississippi = 532; St. Louis = 399; Illinois = 464; Cincinnati = 469; Lower Ohio = 446; and Cairo-Memphis = 314.\n\nTo calculate the rate in dollars per ton, multiply the percent of tariff rate by the 1976 benchmark and divide by 100: (Rate * 1976 tariff benchmark rate per ton)/100.

{"resource": {"name": "Secondary Railcar Auction Market Bids", "id": "cvu8-kpyk", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This dataset contains average weekly bids/offers ($/car) among grain shippers in the \"secondary railcar auction market\" for guaranteed rail freight in near and future months. Railroads auction freight in the \"primary railcar auction market,\" and grain shippers can trade this freight among themselves in the secondary railcar auction market.\n\nThese railcar markets evolved to enable rail movements of grain to be more responsive to market pressures. Published tariff rates tend to reflect the most likely market conditions to prevail given historical precedence and future expectations; railroads adjust many of their tariff rates only once or twice per year in order to set longer term prices that account for their fixed assets and optimize their networks. Furthermore, railroads are required by law to give a 20-day notice prior to changing tariffs. Therefore, rail rates are more insulated than other modes from weekly market changes and unexpected events, including weather or transportation service disruptions. But in the short term, as new information enters the market, the optimal allocation of railcar supply with shipper demand may no longer be most efficiently allocated by the prices set by tariff rates alone. This was a characteristic of rail service prior to the late 1980\u2019s when service was priced at the tariff rate and available on a first-come-first-served basis.\n\nForward-guaranteed railcar service contracts were an innovation first offered by railroads in the late 1980\u2019s. These contracts offer guaranteed railcar deliveries within a specific time frame and serve as instruments against risk caused by unexpected events. They allow the supply of railcars to be continually reallocated among shippers through an auction bidding process as new information comes into the market, providing an alternative to first-come-first-served service purchased through tariff rates. There are two types of railcar auction markets\u2014the primary market, in which service contracts are originally sold by railroads to shippers, and the secondary market, in which shippers resell service contracts among themselves. Sales in the primary market are administered by the railroads; sales in the secondary market are administered by third-party brokers.\n\nFor more information on this markets, see the feature article in the February 19, 2015 Grain Transportation Report (link provided below).", "attribution": "USDA-AMS", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-06-20T16:30:40.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-10-25T18:23:42.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-06-20T16:30:37.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-06-20T16:30:40.000Z", "columns_name": ["Year-Month Bid For", "Date", "Year", "Train_Type", "Company", "Month", "Month Bid For", "Bid", "Near-Month Indicator", "Year Bid For", "Week"], "columns_field_name": ["year_month_bid_for", "date", "year", "train_type", "company", "month", "month_bid_on", "bid", "near_month", "year_bid_on", "week"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Checkbox", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "Week ending date, ranging from 1997 to the present.", "Year number calculated from the reported week ending date (Date field).

{"resource": {"name": "Downbound Grain Barge Rates", "id": "deqi-uken", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Weekly barge rates for downbound freight originating from seven locations along the Mississippi River System, which includes the Mississippi River and its tributaries (e.g., Upper Mississippi River, Illinois River, Ohio River, etc.). The seven locations are: (1) \"Twin Cities,\" a stretch along the Upper Mississippi; (2) \"Mid-Mississippi,\" a stretch between eastern Iowa and western Illinois; (3) \"Illinois River,\" along the lower portion of the Illinois River; (4) \"St. Louis\"; (5) \"Cincinnati,\" along the middle third of the Ohio River; (6) \"Lower Ohio,\" approximately the final third of the Ohio River; and (7) \"Cairo-Memphis,\" from Cairo, IL, to Memphis, TN (see map under Attachments).\n\nThe U.S. Inland Waterway System utilizes a percent-of-tariff system to establish barge freight rates. The tariffs were originally from the Bulk Grain and Grain Products Freight Tariff No. 7, which were issued by the Waterways Freight Bureau (WFB) of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). In 1976, the United States Department of Justice entered into an agreement with the ICC and made Tariff No. 7 no longer applicable. Today, the WFB no longer exists, and the ICC has become the Surface Transportation Board, which does not have jurisdiction over barge rates on the inland waterways. However, the barge industry continues to use the tariffs as benchmarks for rate units.\n\nEach city on the river has its own benchmark, with the northern most cities having the highest benchmarks. They are as follows: Twin Cities = 619; Mid-Mississippi = 532; St. Louis = 399; Illinois = 464; Cincinnati = 469; Lower Ohio = 446; and Cairo-Memphis = 314.\n\nTo calculate the rate in dollars per ton, multiply the percent of tariff rate by the 1976 benchmark and divide by 100: (Rate * 1976 tariff benchmark rate per ton)/100.

Note, however, that this data does not include all grain barge movements on the Mississippi Rover System, as some grain originates on the Mississippi below the locking portion (south of St. Louis, MO).

{"resource": {"name": "Grain Basis", "id": "v85y-3hep", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Basis reflects both local and global supply and demand forces. It is calculated as the difference between the local cash price and the futures price. It affects when and where many grain producers and shippers buy and sell grain. Many factors affect basis\u2014such as local supplies, storage and transportation availability, and global demand\u2014and they interact in complex ways. How changes in basis manifest in transportation is likewise complex and not always direct. For instance, an increase in current demand will drive cash prices up relative to future prices, and increase basis. At the same time, grain will enter the transportation system to fulfill that demand. However, grain supplies also affect basis, but will have the opposite effect on transportation. During harvest, the increase in the supply of grain pushes down cash prices relative to futures prices, and basis weakens, but the demand for transportation increases to move the supplies.\n\nFor more information on how basis is linked to transportation, see the story, \"Grain Prices, Basis, and Transportation\" (https://agtransport.usda.gov/stories/s/sjmk-tkh6), and links below for research on the topic.\n\nThis data has corn, soybean, and wheat basis for a variety of locations. These include origins\u2014such as Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and many others\u2014and destinations, such as the Pacific Northwest, Louisiana Gulf, Texas Gulf, and Atlantic Coast.\n\nThis is one of three companion datasets. The other two are grain prices (https://agtransport.usda.gov/d/g92w-8cn7) and grain price spreads (https://agtransport.usda.gov/d/an4w-mnp7). These datasets are separate, because the coverage lengths differ and missing values are removed (e.g., there needs to be a cash price and a futures price to have a basis price).\n\nThe cash price comes from the grain prices dataset and the futures price comes from the appropriate futures market, which is Chicago Board of Trade (CME Group) for corn, soybeans, and soft red winter wheat; Kansas City Board of Trade (CME Group) for hard red winter wheat; and the Minneapolis Grain Exchange for hard red spring wheat.", "attribution": "USDA-AMS", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-06-20T16:32:24.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-05-20T19:35:22.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-06-20T16:32:19.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-06-20T16:32:24.000Z", "columns_name": ["Bid", "Market Name", "Market Type", "Basis", "Commodity", "Year", "Date", "Longitude", "Futures Price", "Source", "Month", "Location", "Latitude", "Week", "Nearby Futures Month"], "columns_field_name": ["bid", "market_name", "market_type", "basis", "commodity", "year", "date", "longitude", "futures_price", "source", "month", "geocoded_column", "latitude", "week", "contract_month"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Point", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["The price in dollars per bushel.", "The name of the location (e.g., Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Ohio, Pacific Northwest, etc.).", "Either \"Elevator Bid\" (which reflects origins) or \"30-Day to Arrive\" (which reflect destinations).", "The difference between the Bid field and the Futures Price field.", "The commodity: corn, soybeans, hard red winter wheat, hard red spring wheat, and soft red winter wheat.", "Year number calculated from the reported week ending date (Date field).

USDA's Export Sales Reporting Program monitors U.S. agricultural export sales on a daily and weekly basis. Export sales reporting provides a constant stream of up-to-date market information for 40 U.S. agricultural commodities sold abroad. A single statistic reveals the significance of the program: in a typical year, the program monitors more than 40 percent of total U.S. agricultural exports. The program also serves as an early alert on the possible impact foreign sales have on U.S. supplies and prices. The weekly U.S. Export Sales report is the most current available source of U.S. export sales data. The data is used to analyze the overall level of export demand, determine where markets exist, and assess the relative position of U.S. commodities in foreign markets.\n\nThe date field in export sales is weekly, based on the calendar year. However, the dataset also keeps track of marketing year export sales. Be cautious when aggregating the export sales data over the date variable to properly account for these factors.\n\nThe turn of the marketing year often falls on a different day of the week then the weekly calendar year reporting. In this case, FAS adds an additional row (two total) to the dataset for that calendar week. One row represents that week's values which fell in the previous marketing year, while the other row captures that week's values which fell in the new marketing year. The \"Marketing Year Start or End\" variable labels these rows as \"ENDING MY\" and \"STARTING MY\", respectively, and is otherwise empty.\n\nThis creates a double counting issue when aggregating some of the variables by calendar week.

Then, in December 2023, TURN underwent a major upgrade. The new TURN report (https://agtransport.usda.gov/stories/s/wu88-46by), now updated weekly, makes agricultural transportation news more accessible and timelier, replacing the prior, quarterly, PDF-based version.\n\nThis dataset contains the historical news entries (from January 2023 on) for TURN. These entries showcase the news about industrial developments and trends\u2014as well as Federal and State regulatory policy affecting all modes of agricultural transportation. The dataset also alerts readers to transportation research that is relevant to agricultural stakeholders\u2014including research by Federal and State governments, universities, and trade associations.\n\nAs shown in the column metadata below, the dataset contains multiple fields (e.g., \"mode,\" \"commodity,\" and \"type\"), which you can use to find the news relevant to your interests.
