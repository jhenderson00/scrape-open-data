Mathematically, it is the destination price minus the origin price.\n\nPrice spreads are closely linked to transportation. They tend to reflect the costs of moving goods from one point to another, all else constant. Fluctuations in spreads can change the flow of goods (where it may be more profitable to ship to a different location), as well as indicate changes in transportation availability (e.g., disruptions). For more information on how price spreads are linked to transportation, see the story, \"Grain Prices, Basis, and Transportation\" (https://agtransport.usda.gov/stories/s/sjmk-tkh6).\n\nThis is one of three companion datasets. The other two are grain prices (https://agtransport.usda.gov/d/g92w-8cn7) and grain basis (https://agtransport.usda.gov/d/v85y-3hep). These datasets are separate, because the coverage lengths differ and missing values are removed (e.g., there needs to be a cash price and a futures price to have a basis price, and there needs to be both an origin and a destination to have a price spread).\n\nThe origin and destination prices come from the grain prices dataset.", "attribution": "USDA AMS", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-12-21T20:17:26.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-05-22T18:30:53.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-12-21T20:17:20.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-12-21T20:17:26.000Z", "columns_name": ["Destination Latitude", "Week", "Month", "Commodity", "Origin Bid", "Destination Bid", "Date", "Destination Name", "Year", "Origin Longitude", "Origin Latitude", "Origin-Destination", "Price Spread", "OD Line", "Destination Longitude", "Origin Name"], "columns_field_name": ["destination_lat", "week", "month", "commodity", "origin_bid", "destination_bid", "date", "destination", "year", "origin_lon", "origin_lat", "origin_destination", "price_spread", "od_line", "destination_lon", "origin"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Line", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["The latitude of the destination.", "Week number calculated from the reported week ending date (Date field).

{"resource": {"name": "Secondary Railcar Auction Market Bids", "id": "cvu8-kpyk", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This dataset contains average weekly bids/offers ($/car) among grain shippers in the \"secondary railcar auction market\" for guaranteed rail freight in near and future months. Railroads auction freight in the \"primary railcar auction market,\" and grain shippers can trade this freight among themselves in the secondary railcar auction market.\n\nThese railcar markets evolved to enable rail movements of grain to be more responsive to market pressures. Published tariff rates tend to reflect the most likely market conditions to prevail given historical precedence and future expectations; railroads adjust many of their tariff rates only once or twice per year in order to set longer term prices that account for their fixed assets and optimize their networks. Furthermore, railroads are required by law to give a 20-day notice prior to changing tariffs. Therefore, rail rates are more insulated than other modes from weekly market changes and unexpected events, including weather or transportation service disruptions. But in the short term, as new information enters the market, the optimal allocation of railcar supply with shipper demand may no longer be most efficiently allocated by the prices set by tariff rates alone. This was a characteristic of rail service prior to the late 1980\u2019s when service was priced at the tariff rate and available on a first-come-first-served basis.\n\nForward-guaranteed railcar service contracts were an innovation first offered by railroads in the late 1980\u2019s. These contracts offer guaranteed railcar deliveries within a specific time frame and serve as instruments against risk caused by unexpected events. They allow the supply of railcars to be continually reallocated among shippers through an auction bidding process as new information comes into the market, providing an alternative to first-come-first-served service purchased through tariff rates. There are two types of railcar auction markets\u2014the primary market, in which service contracts are originally sold by railroads to shippers, and the secondary market, in which shippers resell service contracts among themselves. Sales in the primary market are administered by the railroads; sales in the secondary market are administered by third-party brokers.\n\nFor more information on this markets, see the feature article in the February 19, 2015 Grain Transportation Report (link provided below).", "attribution": "USDA-AMS", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-12-21T20:38:45.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-10-25T18:23:42.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-12-21T20:38:44.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-12-21T20:38:45.000Z", "columns_name": ["Month Bid For", "Week", "Year", "Year-Month Bid For", "Company", "Month", "Train_Type", "Bid", "Date", "Year Bid For"], "columns_field_name": ["month_bid_on", "week", "year", "year_month_bid_for", "company", "month", "train_type", "bid", "date", "year_bid_on"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Month for delivery of railcars.", "Week number calculated from the reported week ending date (Date field).

The tariffs were originally from the Bulk Grain and Grain Products Freight Tariff No. 7, which were issued by the Waterways Freight Bureau (WFB) of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). In 1976, the United States Department of Justice entered into an agreement with the ICC and made Tariff No. 7 no longer applicable.

However, the barge industry continues to use the tariffs as benchmarks for rate units.\n\nEach city on the river has its own benchmark, with the northern most cities having the highest benchmarks.

Note, however, that this data does not include all grain barge movements on the Mississippi Rover System, as some grain originates on the Mississippi below the locking portion (south of St. Louis, MO).

This dataset contains rates for transactions one month in the future.\n\nThe seven locations are: (1) \"Twin Cities,\" a stretch along the Upper Mississippi; (2) \"Mid-Mississippi,\" a stretch between eastern Iowa and western Illinois; (3) \"Illinois River,\" along the lower portion of the Illinois River; (4) \"St. Louis\"; (5) \"Cincinnati,\" along the middle third of the Ohio River; (6) \"Lower Ohio,\" approximately the final third of the Ohio River; and (7) \"Cairo-Memphis,\" from Cairo, IL, to Memphis, TN.\n\nThe U.S. Inland Waterway System utilizes a percent-of-tariff system to establish barge freight rates. The tariffs were originally from the Bulk Grain and Grain Products Freight Tariff No. 7, which were issued by the Waterways Freight Bureau (WFB) of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). In 1976, the United States Department of Justice entered into an agreement with the ICC and made Tariff No. 7 no longer applicable. Today, the WFB no longer exists, and the ICC has become the Surface Transportation Board, which does not have jurisdiction over barge rates on the inland waterways.

{"resource": {"name": "Grain Basis", "id": "v85y-3hep", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Basis reflects both local and global supply and demand forces. It is calculated as the difference between the local cash price and the futures price. It affects when and where many grain producers and shippers buy and sell grain. Many factors affect basis\u2014such as local supplies, storage and transportation availability, and global demand\u2014and they interact in complex ways. How changes in basis manifest in transportation is likewise complex and not always direct. For instance, an increase in current demand will drive cash prices up relative to future prices, and increase basis. At the same time, grain will enter the transportation system to fulfill that demand. However, grain supplies also affect basis, but will have the opposite effect on transportation. During harvest, the increase in the supply of grain pushes down cash prices relative to futures prices, and basis weakens, but the demand for transportation increases to move the supplies.\n\nFor more information on how basis is linked to transportation, see the story, \"Grain Prices, Basis, and Transportation\" (https://agtransport.usda.gov/stories/s/sjmk-tkh6), and links below for research on the topic.\n\nThis data has corn, soybean, and wheat basis for a variety of locations.

USDA's Export Sales Reporting Program monitors U.S. agricultural export sales on a daily and weekly basis. Export sales reporting provides a constant stream of up-to-date market information for 40 U.S. agricultural commodities sold abroad. A single statistic reveals the significance of the program: in a typical year, the program monitors more than 40 percent of total U.S. agricultural exports. The program also serves as an early alert on the possible impact foreign sales have on U.S. supplies and prices. The weekly U.S. Export Sales report is the most current available source of U.S. export sales data. The data is used to analyze the overall level of export demand, determine where markets exist, and assess the relative position of U.S. commodities in foreign markets.\n\nThe date field in export sales is weekly, based on the calendar year. However, the dataset also keeps track of marketing year export sales. Be cautious when aggregating the export sales data over the date variable to properly account for these factors.\n\nThe turn of the marketing year often falls on a different day of the week then the weekly calendar year reporting. In this case, FAS adds an additional row (two total) to the dataset for that calendar week. One row represents that week's values which fell in the previous marketing year, while the other row captures that week's values which fell in the new marketing year. The \"Marketing Year Start or End\" variable labels these rows as \"ENDING MY\" and \"STARTING MY\", respectively, and is otherwise empty.\n\nThis creates a double counting issue when aggregating some of the variables by calendar week.
