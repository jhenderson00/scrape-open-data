Then, in December 2023, TURN underwent a major upgrade. The new TURN report (https://agtransport.usda.gov/stories/s/wu88-46by), now updated weekly, makes agricultural transportation news more accessible and timelier, replacing the prior, quarterly, PDF-based version.\n\nThis dataset contains the historical news entries (from January 2023 on) for TURN. These entries showcase the news about industrial developments and trends\u2014as well as Federal and State regulatory policy affecting all modes of agricultural transportation. The dataset also alerts readers to transportation research that is relevant to agricultural stakeholders\u2014including research by Federal and State governments, universities, and trade associations.\n\nAs shown in the column metadata below, the dataset contains multiple fields (e.g., \"mode,\" \"commodity,\" and \"type\"), which you can use to find the news relevant to your interests.
