This dataset shows rates for transactions three months in the future.\n\nThe U.S. Inland Waterway System utilizes a percent-of-tariff system to establish barge freight rates. The tariffs were originally from the Bulk Grain and Grain Products Freight Tariff No. 7, which were issued by the Waterways Freight Bureau (WFB) of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). In 1976, the United States Department of Justice entered into an agreement with the ICC and made Tariff No. 7 no longer applicable. Today, the WFB no longer exists, and the ICC has become the Surface Transportation Board, which does not have jurisdiction over barge rates on the inland waterways. However, the barge industry continues to use the tariffs as benchmarks for rate units.\n\nEach city on the river has its own benchmark, with the northern most cities having the highest benchmarks. They are as follows: Twin Cities = 619; Mid-Mississippi = 532; St. Louis = 399; Illinois = 464; Cincinnati = 469; Lower Ohio = 446; and Cairo-Memphis = 314.\n\nTo calculate the rate in dollars per ton, multiply the percent of tariff rate by the 1976 benchmark and divide by 100: (Rate * 1976 tariff benchmark rate per ton)/100.

It is calculated as the difference between the local cash price and the futures price. It affects when and where many grain producers and shippers buy and sell grain. Many factors affect basis\u2014such as local supplies, storage and transportation availability, and global demand\u2014and they interact in complex ways. How changes in basis manifest in transportation is likewise complex and not always direct. For instance, an increase in current demand will drive cash prices up relative to future prices, and increase basis. At the same time, grain will enter the transportation system to fulfill that demand. However, grain supplies also affect basis, but will have the opposite effect on transportation. During harvest, the increase in the supply of grain pushes down cash prices relative to futures prices, and basis weakens, but the demand for transportation increases to move the supplies.\n\nFor more information on how basis is linked to transportation, see the story, \"Grain Prices, Basis, and Transportation\" (https://agtransport.usda.gov/stories/s/sjmk-tkh6), and links below for research on the topic.\n\nThis data has corn, soybean, and wheat basis for a variety of locations.

USDA's Export Sales Reporting Program monitors U.S. agricultural export sales on a daily and weekly basis. Export sales reporting provides a constant stream of up-to-date market information for 40 U.S. agricultural commodities sold abroad. A single statistic reveals the significance of the program: in a typical year, the program monitors more than 40 percent of total U.S. agricultural exports. The program also serves as an early alert on the possible impact foreign sales have on U.S. supplies and prices. The weekly U.S. Export Sales report is the most current available source of U.S. export sales data. The data is used to analyze the overall level of export demand, determine where markets exist, and assess the relative position of U.S. commodities in foreign markets.\n\nThe date field in export sales is weekly, based on the calendar year. However, the dataset also keeps track of marketing year export sales. Be cautious when aggregating the export sales data over the date variable to properly account for these factors.\n\nThe turn of the marketing year often falls on a different day of the week then the weekly calendar year reporting. In this case, FAS adds an additional row (two total) to the dataset for that calendar week. One row represents that week's values which fell in the previous marketing year, while the other row captures that week's values which fell in the new marketing year. The \"Marketing Year Start or End\" variable labels these rows as \"ENDING MY\" and \"STARTING MY\", respectively, and is otherwise empty.\n\nThis creates a double counting issue when aggregating some of the variables by calendar week.

{"resource": {"name": "Transportation Updates and Regulatory News", "id": "yqrm-f7hp", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "In May 2016, USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) first launched its quarterly Transportation Updates and Regulatory News (TURN) report, highlighting government-regulatory and industry news about agricultural transportation. Then, in December 2023, TURN underwent a major upgrade. The new TURN report (https://agtransport.usda.gov/stories/s/wu88-46by), now updated weekly, makes agricultural transportation news more accessible and timelier, replacing the prior, quarterly, PDF-based version.\n\nThis dataset contains the historical news entries (from January 2023 on) for TURN. These entries showcase the news about industrial developments and trends\u2014as well as Federal and State regulatory policy affecting all modes of agricultural transportation. The dataset also alerts readers to transportation research that is relevant to agricultural stakeholders\u2014including research by Federal and State governments, universities, and trade associations.\n\nAs shown in the column metadata below, the dataset contains multiple fields (e.g., \"mode,\" \"commodity,\" and \"type\"), which you can use to find the news relevant to your interests. Hyperlinks for more or related information are included, where possible, in additional columns. Although the hyperlinks are correct and current when each news item first appears, many links become broken or obsolete over time. The hyperlinks are provided for convenience and informational purposes only; they do not constitute an endorsement or an approval by USDA or AMS. USDA or AMS bears no responsibility for the accuracy, legality, or content of websites external to USDA.\n\nFor older news (i.e., before January 2023), see the TURN report archive page: https://www.ams.usda.gov/rules-regulations/transportation/turn-archive.", "attribution": "USDA-AMS", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-01-18T17:57:08.000Z", "createdAt": "2023-12-01T21:19:43.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-01-18T17:57:07.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-01-18T17:57:08.000Z", "columns_name": ["Description", "News Link 5", "News Link 1", "News Link 2", "News Link 3", "News Link 4", "Mode", "Item Type", "Title", "Commodity", "News Date", "GTR Publish Date"], "columns_field_name": ["description", "news_link_5", "news_link_1", "news_link_2", "news_link_3", "news_link_4", "mode", "item_type", "title", "commodity", "news_date", "gtr_publish_date"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "URL", "URL", "URL", "URL", "URL", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Calendar date"], "columns_description": ["The news entry--a paragraph summary of the news/regulation/etc.", "If applicable, the fifth link related to the news item.", "If applicable, the first link related to the news item.", "If applicable, the second link related to the news item.", "If applicable, the third link related to the news item.", "If applicable, the fourth link related to the news item.", "The mode(s) applicable to the news item (e.g., \"Barge,\" \"Rail,\" \"Truck,\" \"Ocean,\" \"Multimodal,\" etc.).", "The type of the news content (e.g., \"News,\" \"Data Highlight,\" \"Proposed Rule,\" \"Final Rule,\" \"Regulations,\" etc.).", "A short synopsis of the news item.", "The commodity applicable to the news item (e.g., \"Grains,\" \"Biofuels,\" \"Fertilizer,\" \"General\" commodities, etc.).", "If available, date of the news item, press release, article, etc.", "If applicable, the date the news item was published in USDA-AMS's weekly Grain Transportation Report."], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"view": "date"}, {"view": "date"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2023-12-06T04:17:30.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["news", "regulations"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Scope_Temporal-Unit", "value": "Day"}, {"key": "Scope_Temporal-Coverage", "value": "January 2023 to present"}, {"key": "Publishing_Publishing-Schedule", "value": "Weekly"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "internal.agtransport.usda.gov"}, "permalink": "https://internal.agtransport.usda.gov/d/yqrm-f7hp", "link": "https://internal.agtransport.usda.gov/dataset/Transportation-Updates-and-Regulatory-News/yqrm-f7hp", "owner": {"id": "ga9v-zrtn", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kranti Mulik"}, "creator": {"id": "ga9v-zrtn", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Kranti Mulik"}}
