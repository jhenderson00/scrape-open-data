This dataset includes initial reports that may be subject to change through the review process.  This dataset reflects the most current status and information of these reports.  This dataset includes one row of data for each use of force incident, with information about the officers and subjects involved flattented into the incident row.  That is, the officer and subject-specific columns will contain information about all the officers and subjects, joined by the \"|\" character.  For example, if during a use of force incident two officers used force and three people were the subject of force, the, \"Officer Age\" column might contain \"43 | 27\", while the \"Subject Age\" column might contain \"27 | 26 | 31\".  For all officer and subject columns, the data are in the same order, so the first age shown in \"Officer Age\" matches the first entry in \"Officer Gender\", and the same applies to the subject-specific fields.The officer-specific fields that may contain multiple values are: Officer Race/Ethnicity, Officer Gender, Officer Age, Officer years of service, Use of Force Level, Use of Force Type, Use of Force Effective, and Officer Injured.The subject-specific fields that may contain multiple values are: Subject Gender, Subject Ethnicity, Subject Age, Subject Distance from Officer, Subject Build, Subject Height, Subject Injured, Subject Hospitalized, Subject Arrested, Subject Arrest Charges, and Subject Influencing Factors.The number of rows in this dataset does not represent the number of times force was used by NOPD officers.
