Unlike the every-10-year census, the ACS survey continues all year, every year by randomly sampling addresses in every state, thus creating a \u201crolling average\u201d of data about designated geographic regions to generate up-to-date statistics used by many federal, state, tribal, and local leaders. The U.S. decennial census is to provides counts of people for the purpose of Congressional apportionment, the ACS measures the changing social and economic characteristics of the U.S. population. The ACS does not provide official counts of the population in between censuses. Some American Community Survey questions have been asked by the census since it first began in 1790. Because ACS data are collected continuously, they are not always comparable to data collected from the decennial census. For example, in the case of employment statistics, both surveys ask about employment status during the week prior to the survey. However, data from the decennial census are typically collected between March and August, whereas data from the ACS are collected each month and reflect employment throughout the year. Differences in these responses may in turn affect data on commuting, occupation, and industry. It is anticipated that the short form (age, gender, race) will continue to be distributed to all households every 10 years. A major advantage of the ACS is ensuring communities with residents in group housing get a fair share of federal funds. Group housing facilities (also called \"group quarters\") are randomly selected throughout the year depending on the size of your facility. It is the extra attention to detail that reduces some of the common and seemingly unavoidable errors generated by the previous long form.

The TCAP is collaboratively developed by the Colorado Department of Education, the Colorado teaching community and CTB/McGraw-Hill.", "attribution": "Colorado Department of Education",

These structures include all reservoirs built after April 17, 1941, on watercourses which the state engineer has determined to be \"normally dry\" and having a capacity of not more than ten acre-feet and a vertical height not exceeding fifteen feet from the bottom of the channel to the bottom of the spillway. Again, as with erosion control dams, the height is measured from the lowest point of the upstream toe to the crest of the spillway. No livestock water tanks can be used for irrigation purposes.\r\nErosion control dams are governed under Colorado statute (see section 37-87-122, C.R.S. (1990). These types of structures may be constructed on water courses which have been determined by the state engineer to be normally dry (which for our purposes is dry more than 80% of the time). Structures of this type cannot exceed fifteen feet from the bottom of the channel to the bottom of the spillway and cannot exceed ten acre-feet at the emergency spillway level.

Overcounts are known to exist in student and dual-residence populations, while undercounts are a given for homeless and illegal immigrants. Errors arise from both sampling and non-sampling methods. Sampling errors are misrepresentations of a larger population based on the selection of the representative sample. Accuracy of the estimates depend in part on how typical the people within the sampled housing units are to others within their area. The Census estimates sampling error based on the population and its extent of variability.

Unlike the every-10-year census, the ACS survey continues all year, every year by randomly sampling addresses in every state, thus creating a \u201crolling average\u201d of data about designated geographic regions to generate up-to-date statistics used by many federal, state, tribal, and local leaders. The U.S. decennial census is to provides counts of people for the purpose of Congressional apportionment, the ACS measures the changing social and economic characteristics of the U.S. population. The ACS does not provide official counts of the population in between censuses. Some American Community Survey questions have been asked by the census since it first began in 1790. Because ACS data are collected continuously, they are not always comparable to data collected from the decennial census. For example, in the case of employment statistics, both surveys ask about employment status during the week prior to the survey. However, data from the decennial census are typically collected between March and August, whereas data from the ACS are collected each month and reflect employment throughout the year. Differences in these responses may in turn affect data on commuting, occupation, and industry. It is anticipated that the short form (age, gender, race) will continue to be distributed to all households every 10 years. A major advantage of the ACS is ensuring communities with residents in group housing get a fair share of federal funds. Group housing facilities (also called \"group quarters\") are randomly selected throughout the year depending on the size of your facility. It is the extra attention to detail that reduces some of the common and seemingly unavoidable errors generated by the previous long form.

Unlike the every-10-year census, the ACS survey continues all year, every year by randomly sampling addresses in every state, thus creating a \u201crolling average\u201d of data about designated geographic regions to generate up-to-date statistics used by many federal, state, tribal, and local leaders. The U.S. decennial census is to provides counts of people for the purpose of Congressional apportionment, the ACS measures the changing social and economic characteristics of the U.S. population. The ACS does not provide official counts of the population in between censuses. Some American Community Survey questions have been asked by the census since it first began in 1790. Because ACS data are collected continuously, they are not always comparable to data collected from the decennial census. For example, in the case of employment statistics, both surveys ask about employment status during the week prior to the survey. However, data from the decennial census are typically collected between March and August, whereas data from the ACS are collected each month and reflect employment throughout the year. Differences in these responses may in turn affect data on commuting, occupation, and industry. It is anticipated that the short form (age, gender, race) will continue to be distributed to all households every 10 years. A major advantage of the ACS is ensuring communities with residents in group housing get a fair share of federal funds. Group housing facilities (also called \"group quarters\") are randomly selected throughout the year depending on the size of your facility. It is the extra attention to detail that reduces some of the common and seemingly unavoidable errors generated by the previous long form.

{"key": "Data-Description_Long-Description", "value": "Methodology A resilience survey instrument was created by Energize Colorado that assessed the social and operational performance of small businesses, based on key measures of business health and success found in the scientific literature. The survey was sent electronically to approximately 14,000 small business owners from Energize Colorado\u2019s database. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and statistical tests measuring the correlation between the SBRI, demographics, and overall business performance, in order to understand predictors of small business resilience.  The Small Business Resilience Index seeks to quantifiably measure the small business ecosystem in order to improve the resilience of small businesses and provide future guidance to small business owners, associations, and governmental leaders in Colorado. Our index is composed of two, interrelated metrics of Resilience Capital: 1) Social Capital, and 2) Operational Capital. Together, these two data sets when combined are referred to as the Small Business Resilience Index (SBRI).  About Energize Colorado Small businesses and entrepreneurs are the backbone of Colorado\u2019s economy. If they thrive, the communities they operate in thrive. Founded in the wake of COVID-19, but with a long-term mission, Energize Colorado is a nonprofit organization that aims to advance resilience and inclusivity in Colorado\u2019s small business ecosystem. Led by innovative leaders and powered by seasoned volunteers from across Colorado, we leverage our networks and entrepreneurial know-how to advocate on behalf of our small business community. By providing access to capital, free resources, and creating new programs to meet the needs of small businesses, we\u2019re working to bridge the racial and economic divides in Colorado."}, {"key": "Data-Description_Field-Names,-comma-delimited", "value": "survey_date, company_zip, number_locations, full_time_employees, part_time_employees, contract_employees, 12_month_revenue, Q_My company receives good and timely information when regulations change., Q_My company can easily get information about business assistance programs., Q_My employees have access to essential on the job education and training., Q_My employees have the necessary skillsets and knowledge required to make my business successful., Q_My company communicates regularly with other businesses in the area similar to my own., Q_My company receives advice/mentorship from external advisors (formal or informal)., Q_My company is connected to organizations or associations designed to help businesses like mine (e.g. chamber of commerce, Colorado Bioscience Association)., Q_My company plans on hiring more people in the next 12 months., Q_My company has had higher voluntary employee turnover (quitting) than normal in the last 12 months., Q_My company has had higher involuntary employee turnover (termination due to economic hardship) than normal in the last 12 months., Q_My company\u2019s operations are efficient and can adjust rapidly (as needed)., Q_My company can currently meet the demands of my customers., Q_My company\u2019s current ability to meet customer needs is negatively impacted by external forces (e.g., suppliers, environmental)., Q_How have your sales increased or decreased over the last year?, Q_How has your profit increased or decreased over the last year?, Q_My company has enough cash on hand to meet my business needs for the next 12 months., Q_My company is currently seeking additional funding (outside of current sources) to run my business., Q_My customers have the resources and stability to continue buying my service / product., Q_How do you currently measure the performance of your business?, Q_My company often uses and seeks new technology to assist and complete our work., Q_My company often uses and seeks new technology to connect with customers., Q_My company often invests in online/digital security tools to protect company and customer data., Q_I am able to implement new technology solutions and programs successfully into my business operations (either myself or with assistance)., Q_I am able to use multiple methods of marketing (email, social media, phone service) to engage/support my customers., Q_What is your monthly spend for your website and digital solutions for Customer Growth?, Q_What is your monthly spend for your website and digital solutions for Operational Efficiency?, Q_What is your monthly spend for your website and digital solutions for Online/Digital Security?, Q_What is your monthly spend for your website and digital solutions for Point of Sale Solutions?, Q_What is your monthly spend for your website and digital solutions for Employee Recruitment?, Q_What is your monthly spend for your website and digital solutions for Website Design and Maintenance?, Q_What is your monthly spend for your website and digital solutions for Other?, Q_What is your monthly spend for your website and digital solutions for Other?.1, Q_If my primary method of serving my customers was disrupted, I could adapt and change my means of customer delivery., Q_I frequently seek new ways and avenues of growing my business (new delivery methods, new technology, etc.)., Q_My company would be able to continue to operate if there was another lockdown today., Q_To what degree was your business affected by the pandemic and related lockdowns?, Q_To what degree was your business affected by the pandemic and related lockdowns?

for Charities Operating in Colorado, Fundraising Revenue of Charities Operating in Colorado, Purpose and Operational Size of Charities Operating in Colorado, Total Revenue of Charities Operating in Colorado. Types, numbers, acreage, and expenses of conservation easements held by charitable organizations as reported to the IRS in annual filings using Form 990, and provided by the Colorado Department of State (CDOS). This information comes from Schedule D, Part II, lines 1-9 of IRS Form 990 (2016 version). Only organizations that answered \"Yes\" on Form 990, Part IV, line 7, \"Did the organization receive or hold a conservation easement, including easements to preserve open space, the environment, historic land areas, or historic structures?\" complete Part III of Schedule D. In addition to reporting on conservation easements, also report in Part II other interests in real property that under state law have attributes similar to a conservation easement and are established for the purpose of conservation and preservation (for example, certain restrictive covenants and equitable servitudes). Don\u2019t report utility easements. Line 1. Check the box for the purpose or purposes for which the organization held the easement(s) during the tax year. Check all that apply. Line 2. Provide an answer for each item. Line 2a. Enter the total number of conservation easements held by the organization at the end of the tax year. This shouldn\u2019t be an estimate or a rounded number. Line 2b. Enter the total acreage restricted by conservation easements held by the organization at the end of the tax year. Compute the total acreage by adding together all the acres of land subject to all the easements held as of the end of the tax year. Don\u2019t include conservation easements on certified historic structures. Acreage can be expressed in decimal points for properties subject to easements where the acreage consists of less than whole numbers. For example, two and one-half acres can be expressed as 2.5 acres. Line 2c. Enter the number of conservation easements on certified historic structures held by the organization at the end of the tax year. A certified historic structure is any building or structure listed in the National Register of Historic Places as well as any building certified as being of historic significance to a registered historic district. See section 170(h)(4)(B) for special rules that apply to contributions of conservation easements on certified historic structures in registered historic districts. Line 2d. Enter the number of conservation easements included in the answer to line 2c that the organization acquired after July 25, 2006, and not on a historic structure listed in the National Register. Line 3. To be eligible for a federal charitable income tax deduction for the donation of a conservation easement to a qualified organization, the easement must be granted in perpetuity. For purposes of maintaining its tax exemption, the recipient tax-exempt organization generally must protect the conservation easements it holds in perpetuity. Enter the total number of conservation easements held by the organization that were modified, transferred, released, extinguished, or terminated, in whole or in part, during the tax year. For example, if two easements were modified and one easement was terminated during the tax year, enter the number 3. For each easement modified, transferred, released, extinguished, or terminated, in whole or in part, explain the changes in Part XIII. Tax exemption may be undermined by the modification, transfer, release, extinguishment, or termination of an easement. For purposes of this Schedule D reporting requirement, an easement is modified when its terms are amended or altered in any manner. For example, if the deed of easement is amended to increase the amount of land subject to the easement or to add, alter, or remove restrictions regarding the use of the property subject to the easement, the easement is modified. An easement is transferred if, for example, the organization assigns, sells, releases, quitclaims, or otherwise disposes of the easement whether with or without consideration. An easement is released, extinguished, or terminated when it is condemned, extinguished by court order, transferred to the land owner, or in any way rendered void and unenforceable, in each case whether in whole or in part. An easement is also released, extinguished, or terminated when all or part of the property subject to the easement is removed from the protection of the easement in exchange for the protection of some other property or cash to be used to protect some other property. The categories described in the preceding paragraph are provided for convenience purposes only and aren\u2019t to be considered legally binding or mutually exclusive. For example, a modification may also involve a transfer and an extinguishment, depending on the circumstances. Use of a synonym for any of these terms doesn\u2019t avoid the application of the reporting requirement. For example, calling an action a \u201cswap\u201d or a \u201cboundary line adjustment\u201d doesn\u2019t mean the action isn\u2019t also a modification, transfer, or extinguishment. Line 4. Enter the total number of states where property is located and subject to a conservation easement held by the organization during the tax year. Line 5. A qualified organization must have a commitment to protect the conservation purposes of the easement, and have the resources to enforce the restrictions. Report whether the organization has a written policy or policies about how the organization will monitor, inspect, and handle violations, and how it will enforce conservation easements. If \u201cYes,\u201d briefly summarize such policy or policies in Part XIII. Also, indicate whether such policy or policies are reflected in the organization\u2019s easement documents. Monitoring means the organization investigates the use or condition of the real property restricted by the easement to determine if the property owner is adhering to the restrictions imposed by the terms of the easement to ensure the conservation purpose of the easement is being achieved. Inspection means an onsite visit to observe the property to carry out a monitoring purpose. Enforcement of an easement means action taken by the organization after it discovers a violation to compel a property owner to adhere to the terms of the conservation easement. Such activities can include communications with the property owner explaining his or her obligations with respect to the easement, arbitration, or litigation. Line 6. Enter the total number of hours devoted during the tax year to monitoring, inspecting, handling -2- 2017 Instructions for Schedule D (Form 990) Page 3 of 6 Fileid: \u2026 s/I990SCHD/2017/A/XML/Cycle03/source 16:31 - 16-Nov-2017 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. violations, and enforcing conservation easements, as those terms are defined in the instructions for line 5 above. Include the hours devoted to this purpose by any of the organization\u2019s paid or unpaid staff and by any of the organization\u2019s agents or independent contractors. Line 7. Enter the total amount of expenses incurred by the organization during the tax year to monitor, inspect, handle violations, and enforce the conservation easements it held during the year as those terms are defined in the instructions for line 5. Line 8. Answer \u201cYes\u201d if each of the organization\u2019s fa\u00e7ade easements acquired after July 25, 2006, satisfies the requirements of sections 170(h)(4)(B)(i) and 170(h)(4)(B)(ii). Section 170(h)(4)(B)(i) requires each fa\u00e7ade easement donated after August 17, 2006, to include a restriction that preserves the entire exterior of the building, including the front, sides, rear, and height of the building, and to prohibit any change in the exterior of the building that is inconsistent with the historical character of such exterior. Section 170(h)(4)(B)(ii) requires the donor and donee to enter into a written agreement certifying, among other things, that the donee organization has the resources to manage and enforce the restriction and a commitment to do so. Line 9. Enter in Part XIII a description of how the organization reports conservation easements in its revenue and expense statement and on its balance sheet. Include in Part XIII, if applicable, the text of the footnote to the organization\u2019s financial statements that describes the organization\u2019s accounting for conservation easements and the basis for its reporting position (for example, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 02-7, Example 1 (now codified in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350-30-55-29 to 55-32)). The organization must report any qualified conservation contributions and contributions of conservation easements in Form 990, Part VIII, Statement of Revenue; Schedule A (Form 990 or 990-EZ), Public Charity Status and Public Support; Schedule B (Form 990, 990-EZ, or 990-PF), Schedule of Contributors; and Schedule M (Form 990), Noncash Contributions, consistently with how it CAUTION ! reports revenue from such contributions in its books, records, and financial statements."}, {"key": "Data-Description_Single-Row", "value": "Charitable organization name and address, EIN, type, number, acreage, and expense of conservation easements"}, {"key": "Data-Description_Oldest-Record-in-Dataset", "value": 2011}, {"key": "Data-Description_Data-Collection-Instrument", "value": "e-Filing"}, {"key": "Data-Description_Collection-Method", "value": "Data is updated from the IRS monthly, extracted, transformed, and loaded to the Colorado Department of State."}, {"key": "Additional-Dataset-Documentation_Data-Dictionary", "value": ""}, {"key": "Additional-Dataset-Documentation_Additional-Metadata", "value": ""}, {"key": "Additional-Dataset-Documentation_Technical-Documentation", "value": ""}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Expected-Update-Frequency", "value": "Static"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.colorado.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.colorado.gov/d/u4xw-xiec", "link": "https://data.colorado.gov/Business/Conservation-Easements-for-Charities-Operating-in-/u4xw-xiec", "owner": {"id": "8cet-tw9x", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Colorado Information Marketplace"}, "creator": {"id": "8cet-tw9x", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Colorado Information Marketplace"}}

With support from the State, 11 master plans were developed with the understanding that watershed recovery and resilience requires a holistic approach from the top of the watershed to the bottom, and also requires the engagement and participation of a broad range of watershed stakeholders, including local and state government, non-profits, businesses and landowners. The master planning process provided a collaborative approach to identify and prioritize needs, to develop projects and to guide the implementation. The master planning process also catalyzed the formation of watershed coalitions which are now actively guiding restoration and resiliency efforts within the flood impacted watersheds.", "attribution": "Muller Engineering", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-04-10T19:07:39.000Z", "createdAt": "2016-11-22T15:37:17.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-04-10T19:07:39.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2016-11-22T15:37:48.000Z", "columns_name": ["SourceFeat", "AreaAcres", "TNMID", "HUC8", "LoadDate", "GNIS_ID", "Shape_Area", "OBJECTID", "SourceOrig", "AreaSqKm", "MetaSource", "Name", "the_geom", "Shape_Leng", "SourceData", "States"], "columns_field_name": ["source_feat", "area_acres", "tnmid", "huc_8", "load_date", "gnis_id", "shape_area", "objectid", "source_orig", "area_sq_km", "meta_source", "name", "the_geom", "shape_leng", "source_data", "states"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "MultiPolygon", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "locked": false, "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2016-11-22T15:37:54.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Water", "domain_tags": ["boundaries", "coalition", "colorado", "flood", "resiliency", "resilient", "watershed"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Contributing-Agency-Information_Technical-Contact-and-Phone", "value": ""}, {"key": "Contributing-Agency-Information_Agency-Data-Series-Page", "value": ""}, {"key": "Contributing-Agency-Information_Agency-Program-Page", "value": ""}, {"key": "Contributing-Agency-Information_Data-Source", "value": ""}, {"key": "Contributing-Agency-Information_Citation", "value": ""}, {"key": "Contributing-Agency-Information_Business-Contact-and-Phone", "value": ""}, {"key": "Dataset-Coverage_Granularity", "value": ""}, {"key": "Dataset-Coverage_Unit-of-Analysis", "value": ""}, {"key": "Dataset-Coverage_Geographic-Coverage", "value": ""}, {"key": "Geospatial_Collection-Method", "value": ""}, {"key": "Geospatial_Horizontal-Accuracy", "value": ""}, {"key": "Geospatial_Horizontal-Coordinate-System", "value": ""}, {"key": "Data-Updates_Update-Method", "value": ""}, {"key": "Data-Updates_Update-Schedule", "value": ""}, {"key": "Data-Updates_Total-Records-at-Initial-Publish", "value": ""}, {"key": "Flood-2013_Content-type", "value": ""}, {"key": "Data-Description_Field-Names,-comma-delimited", "value": ""}, {"key": "Data-Description_Date-of-Initial-Dataset-Creation", "value": ""}, {"key": "Data-Description_Collection-Mode", "value": ""}, {"key": "Data-Description_Newest-Record-in-Dataset", "value": ""}, {"key": "Data-Description_Long-Description", "value": ""}, {"key": "Data-Description_Oldest-Record-in-Dataset", "value": ""}, {"key": "Data-Description_Data-Collection-Instrument", "value": ""}, {"key": "Data-Description_Collection-Method", "value": ""}, {"key": "Additional-Dataset-Documentation_Data-Dictionary", "value": ""}, {"key": "Additional-Dataset-Documentation_Additional-Metadata", "value": ""}, {"key": "Additional-Dataset-Documentation_Technical-Documentation", "value": ""}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Stewardship-Plan", "value": ""}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Expected-Update-Frequency", "value": ""}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Data-Quality-Certification", "value": ""}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Applicable-Information-Quality-Guideline-Designation", "value": ""}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.colorado.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.colorado.gov/d/uc6k-43ed", "link": "https://data.colorado.gov/Water/Big_Thompson/uc6k-43ed", "owner": {"id": "xxxj-hmi8", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "OIT - GIS"}, "creator": {"id": "xxxj-hmi8", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "OIT - GIS"}}

Sampling errors are misrepresentations of a larger population based on the selection of the representative sample. Accuracy of the estimates depend in part on how typical the people within the sampled housing units are to others within their area. The Census estimates sampling error based on the population and its extent of variability.

Sampling errors are misrepresentations of a larger population based on the selection of the representative sample.

The Census estimates sampling error based on the population and its extent of variability.

Unlike the every-10-year census, the ACS survey continues all year, every year by randomly sampling addresses in every state, thus creating a \u201crolling average\u201d of data about designated geographic regions to generate up-to-date statistics used by many federal, state, tribal, and local leaders. The U.S. decennial census is to provides counts of people for the purpose of Congressional apportionment, the ACS measures the changing social and economic characteristics of the U.S. population. The ACS does not provide official counts of the population in between censuses. Some American Community Survey questions have been asked by the census since it first began in 1790. Because ACS data are collected continuously, they are not always comparable to data collected from the decennial census. For example, in the case of employment statistics, both surveys ask about employment status during the week prior to the survey. However, data from the decennial census are typically collected between March and August, whereas data from the ACS are collected each month and reflect employment throughout the year. Differences in these responses may in turn affect data on commuting, occupation, and industry. It is anticipated that the short form (age, gender, race) will continue to be distributed to all households every 10 years. A major advantage of the ACS is ensuring communities with residents in group housing get a fair share of federal funds. Group housing facilities (also called \"group quarters\") are randomly selected throughout the year depending on the size of your facility. It is the extra attention to detail that reduces some of the common and seemingly unavoidable errors generated by the previous long form.

Sampling errors are misrepresentations of a larger population based on the selection of the representative sample. Accuracy of the estimates depend in part on how typical the people within the sampled housing units are to others within their area. The Census estimates sampling error based on the population and its extent of variability.
