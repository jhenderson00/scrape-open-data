Overcounts are known to exist in student and dual-residence populations, while undercounts are a given for homeless and illegal immigrants. Errors arise from both sampling and non-sampling methods. Sampling errors are misrepresentations of a larger population based on the selection of the representative sample. Accuracy of the estimates depend in part on how typical the people within the sampled housing units are to others within their area. The Census estimates sampling error based on the population and its extent of variability. The long-form of the Census is distributed to a subset of households, and includes additional data related to households, economy, employment, occupation, as well as occupancy and building structure data. Household fields include: Total Households, Total Families, Households by Household Type by Household Size, Persons in Group Quarters by Detailed Group Quarters Type, Persons 25 Years and Over by Educational Attainment, Persons 16 Years and Over by Labor Force and Employment Status, Median Household Income, Median Family Income, Per Capita Income, Persons by Poverty Status in Previous Year.

By purchasing a CORSAR card you are contributing to the Search and Rescue Fund, which will reimburse these teams for costs incurred in your search and rescue. Funds remaining at the end of the year are used to help pay for training and equipment for these teams. Anyone with a current hunting/fishing license, or boat, snowmobile, ATV registration is already covered by the fund.\r\n\r\nThe card is not insurance and does not reimburse individuals nor does it pay for medical transport. Medical transport includes helicopter flights or ground ambulance. If aircraft are used as a search vehicle, those costs are reimbursed by the fund. If the aircraft becomes a medical transport due to a medical emergency, the medical portion of the transport is not covered.\r\n\r\nThe CORSAR cards are available for $3 for one year and $12 for five years, and can be purchased at over 300 retailers in the state.", "attribution": "Department of Local Affairs", "attribution_link": "http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite/DOLA-Main/CBON/1251592090523", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-04-19T21:01:13.000Z", "createdAt": "2013-11-13T16:30:55.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-04-19T21:01:13.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2014-04-24T17:24:30.000Z", "columns_name": ["Address", "Phone #", "Address (state)", "Address (zip)", "Address (city)", "Address (address)", "Counties", "Region", "Vendor"], "columns_field_name": ["location", "phone", "location_state", "location_zip", "location_city", "location_address", ":@computed_region_nku6_53ud", "region", "vendor"], "columns_datatype": ["Point", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{"view": "address_coords", "align": "left"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "locked": false, "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2014-04-24T17:25:42.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["finance", "infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Recreation", "domain_tags": ["card", "corsar", "department", "dola", "local affairs", "rescue", "search", "search and rescue", "vendor"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.colorado.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.colorado.gov/d/vhyu-69jb", "link": "https://data.colorado.gov/Recreation/Colorado-Search-Rescue-Card-Vendors/vhyu-69jb", "owner": {"id": "fjxp-pzgm", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "camillid"}, "creator": {"id": "fjxp-pzgm", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "camillid"}}

Unlike the every-10-year census, the ACS survey continues all year, every year by randomly sampling addresses in every state, thus creating a \u201crolling average\u201d of data about designated geographic regions to generate up-to-date statistics used by many federal, state, tribal, and local leaders. The U.S. decennial census is to provides counts of people for the purpose of Congressional apportionment, the ACS measures the changing social and economic characteristics of the U.S. population. The ACS does not provide official counts of the population in between censuses. Some American Community Survey questions have been asked by the census since it first began in 1790. Because ACS data are collected continuously, they are not always comparable to data collected from the decennial census. For example, in the case of employment statistics, both surveys ask about employment status during the week prior to the survey. However, data from the decennial census are typically collected between March and August, whereas data from the ACS are collected each month and reflect employment throughout the year. Differences in these responses may in turn affect data on commuting, occupation, and industry. It is anticipated that the short form (age, gender, race) will continue to be distributed to all households every 10 years. A major advantage of the ACS is ensuring communities with residents in group housing get a fair share of federal funds. Group housing facilities (also called \"group quarters\") are randomly selected throughout the year depending on the size of your facility. It is the extra attention to detail that reduces some of the common and seemingly unavoidable errors generated by the previous long form.
