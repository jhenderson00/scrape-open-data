Sampling errors are misrepresentations of a larger population based on the selection of the representative sample. Accuracy of the estimates depend in part on how typical the people within the sampled housing units are to others within their area. The Census estimates sampling error based on the population and its extent of variability.

Household fields include: Total Households, Total Families, Households by Household Type by Household Size, Persons in Group Quarters by Detailed Group Quarters Type, Persons 25 Years and Over by Educational Attainment, Persons 16 Years and Over by Labor Force and Employment Status, Median Household Income, Median Family Income, Per Capita Income, Persons by Poverty Status in Previous Year.

Unlike the every-10-year census, the ACS survey continues all year, every year by randomly sampling addresses in every state, thus creating a \u201crolling average\u201d of data about designated geographic regions to generate up-to-date statistics used by many federal, state, tribal, and local leaders. The U.S. decennial census is to provides counts of people for the purpose of Congressional apportionment, the ACS measures the changing social and economic characteristics of the U.S. population. The ACS does not provide official counts of the population in between censuses. Some American Community Survey questions have been asked by the census since it first began in 1790. Because ACS data are collected continuously, they are not always comparable to data collected from the decennial census. For example, in the case of employment statistics, both surveys ask about employment status during the week prior to the survey. However, data from the decennial census are typically collected between March and August, whereas data from the ACS are collected each month and reflect employment throughout the year. Differences in these responses may in turn affect data on commuting, occupation, and industry. It is anticipated that the short form (age, gender, race) will continue to be distributed to all households every 10 years. A major advantage of the ACS is ensuring communities with residents in group housing get a fair share of federal funds. Group housing facilities (also called \"group quarters\") are randomly selected throughout the year depending on the size of your facility. It is the extra attention to detail that reduces some of the common and seemingly unavoidable errors generated by the previous long form.

The Census estimates sampling error based on the population and its extent of variability.
