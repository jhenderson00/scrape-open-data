Overcounts are known to exist in student and dual-residence populations, while undercounts are a given for homeless and illegal immigrants. Errors arise from both sampling and non-sampling methods. Sampling errors are misrepresentations of a larger population based on the selection of the representative sample. Accuracy of the estimates depend in part on how typical the people within the sampled housing units are to others within their area. The Census estimates sampling error based on the population and its extent of variability. The long-form of the Census is distributed to a subset of households, and includes additional data related to households, economy, employment, occupation, as well as occupancy and building structure data. Household fields include: Total Households, Total Families, Households by Household Type by Household Size, Persons in Group Quarters by Detailed Group Quarters Type, Persons 25 Years and Over by Educational Attainment, Persons 16 Years and Over by Labor Force and Employment Status, Median Household Income, Median Family Income, Per Capita Income, Persons by Poverty Status in Previous Year.

Excluded are members of the armed forces, the self-employed, proprietors, domestic workers, unpaid family workers, and railroad workers covered by the railroad unemployment insurance system.

Not surprisingly, data become more accurate over time, as new incidents are reported and more information comes to light during investigations. Incidents that occurred at least 30 days ago tend to be the most accurate, although records are returned for incidents that happened yesterday. For motor vehicle crashes that are still under investigation and involve a serious bodily or fatal injury, some attributes will appear as, \"UNDER INVESTIGATION.\" This is to help ensure that any court proceedings related to these incidents are not inadvertently hindered. Once the investigation is closed, all of the incident's attributes will be visible.

Likewise, content provided on this site will probably differ somewhat from crime statistics published elsewhere by the City and County of Denver, even though they draw from the same database.

Some of the first fish production facilities in the country were established in this state. Unlike other states located in the southern tier and coastal areas of the U.S., Colorado does not have a reputation as a major producer of aquacultured products. A semi-arid, continental-temperate climate, resulting in a relative scarcity of water, and a land-locked border discourage widespread use of \"traditional\" forms of aquaculture that require large amounts of flowing or standing water and year-round, sub-tropical temperatures. As a result of the relative limitations imposed on traditional aquaculture by the state\u2019s natural resources and climate, some individuals and companies have resorted to more innovative approaches and technologies for producing warmwater aquatic organisms. Additionally, they have begun to take advantage of man-made resources and some natural resources that are unique to Colorado (abundant sunshine and significant geothermal resources) by turning to indoor, high-density production in water recirculation tank systems as a means to conserve water, to economically heat water for the production of warmwater fishes, and to retain these valuable resources within the production system.  When these indoor fish production techniques are coupled with the production of plants (an integrated approach called aquaponics), production and conservation of resources are enhanced even more.

Unlike the every-10-year census, the ACS survey continues all year, every year by randomly sampling addresses in every state, thus creating a \u201crolling average\u201d of data about designated geographic regions to generate up-to-date statistics used by many federal, state, tribal, and local leaders. The U.S. decennial census is to provides counts of people for the purpose of Congressional apportionment, the ACS measures the changing social and economic characteristics of the U.S. population. The ACS does not provide official counts of the population in between censuses. Some American Community Survey questions have been asked by the census since it first began in 1790. Because ACS data are collected continuously, they are not always comparable to data collected from the decennial census. For example, in the case of employment statistics, both surveys ask about employment status during the week prior to the survey. However, data from the decennial census are typically collected between March and August, whereas data from the ACS are collected each month and reflect employment throughout the year. Differences in these responses may in turn affect data on commuting, occupation, and industry. It is anticipated that the short form (age, gender, race) will continue to be distributed to all households every 10 years. A major advantage of the ACS is ensuring communities with residents in group housing get a fair share of federal funds. Group housing facilities (also called \"group quarters\") are randomly selected throughout the year depending on the size of your facility. It is the extra attention to detail that reduces some of the common and seemingly unavoidable errors generated by the previous long form.

Includes company name, county, working capacity, max capacity, and maximum daily delivery. The Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for collecting and reporting energy data. Therefore, it is mandatory for Respondents to furnish requested energy information on all EIA survey forms that are applicable to them for each reporting period. Each year, the EIA sends a copy of their Forms (including form completion instructions) to all Respondents. The instructions fully explain who is required to file the given form, and definitions are provided to clarify the types of data being requested. The Natural Gas Information Annual Respondent Query System (henceforth referred to as the Query System) shows Annual Natural Gas Supply and Disposition and Underground Gas Storage data collected from several of these forms, down to the company level. Data are displayed in various formats from three different surveys. The EIA-176 form contains responses submitted from an identified universe of pipelines, local distribution companies, and operators of fields, wells or gas processing plants, who distribute gas to end users or transport gas across State borders; or underground natural gas storage operators. The EIA 191 collects information on working and base gas in reservoirs, injections, withdrawals, and location of reservoirs from operators of all underground natural gas storage fields on a monthly basis. Field-level data in the \"Natural Gas Annual Respondent Query System\" (NGARQS) may reflect minor data updates that were not included in the published aggregates in the Natural Gas Monthly and Natural Gas Annual. The Energy Information Administration\u2019s (EIA) Form EIA-757, \u201cSurvey of Natural Gas Processing Plants,\u201d is used to collect information on the capacity, status, and operations of natural gas processing plants and to monitor constraints of natural gas processing plants during periods of supply disruption in areas affected by emergency situations, such as a hurricane. EIA is responsible for collecting and reporting on this energy data. Therefore, it is mandatory for Plant Respondents to furnish the processing capacity information applicable to them on the survey for each reporting period (occurring approximately once every three years).

Unlike the every-10-year census, the ACS survey continues all year, every year by randomly sampling addresses in every state, thus creating a \u201crolling average\u201d of data about designated geographic regions to generate up-to-date statistics used by many federal, state, tribal, and local leaders. The U.S. decennial census is to provides counts of people for the purpose of Congressional apportionment, the ACS measures the changing social and economic characteristics of the U.S. population. The ACS does not provide official counts of the population in between censuses. Some American Community Survey questions have been asked by the census since it first began in 1790. Because ACS data are collected continuously, they are not always comparable to data collected from the decennial census. For example, in the case of employment statistics, both surveys ask about employment status during the week prior to the survey. However, data from the decennial census are typically collected between March and August, whereas data from the ACS are collected each month and reflect employment throughout the year. Differences in these responses may in turn affect data on commuting, occupation, and industry. It is anticipated that the short form (age, gender, race) will continue to be distributed to all households every 10 years. A major advantage of the ACS is ensuring communities with residents in group housing get a fair share of federal funds. Group housing facilities (also called \"group quarters\") are randomly selected throughout the year depending on the size of your facility. It is the extra attention to detail that reduces some of the common and seemingly unavoidable errors generated by the previous long form.

The State of Colorado created a first-of-its-kind watershed restoration program utilizing funding from U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Through Community Development Block Grant \u2013 Disaster Recovery funds, the Watershed Resilience Pilot Program provides grants to watershed coalitions for staff support and resilient river restoration projects. These grant funds build coalition capacity, bringing together the diverse range of stakeholders required to restore disaster-impacted watersheds. River restoration projects in this program not only restore natural systems, but achieve multiple benefits, such as increasing community connectivity by tying into trail systems, promoting safety by protecting infrastructure, enhancing local economy by incorporating recreational opportunities and building resiliency for communities and ecosystems.

The solar radiation values represent the resource available to solar energy systems. The data was created using cloud properties which are generated using the AVHRR Pathfinder Atmospheres-Extended (PATMOS-x) algorithms. Fast all-sky radiation model for solar applications (FARMS) in conjunction with the cloud properties, and aerosol optical depth (AOD) and precipitable water vapor (PWV) from ancillary source are used to estimate DNI and GHI. The direct normal irradiance (DNI) and GHI are computed for clear skies using the REST2 model. For cloud scenes identified by the cloud mask, the FARMS is used to compute the GHI. The DNI for cloud scenes is then computed using the DISC model. The data are averaged from hourly model output over 17 years (1998-2014).

Sampling errors are misrepresentations of a larger population based on the selection of the representative sample. Accuracy of the estimates depend in part on how typical the people within the sampled housing units are to others within their area. The Census estimates sampling error based on the population and its extent of variability.

Household fields include: Total Households, Total Families, Households by Household Type by Household Size, Persons in Group Quarters by Detailed Group Quarters Type, Persons 25 Years and Over by Educational Attainment, Persons 16 Years and Over by Labor Force and Employment Status, Median Household Income, Median Family Income, Per Capita Income, Persons by Poverty Status in Previous Year.

Unlike the every-10-year census, the ACS survey continues all year, every year by randomly sampling addresses in every state, thus creating a \u201crolling average\u201d of data about designated geographic regions to generate up-to-date statistics used by many federal, state, tribal, and local leaders. The U.S. decennial census is to provides counts of people for the purpose of Congressional apportionment, the ACS measures the changing social and economic characteristics of the U.S. population. The ACS does not provide official counts of the population in between censuses. Some American Community Survey questions have been asked by the census since it first began in 1790. Because ACS data are collected continuously, they are not always comparable to data collected from the decennial census. For example, in the case of employment statistics, both surveys ask about employment status during the week prior to the survey. However, data from the decennial census are typically collected between March and August, whereas data from the ACS are collected each month and reflect employment throughout the year. Differences in these responses may in turn affect data on commuting, occupation, and industry. It is anticipated that the short form (age, gender, race) will continue to be distributed to all households every 10 years. A major advantage of the ACS is ensuring communities with residents in group housing get a fair share of federal funds. Group housing facilities (also called \"group quarters\") are randomly selected throughout the year depending on the size of your facility. It is the extra attention to detail that reduces some of the common and seemingly unavoidable errors generated by the previous long form.

The Census estimates sampling error based on the population and its extent of variability.

The U.S. decennial census is to provides counts of people for the purpose of Congressional apportionment, the ACS measures the changing social and economic characteristics of the U.S. population. The ACS does not provide official counts of the population in between censuses. Some American Community Survey questions have been asked by the census since it first began in 1790. Because ACS data are collected continuously, they are not always comparable to data collected from the decennial census. For example, in the case of employment statistics, both surveys ask about employment status during the week prior to the survey. However, data from the decennial census are typically collected between March and August, whereas data from the ACS are collected each month and reflect employment throughout the year. Differences in these responses may in turn affect data on commuting, occupation, and industry. It is anticipated that the short form (age, gender, race) will continue to be distributed to all households every 10 years. A major advantage of the ACS is ensuring communities with residents in group housing get a fair share of federal funds. Group housing facilities (also called \"group quarters\") are randomly selected throughout the year depending on the size of your facility. It is the extra attention to detail that reduces some of the common and seemingly unavoidable errors generated by the previous long form.

Unlike the every-10-year census, the ACS survey continues all year, every year by randomly sampling addresses in every state, thus creating a \u201crolling average\u201d of data about designated geographic regions to generate up-to-date statistics used by many federal, state, tribal, and local leaders. The U.S. decennial census is to provides counts of people for the purpose of Congressional apportionment, the ACS measures the changing social and economic characteristics of the U.S. population. The ACS does not provide official counts of the population in between censuses. Some American Community Survey questions have been asked by the census since it first began in 1790. Because ACS data are collected continuously, they are not always comparable to data collected from the decennial census. For example, in the case of employment statistics, both surveys ask about employment status during the week prior to the survey. However, data from the decennial census are typically collected between March and August, whereas data from the ACS are collected each month and reflect employment throughout the year. Differences in these responses may in turn affect data on commuting, occupation, and industry. It is anticipated that the short form (age, gender, race) will continue to be distributed to all households every 10 years. A major advantage of the ACS is ensuring communities with residents in group housing get a fair share of federal funds. Group housing facilities (also called \"group quarters\") are randomly selected throughout the year depending on the size of your facility. It is the extra attention to detail that reduces some of the common and seemingly unavoidable errors generated by the previous long form.

Overcounts are known to exist in student and dual-residence populations, while undercounts are a given for homeless and illegal immigrants. Errors arise from both sampling and non-sampling methods. Sampling errors are misrepresentations of a larger population based on the selection of the representative sample. Accuracy of the estimates depend in part on how typical the people within the sampled housing units are to others within their area. The Census estimates sampling error based on the population and its extent of variability.

Unlike the every-10-year census, the ACS survey continues all year, every year by randomly sampling addresses in every state, thus creating a \u201crolling average\u201d of data about designated geographic regions to generate up-to-date statistics used by many federal, state, tribal, and local leaders. The U.S. decennial census is to provides counts of people for the purpose of Congressional apportionment, the ACS measures the changing social and economic characteristics of the U.S. population. The ACS does not provide official counts of the population in between censuses. Some American Community Survey questions have been asked by the census since it first began in 1790. Because ACS data are collected continuously, they are not always comparable to data collected from the decennial census. For example, in the case of employment statistics, both surveys ask about employment status during the week prior to the survey. However, data from the decennial census are typically collected between March and August, whereas data from the ACS are collected each month and reflect employment throughout the year. Differences in these responses may in turn affect data on commuting, occupation, and industry. It is anticipated that the short form (age, gender, race) will continue to be distributed to all households every 10 years. A major advantage of the ACS is ensuring communities with residents in group housing get a fair share of federal funds. Group housing facilities (also called \"group quarters\") are randomly selected throughout the year depending on the size of your facility. It is the extra attention to detail that reduces some of the common and seemingly unavoidable errors generated by the previous long form.

File the 2016 return for calendar year 2016 and fiscal years that began in 2016 and ended in 2017. For a fiscal year return, fill in the tax year space at the top of page 1. See General Instructions, Section D. Accounting Periods and Methods, earlier, for additional information about accounting periods. Item C. Name and address. Enter the organization\u2019s legal name on the \u201cName of organization\u201d line. If the organization operates under a name different from its legal name, enter the alternate name on the \u201cDoing Business As\u201d (DBA) line. If multiple DBA names won\u2019t fit on the line, enter one on the line and enter the others on Schedule O (Form 990 or 990-EZ).

Include the suite, room, or other unit number after the street address. If the Post Office does not deliver mail to the street address and the organization has a P.O. box, enter the box number instead of the street address. For foreign addresses, enter the information in the following order: city or town, state or province, the name of the country, and the postal code. Don\u2019t abbreviate the country name. If a change in address occurs after the return is filed, use Form 8822-B, Change of Address or Responsible Party\u2014Business, to notify the IRS of the new address. Item D. Employer identification number (EIN). Use the EIN provided to the organization for filing its Form 990 and federal tax returns. The organization must have only one EIN. If it has more than one and has not been advised which to use, notify the: Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service Center Ogden, UT 84201-0027 State the numbers the organization has, the name and address to which each EIN was assigned, and the address of the organization\u2019s principal office. The IRS will advise the organization which number to use. A subordinate organization that files a separate Form 990 instead of being included in a group return must use its own EIN, and not that of the central organization.

Unlike the every-10-year census, the ACS survey continues all year, every year by randomly sampling addresses in every state, thus creating a \u201crolling average\u201d of data about designated geographic regions to generate up-to-date statistics used by many federal, state, tribal, and local leaders. The U.S. decennial census is to provides counts of people for the purpose of Congressional apportionment, the ACS measures the changing social and economic characteristics of the U.S. population. The ACS does not provide official counts of the population in between censuses. Some American Community Survey questions have been asked by the census since it first began in 1790. Because ACS data are collected continuously, they are not always comparable to data collected from the decennial census. For example, in the case of employment statistics, both surveys ask about employment status during the week prior to the survey. However, data from the decennial census are typically collected between March and August, whereas data from the ACS are collected each month and reflect employment throughout the year. Differences in these responses may in turn affect data on commuting, occupation, and industry. It is anticipated that the short form (age, gender, race) will continue to be distributed to all households every 10 years. A major advantage of the ACS is ensuring communities with residents in group housing get a fair share of federal funds. Group housing facilities (also called \"group quarters\") are randomly selected throughout the year depending on the size of your facility.

Fast all-sky radiation model for solar applications (FARMS) in conjunction with the cloud properties, and aerosol optical depth (AOD) and precipitable water vapor (PWV) from ancillary source are used to estimate DNI and GHI. The direct normal irradiance (DNI) and GHI are computed for clear skies using the REST2 model. For cloud scenes identified by the cloud mask, the FARMS is used to compute the GHI. The DNI for cloud scenes is then computed using the DISC model. The data are averaged from hourly model output over 17 years (1998-2014). The PATMOS-X model uses half-hourly radiance images in visible and infrared channels from the GOES series of geostationary weather satellites, daily snow cover data from the NSIDC and mixing ratio, temperature and pressure profiles from the Modern Era-Retrospective Analysis (MERRA) dataset.

In 2012 Colorado implemented the Transitional Colorado Assessment Program (TCAP) to reflect changes in the state adopted academic content standards and to provide information to teachers as they began incorporating the revised content standards in their daily instruction. The Transitional Colorado Assessment Program (TCAP) is Colorado\u2019s standards-based assessment designed to provide a picture of student performance to schools, districts, educators, parents and the community. The primary purpose of the assessment program is to determine the level at which Colorado students meet the Colorado Model Content Standards in the content areas assessed.

Sampling errors are misrepresentations of a larger population based on the selection of the representative sample. Accuracy of the estimates depend in part on how typical the people within the sampled housing units are to others within their area. The Census estimates sampling error based on the population and its extent of variability.

Household fields include: Total Households, Total Families, Households by Household Type by Household Size, Persons in Group Quarters by Detailed Group Quarters Type, Persons 25 Years and Over by Educational Attainment, Persons 16 Years and Over by Labor Force and Employment Status, Median Household Income, Median Family Income, Per Capita Income, Persons by Poverty Status in Previous Year.

This information comes from Schedule D, Part III, lines 1-5 of IRS Form 990 (2016 version). Only organizations that answered \"\"Yes\"\" on Form 990, Part IV, line 8, \"\"Did the organization maintain collections of works of art, historical treasures, or other similar assets?\"\" complete Part III of Schedule D.

For lines 1 and 2, refer to SFAS 116 (ASC 958) for meanings of the various terms. Lines 1 and 2. Pursuant to SFAS 116 (ASC 958), certain organizations can choose one of two methods to report collections of works of art, historical treasures, or other similar assets held for public exhibition, education, or research in furtherance of public service. An organization that doesn\u2019t recognize and capitalize its collections for financial statement purposes will report its collections on the face of its statement of activities, separately from revenues, expenses, gains, losses, and assets. An organization that recognizes and capitalizes its collections for financial statement purposes will report its collections as assets and revenues based upon its fair value measurement. Line 1 pertains to collection items held by the organization in furtherance of public service, and line 2 pertains to collection items held by the organization for financial gain, as those terms are described in SFAS 116 (ASC 958). Line 1a. If an organization has elected not to capitalize its collections, then provide in Part XIII the footnote(s) to the organization\u2019s financial statements that describe these collection items. Line 1b. If an organization has elected to capitalize its collections, provide on line 1b(i) the revenue relating to its collection items that is reported on Form 990, Part VIII, line 1. Also, provide on line 1b(ii) the value of the organization\u2019s collection items reported as total assets on Form 990, Part X, line 16, column (B). Line 2. If an organization has received or held collections for financial gain, provide on line 2a the revenue reported as to these collection items from the total revenue included on Form 990, Part VIII, line 1. Also, provide on line 2b the asset value assigned to these collection items, which value should also be reported as part of the organization\u2019s total assets reported on Form 990, Part X, line 16, column (B). Line 3. Based upon the organization\u2019s acquisition, accession, and other records, check all boxes that best describe how the organization utilizes its collections, including the collection\u2019s most significant use. Line 4. In Part XIII, provide a description of the organization\u2019s collections and explain how these collections further the organization\u2019s exempt purposes. Line 5. Answer \u201cYes\u201d to line 5 if during the year the organization solicited or received donations of art, historical treasures, or other similar assets to be sold in order to raise funds rather than to be maintained as part of the organization\u2019s collection."}, {"key": "Data-Description_Single-Row", "value": "Charitable organization name and address, EIN, uses and revenue for works of art"}, {"key": "Data-Description_Oldest-Record-in-Dataset", "value": 2011}, {"key": "Data-Description_Data-Collection-Instrument", "value": "e-Filing"}, {"key": "Data-Description_Collection-Method", "value": "Data is updated from the IRS monthly, extracted, transformed, and loaded to the Colorado Department of State."}, {"key": "Additional-Dataset-Documentation_Data-Dictionary", "value": ""}, {"key": "Additional-Dataset-Documentation_Additional-Metadata", "value": ""}, {"key": "Additional-Dataset-Documentation_Technical-Documentation", "value": ""}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Expected-Update-Frequency", "value": "Static"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.colorado.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.colorado.gov/d/n5sw-qzbs", "link": "https://data.colorado.gov/Business/Total-Revenue-and-Types-of-Art-for-Charities-Opera/n5sw-qzbs", "owner": {"id": "8cet-tw9x", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Colorado Information Marketplace"}, "creator": {"id": "8cet-tw9x", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Colorado Information Marketplace"}}

Unlike the every-10-year census, the ACS survey continues all year, every year by randomly sampling addresses in every state, thus creating a \u201crolling average\u201d of data about designated geographic regions to generate up-to-date statistics used by many federal, state, tribal, and local leaders. The U.S. decennial census is to provides counts of people for the purpose of Congressional apportionment, the ACS measures the changing social and economic characteristics of the U.S. population. The ACS does not provide official counts of the population in between censuses. Some American Community Survey questions have been asked by the census since it first began in 1790. Because ACS data are collected continuously, they are not always comparable to data collected from the decennial census. For example, in the case of employment statistics, both surveys ask about employment status during the week prior to the survey. However, data from the decennial census are typically collected between March and August, whereas data from the ACS are collected each month and reflect employment throughout the year. Differences in these responses may in turn affect data on commuting, occupation, and industry. It is anticipated that the short form (age, gender, race) will continue to be distributed to all households every 10 years. A major advantage of the ACS is ensuring communities with residents in group housing get a fair share of federal funds. Group housing facilities (also called \"group quarters\") are randomly selected throughout the year depending on the size of your facility. It is the extra attention to detail that reduces some of the common and seemingly unavoidable errors generated by the previous long form.

These structures include all reservoirs built after April 17, 1941, on watercourses which the state engineer has determined to be \"normally dry\" and having a capacity of not more than ten acre-feet and a vertical height not exceeding fifteen feet from the bottom of the channel to the bottom of the spillway. Again, as with erosion control dams, the height is measured from the lowest point of the upstream toe to the crest of the spillway. No livestock water tanks can be used for irrigation purposes.\r\nErosion control dams are governed under Colorado statute (see section 37-87-122, C.R.S. (1990). These types of structures may be constructed on water courses which have been determined by the state engineer to be normally dry (which for our purposes is dry more than 80% of the time). Structures of this type cannot exceed fifteen feet from the bottom of the channel to the bottom of the spillway and cannot exceed ten acre-feet at the emergency spillway level.

Overcounts are known to exist in student and dual-residence populations, while undercounts are a given for homeless and illegal immigrants. Errors arise from both sampling and non-sampling methods. Sampling errors are misrepresentations of a larger population based on the selection of the representative sample. Accuracy of the estimates depend in part on how typical the people within the sampled housing units are to others within their area. The Census estimates sampling error based on the population and its extent of variability.

Unlike the every-10-year census, the ACS survey continues all year, every year by randomly sampling addresses in every state, thus creating a \u201crolling average\u201d of data about designated geographic regions to generate up-to-date statistics used by many federal, state, tribal, and local leaders. The U.S. decennial census is to provides counts of people for the purpose of Congressional apportionment, the ACS measures the changing social and economic characteristics of the U.S. population. The ACS does not provide official counts of the population in between censuses. Some American Community Survey questions have been asked by the census since it first began in 1790. Because ACS data are collected continuously, they are not always comparable to data collected from the decennial census. For example, in the case of employment statistics, both surveys ask about employment status during the week prior to the survey. However, data from the decennial census are typically collected between March and August, whereas data from the ACS are collected each month and reflect employment throughout the year. Differences in these responses may in turn affect data on commuting, occupation, and industry. It is anticipated that the short form (age, gender, race) will continue to be distributed to all households every 10 years. A major advantage of the ACS is ensuring communities with residents in group housing get a fair share of federal funds. Group housing facilities (also called \"group quarters\") are randomly selected throughout the year depending on the size of your facility. It is the extra attention to detail that reduces some of the common and seemingly unavoidable errors generated by the previous long form.

Unlike the every-10-year census, the ACS survey continues all year, every year by randomly sampling addresses in every state, thus creating a \u201crolling average\u201d of data about designated geographic regions to generate up-to-date statistics used by many federal, state, tribal, and local leaders. The U.S. decennial census is to provides counts of people for the purpose of Congressional apportionment, the ACS measures the changing social and economic characteristics of the U.S. population. The ACS does not provide official counts of the population in between censuses. Some American Community Survey questions have been asked by the census since it first began in 1790. Because ACS data are collected continuously, they are not always comparable to data collected from the decennial census. For example, in the case of employment statistics, both surveys ask about employment status during the week prior to the survey. However, data from the decennial census are typically collected between March and August, whereas data from the ACS are collected each month and reflect employment throughout the year. Differences in these responses may in turn affect data on commuting, occupation, and industry. It is anticipated that the short form (age, gender, race) will continue to be distributed to all households every 10 years. A major advantage of the ACS is ensuring communities with residents in group housing get a fair share of federal funds. Group housing facilities (also called \"group quarters\") are randomly selected throughout the year depending on the size of your facility. It is the extra attention to detail that reduces some of the common and seemingly unavoidable errors generated by the previous long form.

the social and operational performance of small businesses, based on key measures of business health and success found in the scientific literature. The survey was sent electronically to approximately 14,000 small business owners from Energize Colorado\u2019s database. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and statistical tests measuring the correlation between the SBRI, demographics, and overall business performance, in order to understand predictors of small business resilience.  The Small Business Resilience Index seeks to quantifiably measure the small business ecosystem in order to improve the resilience of small businesses and provide future guidance to small business owners, associations, and governmental leaders in Colorado. Our index is composed of two, interrelated metrics of Resilience Capital: 1) Social Capital, and 2) Operational Capital. Together, these two data sets when combined are referred to as the Small Business Resilience Index (SBRI).  About Energize Colorado Small businesses and entrepreneurs are the backbone of Colorado\u2019s economy. If they thrive, the communities they operate in thrive. Founded in the wake of COVID-19, but with a long-term mission, Energize Colorado is a nonprofit organization that aims to advance resilience and inclusivity in Colorado\u2019s small business ecosystem. Led by innovative leaders and powered by seasoned volunteers from across Colorado, we leverage our networks and entrepreneurial know-how to advocate on behalf of our small business community. By providing access to capital, free resources, and creating new programs to meet the needs of small businesses, we\u2019re working to bridge the racial and economic divides in Colorado."}, {"key": "Data-Description_Field-Names,-comma-delimited", "value": "survey_date, company_zip, number_locations, full_time_employees, part_time_employees, contract_employees, 12_month_revenue, Q_My company receives good and timely information when regulations change., Q_My company can easily get information about business assistance programs., Q_My employees have access to essential on the job education and training., Q_My employees have the necessary skillsets and knowledge required to make my business successful., Q_My company communicates regularly with other businesses in the area similar to my own., Q_My company receives advice/mentorship from external advisors (formal or informal)., Q_My company is connected to organizations or associations designed to help businesses like mine (e.g. chamber of commerce, Colorado Bioscience Association)., Q_My company plans on hiring more people in the next 12 months., Q_My company has had higher voluntary employee turnover (quitting) than normal in the last 12 months., Q_My company has had higher involuntary employee turnover (termination due to economic hardship) than normal in the last 12 months., Q_My company\u2019s operations are efficient and can adjust rapidly (as needed)., Q_My company can currently meet the demands of my customers., Q_My company\u2019s current ability to meet customer needs is negatively impacted by external forces (e.g., suppliers, environmental)., Q_How have your sales increased or decreased over the last year?, Q_How has your profit increased or decreased over the last year?, Q_My company has enough cash on hand to meet my business needs for the next 12 months., Q_My company is currently seeking additional funding (outside of current sources) to run my business., Q_My customers have the resources and stability to continue buying my service / product., Q_How do you currently measure the performance of your business?, Q_My company often uses and seeks new technology to assist and complete our work., Q_My company often uses and seeks new technology to connect with customers., Q_My company often invests in online/digital security tools to protect company and customer data., Q_I am able to implement new technology solutions and programs successfully into my business operations (either myself or with assistance)., Q_I am able to use multiple methods of marketing (email, social media, phone service) to engage/support my customers., Q_What is your monthly spend for your website and digital solutions for Customer Growth?, Q_What is your monthly spend for your website and digital solutions for Operational Efficiency?, Q_What is your monthly spend for your website and digital solutions for Online/Digital Security?, Q_What is your monthly spend for your website and digital solutions for Point of Sale Solutions?, Q_What is your monthly spend for your website and digital solutions for Employee Recruitment?, Q_What is your monthly spend for your website and digital solutions for Website Design and Maintenance?, Q_What is your monthly spend for your website and digital solutions for Other?, Q_What is your monthly spend for your website and digital solutions for Other?.1, Q_If my primary method of serving my customers was disrupted, I could adapt and change my means of customer delivery., Q_I frequently seek new ways and avenues of growing my business (new delivery methods, new technology, etc.)., Q_My company would be able to continue to operate if there was another lockdown today., Q_To what degree was your business affected by the pandemic and related lockdowns?, Q_To what degree was your business affected by the pandemic and related lockdowns?

Colorado. Types, numbers, acreage, and expenses of conservation easements held by charitable organizations as reported to the IRS in annual filings using Form 990, and provided by the Colorado Department of State (CDOS). This information comes from Schedule D, Part II, lines 1-9 of IRS Form 990 (2016 version). Only organizations that answered \"Yes\" on Form 990, Part IV, line 7, \"Did the organization receive or hold a conservation easement, including easements to preserve open space, the environment, historic land areas, or historic structures?\" complete Part III of Schedule D. In addition to reporting on conservation easements, also report in Part II other interests in real property that under state law have attributes similar to a conservation easement and are established for the purpose of conservation and preservation (for example, certain restrictive covenants and equitable servitudes). Don\u2019t report utility easements. Line 1. Check the box for the purpose or purposes for which the organization held the easement(s) during the tax year. Check all that apply. Line 2. Provide an answer for each item. Line 2a. Enter the total number of conservation easements held by the organization at the end of the tax year. This shouldn\u2019t be an estimate or a rounded number. Line 2b. Enter the total acreage restricted by conservation easements held by the organization at the end of the tax year. Compute the total acreage by adding together all the acres of land subject to all the easements held as of the end of the tax year. Don\u2019t include conservation easements on certified historic structures. Acreage can be expressed in decimal points for properties subject to easements where the acreage consists of less than whole numbers. For example, two and one-half acres can be expressed as 2.5 acres. Line 2c. Enter the number of conservation easements on certified historic structures held by the organization at the end of the tax year. A certified historic structure is any building or structure listed in the National Register of Historic Places as well as any building certified as being of historic significance to a registered historic district. See section 170(h)(4)(B) for special rules that apply to contributions of conservation easements on certified historic structures in registered historic districts. Line 2d. Enter the number of conservation easements included in the answer to line 2c that the organization acquired after July 25, 2006, and not on a historic structure listed in the National Register. Line 3. To be eligible for a federal charitable income tax deduction for the donation of a conservation easement to a qualified organization, the easement must be granted in perpetuity. For purposes of maintaining its tax exemption, the recipient tax-exempt organization generally must protect the conservation easements it holds in perpetuity. Enter the total number of conservation easements held by the organization that were modified, transferred, released, extinguished, or terminated, in whole or in part, during the tax year. For example, if two easements were modified and one easement was terminated during the tax year, enter the number 3. For each easement modified, transferred, released, extinguished, or terminated, in whole or in part, explain the changes in Part XIII. Tax exemption may be undermined by the modification, transfer, release, extinguishment, or termination of an easement. For purposes of this Schedule D reporting requirement, an easement is modified when its terms are amended or altered in any manner. For example, if the deed of easement is amended to increase the amount of land subject to the easement or to add, alter, or remove restrictions regarding the use of the property subject to the easement, the easement is modified. An easement is transferred if, for example, the organization assigns, sells, releases, quitclaims, or otherwise disposes of the easement whether with or without consideration. An easement is released, extinguished, or terminated when it is condemned, extinguished by court order, transferred to the land owner, or in any way rendered void and unenforceable, in each case whether in whole or in part. An easement is also released, extinguished, or terminated when all or part of the property subject to the easement is removed from the protection of the easement in exchange for the protection of some other property or cash to be used to protect some other property. The categories described in the preceding paragraph are provided for convenience purposes only and aren\u2019t to be considered legally binding or mutually exclusive. For example, a modification may also involve a transfer and an extinguishment, depending on the circumstances. Use of a synonym for any of these terms doesn\u2019t avoid the application of the reporting requirement. For example, calling an action a \u201cswap\u201d or a \u201cboundary line adjustment\u201d doesn\u2019t mean the action isn\u2019t also a modification, transfer, or extinguishment. Line 4. Enter the total number of states where property is located and subject to a conservation easement held by the organization during the tax year. Line 5. A qualified organization must have a commitment to protect the conservation purposes of the easement, and have the resources to enforce the restrictions. Report whether the organization has a written policy or policies about how the organization will monitor, inspect, and handle violations, and how it will enforce conservation easements. If \u201cYes,\u201d briefly summarize such policy or policies in Part XIII. Also, indicate whether such policy or policies are reflected in the organization\u2019s easement documents. Monitoring means the organization investigates the use or condition of the real property restricted by the easement to determine if the property owner is adhering to the restrictions imposed by the terms of the easement to ensure the conservation purpose of the easement is being achieved. Inspection means an onsite visit to observe the property to carry out a monitoring purpose. Enforcement of an easement means action taken by the organization after it discovers a violation to compel a property owner to adhere to the terms of the conservation easement. Such activities can include communications with the property owner explaining his or her obligations with respect to the easement, arbitration, or litigation. Line 6. Enter the total number of hours devoted during the tax year to monitoring, inspecting, handling -2- 2017 Instructions for Schedule D (Form 990) Page 3 of 6 Fileid: \u2026 s/I990SCHD/2017/A/XML/Cycle03/source 16:31 - 16-Nov-2017 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. violations, and enforcing conservation easements, as those terms are defined in the instructions for line 5 above. Include the hours devoted to this purpose by any of the organization\u2019s paid or unpaid staff and by any of the organization\u2019s agents or independent contractors. Line 7. Enter the total amount of expenses incurred by the organization during the tax year to monitor, inspect, handle violations, and enforce the conservation easements it held during the year as those terms are defined in the instructions for line 5. Line 8. Answer \u201cYes\u201d if each of the organization\u2019s fa\u00e7ade easements acquired after July 25, 2006, satisfies the requirements of sections 170(h)(4)(B)(i) and 170(h)(4)(B)(ii). Section 170(h)(4)(B)(i) requires each fa\u00e7ade easement donated after August 17, 2006, to include a restriction that preserves the entire exterior of the building, including the front, sides, rear, and height of the building, and to prohibit any change in the exterior of the building that is inconsistent with the historical character of such exterior. Section 170(h)(4)(B)(ii) requires the donor and donee to enter into a written agreement certifying, among other things, that the donee organization has the resources to manage and enforce the restriction and a commitment to do so. Line 9. Enter in Part XIII a description of how the organization reports conservation easements in its revenue and expense statement and on its balance sheet. Include in Part XIII, if applicable, the text of the footnote to the organization\u2019s financial statements that describes the organization\u2019s accounting for conservation easements and the basis for its reporting position (for example, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 02-7, Example 1 (now codified in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350-30-55-29 to 55-32)). The organization must report any qualified conservation contributions and contributions of conservation easements in Form 990, Part VIII, Statement of Revenue; Schedule A (Form 990 or 990-EZ), Public Charity Status and Public Support; Schedule B (Form 990, 990-EZ, or 990-PF), Schedule of Contributors; and Schedule M (Form 990), Noncash Contributions, consistently with how it CAUTION ! reports revenue from such contributions in its books, records, and financial statements."}, {"key": "Data-Description_Single-Row", "value": "Charitable organization name and address, EIN, type, number, acreage, and expense of conservation easements"}, {"key": "Data-Description_Oldest-Record-in-Dataset", "value": 2011}, {"key": "Data-Description_Data-Collection-Instrument", "value": "e-Filing"}, {"key": "Data-Description_Collection-Method", "value": "Data is updated from the IRS monthly, extracted, transformed, and loaded to the Colorado Department of State."}, {"key": "Additional-Dataset-Documentation_Data-Dictionary", "value": ""}, {"key": "Additional-Dataset-Documentation_Additional-Metadata", "value": ""}, {"key": "Additional-Dataset-Documentation_Technical-Documentation", "value": ""}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Expected-Update-Frequency", "value": "Static"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.colorado.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.colorado.gov/d/u4xw-xiec", "link": "https://data.colorado.gov/Business/Conservation-Easements-for-Charities-Operating-in-/u4xw-xiec", "owner": {"id": "8cet-tw9x", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Colorado Information Marketplace"}, "creator": {"id": "8cet-tw9x", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Colorado Information Marketplace"}}

The State of Colorado created a first-of-its-kind watershed restoration program utilizing funding from U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Through Community Development Block Grant \u2013 Disaster Recovery funds, the Watershed Resilience Pilot Program provides grants to watershed coalitions for staff support and resilient river restoration projects.

Sampling errors are misrepresentations of a larger population based on the selection of the representative sample. Accuracy of the estimates depend in part on how typical the people within the sampled housing units are to others within their area. The Census estimates sampling error based on the population and its extent of variability.

Household fields include: Total Households, Total Families, Households by Household Type by Household Size, Persons in Group Quarters by Detailed Group Quarters Type, Persons 25 Years and Over by Educational Attainment, Persons 16 Years and Over by Labor Force and Employment Status, Median Household Income, Median Family Income, Per Capita Income, Persons by Poverty Status in Previous Year.

Unlike the every-10-year census, the ACS survey continues all year, every year by randomly sampling addresses in every state, thus creating a \u201crolling average\u201d of data about designated geographic regions to generate up-to-date statistics used by many federal, state, tribal, and local leaders. The U.S. decennial census is to provides counts of people for the purpose of Congressional apportionment, the ACS measures the changing social and economic characteristics of the U.S. population. The ACS does not provide official counts of the population in between censuses. Some American Community Survey questions have been asked by the census since it first began in 1790. Because ACS data are collected continuously, they are not always comparable to data collected from the decennial census. For example, in the case of employment statistics, both surveys ask about employment status during the week prior to the survey. However, data from the decennial census are typically collected between March and August, whereas data from the ACS are collected each month and reflect employment throughout the year. Differences in these responses may in turn affect data on commuting, occupation, and industry. It is anticipated that the short form (age, gender, race) will continue to be distributed to all households every 10 years. A major advantage of the ACS is ensuring communities with residents in group housing get a fair share of federal funds. Group housing facilities (also called \"group quarters\") are randomly selected throughout the year depending on the size of your facility. It is the extra attention to detail that reduces some of the common and seemingly unavoidable errors generated by the previous long form.
