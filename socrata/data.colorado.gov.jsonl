Unlike the every-10-year census, the ACS survey continues all year, every year by randomly sampling addresses in every state, thus creating a \u201crolling average\u201d of data about designated geographic regions to generate up-to-date statistics used by many federal, state, tribal, and local leaders. The U.S. decennial census is to provides counts of people for the purpose of Congressional apportionment, the ACS measures the changing social and economic characteristics of the U.S. population. The ACS does not provide official counts of the population in between censuses. Some American Community Survey questions have been asked by the census since it first began in 1790. Because ACS data are collected continuously, they are not always comparable to data collected from the decennial census. For example, in the case of employment statistics, both surveys ask about employment status during the week prior to the survey. However, data from the decennial census are typically collected between March and August, whereas data from the ACS are collected each month and reflect employment throughout the year. Differences in these responses may in turn affect data on commuting, occupation, and industry. It is anticipated that the short form (age, gender, race) will continue to be distributed to all households every 10 years. A major advantage of the ACS is ensuring communities with residents in group housing get a fair share of federal funds. Group housing facilities (also called \"group quarters\") are randomly selected throughout the year depending on the size of your facility. It is the extra attention to detail that reduces some of the common and seemingly unavoidable errors generated by the previous long form.

Overcounts are known to exist in student and dual-residence populations, while undercounts are a given for homeless and illegal immigrants. Errors arise from both sampling and non-sampling methods. Sampling errors are misrepresentations of a larger population based on the selection of the representative sample. Accuracy of the estimates depend in part on how typical the people within the sampled housing units are to others within their area. The Census estimates sampling error based on the population and its extent of variability. The long-form of the Census is distributed to a subset of households, and includes additional data related to households, economy, employment, occupation, as well as occupancy and building structure data. Household fields include: Total Households, Total Families, Households by Household Type by Household Size, Persons in Group Quarters by Detailed Group Quarters Type, Persons 25 Years and Over by Educational Attainment, Persons 16 Years and Over by Labor Force and Employment Status, Median Household Income, Median Family Income, Per Capita Income, Persons by Poverty Status in Previous Year.

No livestock water tanks can be used for irrigation purposes.\r\nErosion control dams are governed under Colorado statute (see section 37-87-122, C.R.S. (1990). These types of structures may be constructed on water courses which have been determined by the state engineer to be normally dry (which for our purposes is dry more than 80% of the time). Structures of this type cannot exceed fifteen feet from the bottom of the channel to the bottom of the spillway and cannot exceed ten acre-feet at the emergency spillway level. The height of the dam is measured vertically from the lowest point of the upstream toe to the crest of the dam in contrast to those measured vertically from the centerline pursuant to section 37-87-105, C.R.S.

More information regarding the types of industries included in each category can be found at the following website: www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/ "}, {"key": "Data-Description_Single-Row", "value": "County restaurant sales per quarter"}, {"key": "Data-Description_Oldest-Record-in-Dataset", "value": 2008}, {"key": "Data-Description_Data-Collection-Instrument", "value": ""}, {"key": "Data-Description_Collection-Method", "value": ""}, {"key": "Additional-Dataset-Documentation_Technical-Documentation", "value": ""}, {"key": "Additional-Dataset-Documentation_Data-Dictionary", "value": ""}, {"key": "Additional-Dataset-Documentation_Additional-Metadata", "value": ""}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Expected-Update-Frequency", "value": "Static"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.colorado.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.colorado.gov/d/rjvq-j29g", "link": "https://data.colorado.gov/Revenue/Restaurant-Sales-in-Colorado/rjvq-j29g", "owner": {"id": "8cet-tw9x", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Colorado Information Marketplace"}, "creator": {"id": "8cet-tw9x", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Colorado Information Marketplace"}}

Unlike the every-10-year census, the ACS survey continues all year, every year by randomly sampling addresses in every state, thus creating a \u201crolling average\u201d of data about designated geographic regions to generate up-to-date statistics used by many federal, state, tribal, and local leaders. The U.S. decennial census is to provides counts of people for the purpose of Congressional apportionment, the ACS measures the changing social and economic characteristics of the U.S. population. The ACS does not provide official counts of the population in between censuses. Some American Community Survey questions have been asked by the census since it first began in 1790. Because ACS data are collected continuously, they are not always comparable to data collected from the decennial census. For example, in the case of employment statistics, both surveys ask about employment status during the week prior to the survey. However, data from the decennial census are typically collected between March and August, whereas data from the ACS are collected each month and reflect employment throughout the year. Differences in these responses may in turn affect data on commuting, occupation, and industry. It is anticipated that the short form (age, gender, race) will continue to be distributed to all households every 10 years. A major advantage of the ACS is ensuring communities with residents in group housing get a fair share of federal funds.

Unlike the every-10-year census, the ACS survey continues all year, every year by randomly sampling addresses in every state, thus creating a \u201crolling average\u201d of data about designated geographic regions to generate up-to-date statistics used by many federal, state, tribal, and local leaders. The U.S. decennial census is to provides counts of people for the purpose of Congressional apportionment, the ACS measures the changing social and economic characteristics of the U.S. population. The ACS does not provide official counts of the population in between censuses. Some American Community Survey questions have been asked by the census since it first began in 1790. Because ACS data are collected continuously, they are not always comparable to data collected from the decennial census. For example, in the case of employment statistics, both surveys ask about employment status during the week prior to the survey. However, data from the decennial census are typically collected between March and August, whereas data from the ACS are collected each month and reflect employment throughout the year. Differences in these responses may in turn affect data on commuting, occupation, and industry. It is anticipated that the short form (age, gender, race) will continue to be distributed to all households every 10 years. A major advantage of the ACS is ensuring communities with residents in group housing get a fair share of federal funds. Group housing facilities (also called \"group quarters\") are randomly selected throughout the year depending on the size of your facility. It is the extra attention to detail that reduces some of the common and seemingly unavoidable errors generated by the previous long form.

Together, these two data sets when combined are referred to as the Small Business Resilience Index (SBRI).

Founded in the wake of COVID-19, but with a long-term mission, Energize Colorado is a nonprofit organization that aims to advance resilience and inclusivity in Colorado\u2019s small business ecosystem.

Accuracy of the estimates depend in part on how typical the people within the sampled housing units are to others within their area. The Census estimates sampling error based on the population and its extent of variability. The long-form of the Census is distributed to a subset of households, and includes additional data related to households, economy, employment, occupation, as well as occupancy and building structure data. Household fields include: Total Households, Total Families, Households by Household Type by Household Size, Persons in Group Quarters by Detailed Group Quarters Type, Persons 25 Years and Over by Educational Attainment, Persons 16 Years and Over by Labor Force and Employment Status, Median Household Income, Median Family Income, Per Capita Income, Persons by Poverty Status in Previous Year. Occupancy fields include: Total Housing Units, Housing Units by Occupancy Status, Vacant Housing Units by Vacancy Status, Occupied Housing Units by Tenure, Median Housing Value, Median Contract Rent."}, {"key": "Data-Description_Single-Row", "value": "Census congressional districts demographics"}, {"key": "Data-Description_Oldest-Record-in-Dataset", "value": ""}, {"key": "Data-Description_Data-Collection-Instrument", "value": "Surveys"}, {"key": "Data-Description_Collection-Method", "value": "The 2000 census marked the last year that the long form was distributed to 1 in 6 households (a 17% sample), and in 2010 the actual sample size for the long form was 2.5% per year (totaling 12.5% over a 5 year cycle).

A certified historic structure is any building or structure listed in the National Register of Historic Places as well as any building certified as being of historic significance to a registered historic district. See section 170(h)(4)(B) for special rules that apply to contributions of conservation easements on certified historic structures in registered historic districts. Line 2d. Enter the number of conservation easements included in the answer to line 2c that the organization acquired after July 25, 2006, and not on a historic structure listed in the National Register. Line 3. To be eligible for a federal charitable income tax deduction for the donation of a conservation easement to a qualified organization, the easement must be granted in perpetuity. For purposes of maintaining its tax exemption, the recipient tax-exempt organization generally must protect the conservation easements it holds in perpetuity. Enter the total number of conservation easements held by the organization that were modified, transferred, released, extinguished, or terminated, in whole or in part, during the tax year. For example, if two easements were modified and one easement was terminated during the tax year, enter the number 3. For each easement modified, transferred, released, extinguished, or terminated, in whole or in part, explain the changes in Part XIII. Tax exemption may be undermined by the modification, transfer, release, extinguishment, or termination of an easement. For purposes of this Schedule D reporting requirement, an easement is modified when its terms are amended or altered in any manner. For example, if the deed of easement is amended to increase the amount of land subject to the easement or to add, alter, or remove restrictions regarding the use of the property subject to the easement, the easement is modified. An easement is transferred if, for example, the organization assigns, sells, releases, quitclaims, or otherwise disposes of the easement whether with or without consideration. An easement is released, extinguished, or terminated when it is condemned, extinguished by court order, transferred to the land owner, or in any way rendered void and unenforceable, in each case whether in whole or in part. An easement is also released, extinguished, or terminated when all or part of the property subject to the easement is removed from the protection of the easement in exchange for the protection of some other property or cash to be used to protect some other property. The categories described in the preceding paragraph are provided for convenience purposes only and aren\u2019t to be considered legally binding or mutually exclusive. For example, a modification may also involve a transfer and an extinguishment, depending on the circumstances. Use of a synonym for any of these terms doesn\u2019t avoid the application of the reporting requirement. For example, calling an action a \u201cswap\u201d or a \u201cboundary line adjustment\u201d doesn\u2019t mean the action isn\u2019t also a modification, transfer, or extinguishment. Line 4. Enter the total number of states where property is located and subject to a conservation easement held by the organization during the tax year. Line 5. A qualified organization must have a commitment to protect the conservation purposes of the easement, and have the resources to enforce the restrictions. Report whether the organization has a written policy or policies about how the organization will monitor, inspect, and handle violations, and how it will enforce conservation easements. If \u201cYes,\u201d briefly summarize such policy or policies in Part XIII. Also, indicate whether such policy or policies are reflected in the organization\u2019s easement documents. Monitoring means the organization investigates the use or condition of the real property restricted by the easement to determine if the property owner is adhering to the restrictions imposed by the terms of the easement to ensure the conservation purpose of the easement is being achieved. Inspection means an onsite visit to observe the property to carry out a monitoring purpose. Enforcement of an easement means action taken by the organization after it discovers a violation to compel a property owner to adhere to the terms of the conservation easement. Such activities can include communications with the property owner explaining his or her obligations with respect to the easement, arbitration, or litigation. Line 6. Enter the total number of hours devoted during the tax year to monitoring, inspecting, handling -2- 2017 Instructions for Schedule D (Form 990) Page 3 of 6 Fileid: \u2026 s/I990SCHD/2017/A/XML/Cycle03/source 16:31 - 16-Nov-2017 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. violations, and enforcing conservation easements, as those terms are defined in the instructions for line 5 above. Include the hours devoted to this purpose by any of the organization\u2019s paid or unpaid staff and by any of the organization\u2019s agents or independent contractors. Line 7. Enter the total amount of expenses incurred by the organization during the tax year to monitor, inspect, handle violations, and enforce the conservation easements it held during the year as those terms are defined in the instructions for line 5. Line 8. Answer \u201cYes\u201d if each of the organization\u2019s fa\u00e7ade easements acquired after July 25, 2006, satisfies the requirements of sections 170(h)(4)(B)(i) and 170(h)(4)(B)(ii). Section 170(h)(4)(B)(i) requires each fa\u00e7ade easement donated after August 17, 2006, to include a restriction that preserves the entire exterior of the building, including the front, sides, rear, and height of the building, and to prohibit any change in the exterior of the building that is inconsistent with the historical character of such exterior. Section 170(h)(4)(B)(ii) requires the donor and donee to enter into a written agreement certifying, among other things, that the donee organization has the resources to manage and enforce the restriction and a commitment to do so. Line 9. Enter in Part XIII a description of how the organization reports conservation easements in its revenue and expense statement and on its balance sheet. Include in Part XIII, if applicable, the text of the footnote to the organization\u2019s financial statements that describes the organization\u2019s accounting for conservation easements and the basis for its reporting position (for example, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 02-7, Example 1 (now codified in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350-30-55-29 to 55-32)). The organization must report any qualified conservation contributions and contributions of conservation easements in Form 990, Part VIII, Statement of Revenue; Schedule A (Form 990 or 990-EZ), Public Charity Status and Public Support; Schedule B (Form 990, 990-EZ, or 990-PF), Schedule of Contributors; and Schedule M (Form 990), Noncash Contributions, consistently with how it CAUTION ! reports revenue from such contributions in its books, records, and financial statements."}, {"key": "Data-Description_Single-Row", "value": "Charitable organization name and address, EIN, type, number, acreage, and expense of conservation easements"}, {"key": "Data-Description_Oldest-Record-in-Dataset", "value": 2011}, {"key": "Data-Description_Data-Collection-Instrument", "value": "e-Filing"}, {"key": "Data-Description_Collection-Method", "value": "Data is updated from the IRS monthly, extracted, transformed, and loaded to the Colorado Department of State."}, {"key": "Additional-Dataset-Documentation_Technical-Documentation", "value": ""}, {"key": "Additional-Dataset-Documentation_Data-Dictionary", "value": ""}, {"key": "Additional-Dataset-Documentation_Additional-Metadata", "value": ""}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Expected-Update-Frequency", "value": "Static"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.colorado.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.colorado.gov/d/u4xw-xiec", "link": "https://data.colorado.gov/Business/Conservation-Easements-for-Charities-Operating-in-/u4xw-xiec", "owner": {"id": "8cet-tw9x", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Colorado Information Marketplace"}, "creator": {"id": "8cet-tw9x", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Colorado Information Marketplace"}}

Overcounts are known to exist in student and dual-residence populations, while undercounts are a given for homeless and illegal immigrants. Errors arise from both sampling and non-sampling methods. Sampling errors are misrepresentations of a larger population based on the selection of the representative sample. Accuracy of the estimates depend in part on how typical the people within the sampled housing units are to others within their area. The Census estimates sampling error based on the population and its extent of variability. The long-form of the Census is distributed to a subset of households, and includes additional data related to households, economy, employment, occupation, as well as occupancy and building structure data. Household fields include: Total Households, Total Families, Households by Household Type by Household Size, Persons in Group Quarters by Detailed Group Quarters Type, Persons 25 Years and Over by Educational Attainment, Persons 16 Years and Over by Labor Force and Employment Status, Median Household Income, Median Family Income, Per Capita Income, Persons by Poverty Status in Previous Year. Occupancy fields include: Total Housing Units, Housing Units by Occupancy Status, Vacant Housing Units by Vacancy Status, Occupied Housing Units by Tenure, Median Housing Value, Median Contract Rent."}, {"key": "Data-Description_Single-Row", "value": "Decennial census core base statistical demographics"}, {"key": "Data-Description_Oldest-Record-in-Dataset", "value": ""}, {"key": "Data-Description_Data-Collection-Instrument", "value": ""}, {"key": "Data-Description_Collection-Method", "value": ""}, {"key": "Additional-Dataset-Documentation_Technical-Documentation", "value": ""}, {"key": "Additional-Dataset-Documentation_Data-Dictionary", "value": ""}, {"key": "Additional-Dataset-Documentation_Additional-Metadata", "value": ""}, {"key": "Data-Quality_Expected-Update-Frequency", "value": "Static"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.colorado.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.colorado.gov/d/uzap-vkkz", "link": "https://data.colorado.gov/Demographics/Census-Core-Based-Statistical-Area-in-Colorado-201/uzap-vkkz", "owner": {"id": "8cet-tw9x", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Colorado Information Marketplace"}, "creator": {"id": "8cet-tw9x", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Colorado Information Marketplace"}}

Anyone with a current hunting/fishing license, or boat, snowmobile, ATV registration is already covered by the fund.\r\n\r\nThe card is not insurance and does not reimburse individuals nor does it pay for medical transport. Medical transport includes helicopter flights or ground ambulance. If aircraft are used as a search vehicle, those costs are reimbursed by the fund. If the aircraft becomes a medical transport due to a medical emergency, the medical portion of the transport is not covered.\r\n\r\nThe CORSAR cards are available for $3 for one year and $12 for five years, and can be purchased at over 300 retailers in the state.", "attribution": "Department of Local Affairs", "attribution_link": "http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite/DOLA-Main/CBON/1251592090523", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-04-19T21:01:13.000Z", "createdAt": "2013-11-13T16:30:55.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-04-19T21:01:13.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2014-04-24T17:24:30.000Z", "columns_name": ["Address", "Phone #", "Address (state)", "Address (zip)", "Address (city)", "Address (address)", "Counties", "Region", "Vendor"], "columns_field_name": ["location", "phone", "location_state", "location_zip", "location_city", "location_address", ":@computed_region_nku6_53ud", "region", "vendor"], "columns_datatype": ["Point", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{"view": "address_coords", "align": "left"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2014-04-24T17:25:42.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["finance", "infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Recreation", "domain_tags": ["card", "corsar", "department", "dola", "local affairs", "rescue", "search", "search and rescue", "vendor"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.colorado.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.colorado.gov/d/vhyu-69jb", "link": "https://data.colorado.gov/Recreation/Colorado-Search-Rescue-Card-Vendors/vhyu-69jb", "owner": {"id": "fjxp-pzgm", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "camillid"}, "creator": {"id": "fjxp-pzgm", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "camillid"}}

Unlike the every-10-year census, the ACS survey continues all year, every year by randomly sampling addresses in every state, thus creating a \u201crolling average\u201d of data about designated geographic regions to generate up-to-date statistics used by many federal, state, tribal, and local leaders. The U.S. decennial census is to provides counts of people for the purpose of Congressional apportionment, the ACS measures the changing social and economic characteristics of the U.S. population. The ACS does not provide official counts of the population in between censuses. Some American Community Survey questions have been asked by the census since it first began in 1790. Because ACS data are collected continuously, they are not always comparable to data collected from the decennial census. For example, in the case of employment statistics, both surveys ask about employment status during the week prior to the survey. However, data from the decennial census are typically collected between March and August, whereas data from the ACS are collected each month and reflect employment throughout the year. Differences in these responses may in turn affect data on commuting, occupation, and industry. It is anticipated that the short form (age, gender, race) will continue to be distributed to all households every 10 years. A major advantage of the ACS is ensuring communities with residents in group housing get a fair share of federal funds. Group housing facilities (also called \"group quarters\") are randomly selected throughout the year depending on the size of your facility. It is the extra attention to detail that reduces some of the common and seemingly unavoidable errors generated by the previous long form.

Sampling errors are misrepresentations of a larger population based on the selection of the representative sample. Accuracy of the estimates depend in part on how typical the people within the sampled housing units are to others within their area. The Census estimates sampling error based on the population and its extent of variability. The long-form of the Census is distributed to a subset of households, and includes additional data related to households, economy, employment, occupation, as well as occupancy and building structure data. Household fields include: Total Households, Total Families, Households by Household Type by Household Size, Persons in Group Quarters by Detailed Group Quarters Type, Persons 25 Years and Over by Educational Attainment, Persons 16 Years and Over by Labor Force and Employment Status, Median Household Income, Median Family Income, Per Capita Income, Persons by Poverty Status in Previous Year.

This model uses hourly radiance images from geostationary weather satellites, daily snow cover data, and monthly averages of atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere to calculate the hourly total insolation (sun and sky) falling on a horizontal surface. The direct beam radiation is then calculated using the atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and aerosols, which are derived from a variety of sources.
