SUMMARY</strong>\nCase information on COVID-19 Laboratory testing. This data includes a daily count of test results reported, and how many of those were positive, negative, and indeterminate. Reported tests include tests with a positive, negative or indeterminate result. Indeterminate results, which could not conclusively determine whether COVID-19 virus was present, are not included in the calculation of percent positive. Testing for the novel coronavirus is available through commercial, clinical, and hospital laboratories, as well as the SFDPH Public Health Laboratory.\n\nTests are de-duplicated by an individual and date. This means that if a person gets tested multiple times on different dates in the last 30 days, all of those individual tests will be included in this data as individual tests (on each specimen collection date).\n\n<strong>Total positive test results is not equal to the total number of COVID-19 cases in San Francisco.</strong> Each positive test result is investigated. During this investigation, some test results are found to be for persons living outside of San Francisco and some are duplicates of previously received positive results. These are not included in the total San Francisco COVID-19 case count. Additionally, investigation of positive test results might not be completed on the day of receipt; new cases will be added to the total case count after full investigation and verification. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nLaboratory test volume and positivity for COVID-19 is based on electronic laboratory test reports. Deduplication, quality assurance measures and other data verification processes maximize accuracy of laboratory test information.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nDue to the high degree of variation in the time needed to complete tests by different labs there is a delay in this reporting. On March 24 the Health Officer ordered all labs in the City to report complete COVID-19 testing information to the local and state health departments. In order to track trends over time, a data user can analyze this data by \"result_date\" and see how the count of reported results and positivity rate have changed over time.\n\n<strong>E.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset represents probable or confirmed mpox cases among San Francisco residents. Cases are included by the episode date, defined as either the date when self-reported symptoms began or, if that date is not available, the date the positive test was collected (i.e., specimen collection date). \n\nData are lagged by 5 days, meaning that the most recent date of self-reported symptom or specimen collection included is 1 day prior to today. All data update daily as more information becomes available. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCase information is based on confirmed or probable positive laboratory tests reported to the San Francisco Department of Public Health. Processes to provide quality assurance and other data verification are completed before the data are reported. \n\nThis data may not be immediately available for recently reported cases because of the time needed to process tests and validate cases. \n\nData are continually updated to maximize completeness of information and reporting on San Francisco residents with confirmed or probable mpox.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates to the data are made through automated and manual processes once each day, Monday through Friday.  \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset shows new cases and cumulative cases (probable and confirmed) by episode date. Episode date is the date of self-reported symptom onset, or, if not available, date of specimen collection (i.e., the date the person was tested). \n\nNew cases are the count of cases with a symptom onset or specimen collection date on the given episode date.

The Plant Finder recommends appropriate habitat-building plants for sidewalks, gardens and roofs that are adapted to San Francisco's unique environment and climate.\r\n\r\nThe plants in the database include California natives and Mediterranean climate exotics. A large subset of the California natives are actually local San Francisco natives. We strongly recommend local natives since they provide the best habitat for local pollinators and other wildlife with whom they have co-evolved. San Francisco natives are the most closely adapted to the climate and environment of the San Francisco peninsula of course, and so they are the best in terms of water and soil conservation, ecosystem health, and overall sustainability.\r\n\r\nYou can get the geographic ares for plant communities represented in this dataset here: https://data.sfgov.org/d/27u4-a5b3", "attribution": "Cit and County of San Francisco Planning Department", "attribution_link": "http://sfplantfinder.org", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-09-06T00:44:44.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-06-28T17:25:11.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-09-06T00:44:44.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-06-28T17:25:33.000Z", "columns_name": ["Shady_Clay_int", "Flower_Color", "Suitable_Site_Conditions", "Super60", "Top20_int", "Water_Needs", "Soil_Type", "Sandy_Soil_int", "Top20", "Former_Latin_Name", "Climate_Appropriate_Plants", "Pruning_Needs", "Stormwater_int", "Nurseries", "Thrifty150", "Sidewalk_Landscaping_Plants", "Habitat_Value", "Stormwater_Benefit", "Appropriate_Location", "Suggested_Green_Connection_Routes", "Street_Tree_List", "Sidewalk_Landscaping_Plants_int", "Super60_int", "Shady_Clay", "Size_at_Maturity", "Common_Name", "Sandy_Soil", "Plant_Communities", "Associated_Wildlife", "Additional_Characteristices_Notes", "PhotoCredit02", "PhotoCredit04", "PhotoCredit01", "PhotoCredit03", "Additional_Species_Cultivars_Varieties", "Habitat_int", "Thrifty150_int", "Latin_Name", "Family_Name", "Special_List", "Plant_Type", "Bloom_Time", "Habitat"], "columns_field_name": ["shady_clay_int", "flower_color", "suitable_site_conditions", "super60", "top20_int", "water_needs", "soil_type", "sandy_soil_int", "top20", "former_latin_name", "climate_appropriate_plants", "pruning_needs", "stormwater_int", "nurseries", "thrifty150", "sidewalk_landscaping_plants", "habitat_value", "stormwater_benefit", "appropriate_location", "suggested_green_connection_routes", "street_tree_list", "sidewalk_landscaping_plants_int", "super60_int", "shady_clay", "size_at_maturity", "common_name", "sandy_soil", "plant_communities", "associated_wildlife", "additional_characteristices_notes", "photocredit02", "photocredit04", "photocredit01", "photocredit03", "additional_species_cultivars_varieties", "habitat_int", "thrifty150_int", "latin_name", "family_name", "special_list", "plant_type", "bloom_time", "habitat"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-06-28T17:31:59.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Energy and Environment", "domain_tags": ["environment", "green connections", "planning", "plant", "plantfinder", "plants", "sf plant finder"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Department-Metrics_Publishing-Department", "value": "Environment"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Publishing-frequency", "value": "Annually"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Data-change-frequency", "value": "Annually"}, {"key": "Detailed-Descriptive_Geographic-unit", "value": "Not applicable"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.sfgov.org", "license": "Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License"}, "permalink": "https://data.sfgov.org/d/vmnk-skih", "link": "https://data.sfgov.org/Energy-and-Environment/San-Francisco-Plant-Finder-Data/vmnk-skih", "owner": {"id": "wh9h-jktj", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "mikewynne"}, "creator": {"id": "wh9h-jktj", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "mikewynne"}}

A pedestrian safety zone is a painted buffered curb-side space between the sidewalk and moving vehicles. Their footprint resembles a bulb out, helping to emphasize that the space should not be treated as part of the roadway. As a low-cost, easily-implemented treatment, painted safety zones enhance pedestrian safety by (1) Improving line of sight between pedestrians and motorists and (2) Providing motorists with visual cues that encourage careful maneuvering near pedestrians. Painted safety zones do not extend the sidewalk, as pedestrians still wait to start their crossing at the existing curb line. However, their future conversion to concrete bulbouts will provide all the benefits of a wider sidewalk.\n\nB.

{"resource": {"name": "Dataset inventory", "id": "y8fp-fbf5", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>Annual Inventory Update Notice</strong>\nWe have updated the inventory with provisional update as of July 1, 2020 based on an initial cleanup and reconciliation of records. DataSF staff are delayed on a full update because of the ongoing COVID-19 response but are working with departments to complete that annual update by end of July.\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThe dataset inventory provides a list of data maintained by departments that are candidates for open data publishing or have already been published and is collected in accordance with Chapter 22D of the Administrative Code. The inventory will be used in conjunction with department publishing plans to track progress toward meeting plan goals for each department. Department publishing plans are available at https://datasf.org/publishing/plans\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis dataset is collated through 2 ways:\n1. Ongoing updates are made throughout the year to reflect new datasets, this process involves DataSF staff reconciling publishing records after datasets are published\n2. Annual bulk updates - departments review their inventories and identify changes and updates and submit those to DataSF for a once a year bulk update - not all departments will have changes or their changes will have been captured over the course of the prior year already as ongoing updates\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe dataset is synced automatically daily, but the underlying data changes manually throughout the year as needed\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\n<em>Interpreting dates in this dataset</em>\nThis dataset has 3 dates:\n1. Date Added - when the dataset was added to the inventory itself\n2. First Published - when the dataset was initially published on the platform\n3. Date Created on Platform - the open data portal automatically captures the date the dataset was first created, this is that system generated date\n\nNote that in certain cases we may have published a dataset prior to it being added to the inventory. We do our best to have an accurate accounting of when something was added to this inventory and when it was published. In most cases the inventory addition will happen prior to publishing, but in certain cases it will be published and we will have missed updating the inventory as this is a manual process. \n\nFirst published will give an  accounting of when it was actually available on the open data catalog and date added when it was added to this list. \n\nDate Created on Platform will show when a dataset was initially created. Because datasets are created and re-created as underlying systems changed, this date can be after the first published date if, for example, there was a new dataset published as an improvement over a previous one. Additionally, for new datasets, this date is often prior to the first published date as it is created, reviewed, QA'd and prepared for release.\n\n<em>Companion systems inventory dataset</em>\nThis is a list of datasets published and unpublished, a companion <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Inventory-of-citywide-enterprise-systems-of-record/ebux-gcnq\">dataset of citywide enterprise systems of record can be accessed online</a> as well.", "attribution": "GSA - City Administrator's Office: DataSF", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-04-30T07:37:20.000Z", "createdAt": "2015-03-26T18:22:56.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-04-20T22:56:27.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-04-30T07:37:20.000Z", "columns_name": ["Date Added", "Dataset ID", "Date Created on Platform", "Data Classification", "Value", "Dataset Description", "Dataset Link", "Publishing Approach", "Publishing Status", "Category", "First Published", "Inventory ID", "Automated By", "Department or Division", "Dataset Name", "Department Priority"], "columns_field_name": ["date_added", "dataset_id", "date_created_on_platform", "data_classification", "value", "dataset_description", "dataset_link", "publishing_approach", "publishing_status", "category", "first_published", "inventory_id", "automated_by", "department_or_division", "dataset_name", "department_priority"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "URL", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["The date the dataset was added to the inventory.

The order in which you publish this data may be dependent on  the other considerations below.\n\nPriority 3 - Avoid scheduling these datasets at this point. Once we have scheduled Priority 1 and 2 data, we will revisit this list. Exception: if the data is historical (or won't require updating) and easy to publish, consider adding it to your Priority 2 group. \n\nPriority 4 - These datasets do not need to be scheduled until the rest of the datasets are scheduled in the publication plan.

SUMMARY</strong>\nSnapshot of San Francisco's Development Pipeline. Tracking of construction and entitlement activity based on data from Department of Building Inspection's Permit Tracking System and the Planning Department's Project & Permit Tracking System, processed quarterly. For more information please see http://sfplanning.org/pipeline-report\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe dataset is created by combining projects data from the City Planning Department and permit data from the Building Inspection Department to create a quarterly snapshot that shows when a project is filed to construction.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe Development Pipeline is updated as a quarterly snapshot of the construction development in the City of San Francisco.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nEach row or record is a project or permit. They are fitted with information such as address, block lot, project case number and spatial data that allow users to find the specific project. Each row also contains project specific information such as project description and details to illustrate the scope of the project.\n\n<strong>E. DATA NOTES </strong>\n\n<strong>Reporting Update</strong>\nSignificant data and systems improvements are underway to produce a more accurate quarterly pipeline, so the data may change at any time. Weekly and monthly data on Planning Applications and Building Permits can be accessed via the City's Open Data Portal.\n\n<strong>Change in Status Definitions</strong>\nThe following changes have been made in status definitions since the 2022 Q1 Pipeline Report to align the Quarterly Pipeline Reports with other Housing Reports (Housing Inventory and Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) Annual Progress)  <br>\n<strong> (1) Construction: </strong> projects that are authorized for construction deemed to be in the construction stage. A project is considered to be authorized for construction if it has:\no\tan issued full building permit, OR<br>\no\tan issued site permit with an approved first construction document<br>\nPast definition: projects that had their first inspection were deemed to be in the construction stage.<br>\n<strong> (2) Building Permit Issued: </strong> includes projects that have an issued site permit but don\u2019t yet have their first construction document. Housing units for these projects are not yet counted toward RHNA progress.<br>\nPast definition: included projects with any type of permit (site or full building permit) in the issued status.\n\nA data dictionary can be downloaded from the following link: \nhttps://sfplanninggis.s3.amazonaws.com/PipelineDataDictionary_10262022.xlsx", "attribution": "City and County of San Francisco, City Planning Department", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-12-22T00:56:01.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-12-13T21:27:46.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-12-22T00:56:01.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-12-13T21:35:39.000Z", "columns_name": ["PDR", "VISIT_EXIST", "MED_EXIST", "MEDNET", "MIPS", "MIPSNET", "PDR_EXIST", "CIENET", "RETNET", "RET", "RET_EXIST", "MIPS_EXIST", "PDRNET", "CIE", "NET_GSF", "TOTAL_GSF", "QTR", "Lat/Long", "DBIDESC", "Longitude", "PLANS", "SUD", "PDA", "HEIGHT_BUL", "ZONING", "NHOOD_41", "NHOOD_37", "PD", "DESCRIPT", "BPAPPLNO", "CASENO", "TENURE_TYPE", "AFF_TARGET", "Aff_Projection", "AFFORDABLENET", "Pipeline_Units", "DA", "CONTACTPH", "CONTACT", "UNITSNET", "TCOCFC_UNITS", "SPONSOR", "TCOCFC_DATE", "BESTDATE", "Entitled", "NAMEADDR", "BLKLOT", "ObjectID", "Analysis Neighborhoods", "Current Supervisor Districts", "PLANNER", "Current Police Districts", "SF Find Neighborhoods", "Neighborhoods", "LEGALIZATION", "HOTEL_ROOM_EXIST", "SECTION415", "VISITNET", "VISIT", "HOTEL_ROOM_NET", "HOTEL_ROOM_PROP", "LANDUSE", "YEAR", "UNITS", "Latitude", "CIE_EXIST", "YEAR_QTR", "MED", "BESTSTAT", "State Density ALL", "SD22", "ADU"], "columns_field_name": ["pdr", "visit_exist", "med_exist", "mednet", "mips", "mipsnet", "pdr_exist", "cienet", "retnet", "ret", "ret_exist", "mips_exist", "pdrnet", "cie", "net_gsf", "total_gsf", "qtr", "lat_long", "dbidesc", "longitude", "plans", "sud", "pda", "height_bul", "zoning", "nhood_41", "nhood_37", "pd", "descript", "bpapplno", "caseno", "tenure_type", "aff_target", "aff_projection", "affordablenet", "pipeline_units", "da", "contactph", "contact", "unitsnet", "tcocfc_units", "sponsor", "tcocfc_date", "bestdate", "entitled", "nameaddr", "blklot", "objectid", ":@computed_region_ajp5_b2md", ":@computed_region_26cr_cadq", "planner", ":@computed_region_qgnn_b9vv", ":@computed_region_6qbp_sg9q", ":@computed_region_jwn9_ihcz", "legalization", "hotel_room_exist", "section415", "visitnet", "visit", "hotel_room_net", "hotel_room_prop", "landuse", "year", "units", "latitude", "cie_exist", "year_qtr", "med", "beststat", "state_density_all", "sd22", "adu"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Point", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Checkbox", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Checkbox", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Checkbox"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "This column was automatically created in order to record in what polygon from the dataset 'Analysis Neighborhoods' (ajp5-b2md) the point in column 'lat_long' is located.

SUMMARY</strong>\n\n<strong><i>Please note that the \"Data Last Updated\" date on this page denotes the most recent DataSF update and does not reflect the most recent update to this dataset. To confirm the completeness of this dataset please contact the District Attorney's office at <u><a href=\u201dmailto:districtattorney@sfgov.org\u201d>districtattorney@sfgov.org</a></u>.</strong></i>\n\nThis data set includes all criminal cases prosecuted by the District Attorney\u2019s Office that have reached a final resolution, or disposition. A case is resolved when a final determination has been made in court (i.e., an acquittal, conviction, dismissal, or a judge finds a defendant has successfully completed diversion).\n\nA case may also be resolved through other means. For example, a case may be re-indicted, a defendant may be released to another agency's custody, etc. Because of the case tracking systems used in the San Francisco Superior Court, these cases are assigned new court numbers and thus show up as distinct cases in the data available to the District Attorney\u2019s Office. Lastly, sometimes a defendant will have multiple criminal cases related to the same incident or similar types of crimes. The defendant may plead guilty to one case, and in exchange, the other cases will be dropped. The San Francisco Superior Court codes these cases as \"1385 PC - Guilty Plea to Other Charge\".\n\nMore information about this dataset can be found under the \u201cCase Resolutions\u201d section on the <u><a href=\"https://sfdistrictattorney.org/policy/data-dashboards/#case-resolutions\">Data Dashboards page</a></u>\n\n<strong><i>Disclaimer: The San Francisco District Attorney's Office does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information as the data is subject to change as modifications and updates are completed.</strong></i>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\n\nWhen a case prosecuted by the District Attorney\u2019s Office reaches a final resolution, or disposition, relevant data is manually entered into the District Attorney Office's case management system. Data reports are pulled from this system on a semi-regular basis, cleaned, anonymized, and added to Open Data.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\n\nWe strive to update this dataset at the beginning of every week. However, the creation of this dataset requires a manual pull from the Office's case management system and is dependent on staff availability.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\n\nPlease review the \u201cCase Resolutions\u201d section on the <u><a href=\"https://sfdistrictattorney.org/policy/data-dashboards/#case-resolutions\">Data Dashboards page</a></u> for more information about this dataset.\n\n<strong>E.

Tracking of construction and entitlement activity based on data from Department of Building Inspection's Permit Tracking System and the Planning Department's Project & Permit Tracking System, processed quarterly. For more information please see http://sfplanning.org/pipeline-report\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe dataset is created by combining projects data from the City Planning Department and permit data from the Building Inspection Department to create a quarterly snapshot that shows when a project is filed to construction.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe Development Pipeline is updated as a quarterly snapshot of the construction development in the City of San Francisco.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nEach row or record is a project or permit. They are fitted with information such as address, block lot, project case number and spatial data that allow users to find the specific project. Each row also contains project specific information such as project description and details to illustrate the scope of the project.\n\n<strong>E. DATA NOTES </strong>\n\n<strong>Reporting Update</strong>\nSignificant data and systems improvements are underway to produce a more accurate quarterly pipeline, so the data may change at any time. Weekly and monthly data on Planning Applications and Building Permits can be accessed via the City's Open Data Portal.\n\n<strong>Change in Status Definitions</strong>\nThe following changes have been made in status definitions since the 2022 Q1 Pipeline Report to align the Quarterly Pipeline Reports with other Housing Reports (Housing Inventory and Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) Annual Progress)  <br>\n<strong> (1) Construction: </strong> projects that are authorized for construction deemed to be in the construction stage. A project is considered to be authorized for construction if it has:\no\tan issued full building permit, OR<br>\no\tan issued site permit with an approved first construction document<br>\nPast definition: projects that had their first inspection were deemed to be in the construction stage.<br>\n<strong> (2) Building Permit Issued: </strong> includes projects that have an issued site permit but don\u2019t yet have their first construction document. Housing units for these projects are not yet counted toward RHNA progress.<br>\nPast definition: included projects with any type of permit (site or full building permit) in the issued status.\n\nA data dictionary can be downloaded from the following link: \nhttps://sfplanninggis.s3.amazonaws.com/PipelineDataDictionary_10262022.xlsx", "attribution": "City and County of San Francisco, City Planning Department", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-12-01T02:41:39.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-12-01T02:26:46.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-12-01T02:41:39.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-12-01T02:41:27.000Z", "columns_name": ["BESTDATE", "BESTSTAT", "Entitled", "NAMEADDR", "BLKLOT", "LANDUSE", "ObjectID", "Analysis Neighborhoods", "Current Supervisor Districts", "Current Police Districts", "TCOCFC_DATE", "TCOCFC_UNITS", "UNITSNET", "VISIT_EXIST", "VISIT", "VISITNET", "HOTEL_ROOM_EXIST", "PD", "Pipeline_Units", "AFFORDABLENET", "Aff_Projection", "SECTION415", "AFF_TARGET", "TENURE_TYPE", "CASENO", "SD22", "NHOOD_37", "NHOOD_41", "BPAPPLNO", "DESCRIPT", "DBIDESC", "TOTAL_GSF", "CONTACT", "SPONSOR", "PLANNER", "HOTEL_ROOM_NET", "NET_GSF", "CIE_EXIST", "CIE", "CIENET", "ADU", "LEGALIZATION", "DA", "CONTACTPH", "SF Find Neighborhoods", "Neighborhoods", "State Density ALL", "HOTEL_ROOM_PROP", "MED_EXIST", "MED", "MEDNET", "MIPS_EXIST", "MIPS", "MIPSNET", "PDR_EXIST", "PDR", "PDRNET", "ZONING", "HEIGHT_BUL", "PDA", "SUD", "PLANS", "Longitude", "Latitude", "YEAR", "QTR", "YEAR_QTR", "Lat/Long", "RET_EXIST", "RET", "RETNET", "UNITS"], "columns_field_name": ["bestdate", "beststat", "entitled", "nameaddr", "blklot", "landuse", "objectid", ":@computed_region_ajp5_b2md", ":@computed_region_26cr_cadq", ":@computed_region_qgnn_b9vv", "tcocfc_date", "tcocfc_units", "unitsnet", "visit_exist", "visit", "visitnet", "hotel_room_exist", "pd", "pipeline_units", "affordablenet", "aff_projection", "section415", "aff_target", "tenure_type", "caseno", "sd22", "nhood_37", "nhood_41", "bpapplno", "descript", "dbidesc", "total_gsf", "contact", "sponsor", "planner", "hotel_room_net", "net_gsf", "cie_exist", "cie", "cienet", "adu", "legalization", "da", "contactph", ":@computed_region_6qbp_sg9q", ":@computed_region_jwn9_ihcz", "state_density_all", "hotel_room_prop", "med_exist", "med", "mednet", "mips_exist", "mips", "mipsnet", "pdr_exist", "pdr", "pdrnet", "zoning", "height_bul", "pda", "sud", "plans", "longitude", "latitude", "year", "qtr", "year_qtr", "lat_long", "ret_exist", "ret", "retnet", "units"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Text", "Checkbox", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Checkbox", "Checkbox", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Point", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "This column was automatically created in order to record in what polygon from the dataset 'Analysis Neighborhoods' (ajp5-b2md) the point in column 'lat_long' is located.
