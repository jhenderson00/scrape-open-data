SUMMARY</strong>\nThe dataset includes details of all building permit applications filed with the Department of Building Inspection. Permit numbers and associated information may be repeated in multiple rows if there are multiple addresses associated with the permit. To view the deduplicated building permits dataset with just the primary address, <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Housing-and-Buildings/Building-Permits-Deduplicated-on-Primary-Address/f2jc-ivnc\">click here</a></u>. Data is uploaded nightly by DBI. Users can view associated addenda, routing, and inspection information for each permit in the dataset online through DBI\u2019s Permit Tracking System <u><a href=\"https://dbiweb02.sfgov.org/dbipts/\">here</a></u>.\n\n<b> A full data dictionary for this dataset is available by <u><a href=\"https://datasf.gitbook.io/datasf-dataset-explainers/dbi-building-permits-and-permit-addenda-data/building-permits-data-dictionary\">clicking here.</a></u> </b>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe dataset is created by extracting permit characteristics and key dates (including permit filing, issuance, and completion dates) from DBI\u2019s Permit Tracking System.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe process that builds this dataset will run nightly and include all permits entered into the system up to the time of the refresh (see the \u201cdata as of\u201d column in the dataset).\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nUsers can use this dataset to search for all permits associated with a specific address or parcel number and view characteristics like addresses, permit descriptions of work, unit counts, valuations, etc. If the analytical objective is to measure permitting trends for all addresses, we recommend using the primary address building permits dataset.\n\n<b>Note:</b> if you need to open this dataset in Excel, use one of the pre-filtered datasets. Opening the main dataset in Excel will cause some data to be lost as there are more than one million rows in the full dataset.\n\n1. <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/p4e4-a5a7\">Building Permits filed on or after January 1, 2013</a></u>\n2. <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/4jpb-z4kk\">Building Permits filed before January 1, 2013</a></u> \n\n<strong>E.

This data includes a daily count of test results reported, and how many of those were positive, negative, and indeterminate. Reported tests include tests with a positive, negative or indeterminate result. Indeterminate results, which could not conclusively determine whether COVID-19 virus was present, are not included in the calculation of percent positive. Testing for the novel coronavirus is available through commercial, clinical, and hospital laboratories, as well as the SFDPH Public Health Laboratory.\n\nTests are de-duplicated by an individual and date. This means that if a person gets tested multiple times on different dates in the last 30 days, all of those individual tests will be included in this data as individual tests (on each specimen collection date).\n\n<strong>Total positive test results is not equal to the total number of COVID-19 cases in San Francisco.</strong>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nLaboratory test volume and positivity for COVID-19 is based on electronic laboratory test reports. Deduplication, quality assurance measures and other data verification processes maximize accuracy of laboratory test information.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nDue to the high degree of variation in the time needed to complete tests by different labs there is a delay in this reporting. On March 24 the Health Officer ordered all labs in the City to report complete COVID-19 testing information to the local and state health departments.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset lists each review step on a building permit or site permit addenda routing list. Addenda are the more specific or detailed plans for construction that are submitted for review after a site permit has been issued. This dataset details the review timeline and departmental involvement for permits and addenda. \n\nTo better understand a routing list, we recommend looking up a permit number on <u><a href=\"https://dbiweb02.sfgov.org/dbipts/\">DBI\u2019s online Permit Tracking System</a></u> and reviewing the table under \u201cAddenda details\u201d which lists all the departmental stations a permit is routed to for review.

{"resource": {"name": "San Francisco Ballot Propositions Database - Historical Ballot Propositions 1907-present", "id": "88s2-6ua9", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\n\nThe San Francisco Public Library is thrilled to share our dataset from the San Francisco Ballot Propositions Database on DataSF. This dataset contains full text of San Francisco ballot propositions dating back to 1907 and links to digitized PDF versions of the pamphlets for each election. \n\nVisit SFPL's <a href=\"https://sfpl.org/locations/main-library/government-information-center/san-francisco-government/san-francisco-1/san-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">San Francisco Ballot Propositions Database</a> for a keyword searchable interface and links to Voter Information pamphlets.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\n\nSan Francisco Public Library received a Library Services and Technology grant to finance the digital scanning and microfilming of the Library's print collection of voter information pamphlets and handbooks for San Francisco municipal elections. Although not complete, the collection dates back to 1907. Approximately 59,000 voter pamphlet pages, including 1,500 propositions, were digitized into PDF files. For some elections, separate pamphlets were created for each voting district or a combination of each voting district and political party, and there is no singular representative pamphlet which includes all of the candidates for that election. As a result, the hard copies of the various pamphlets were bound together to represent that particular election, and this resulted in extra-large digitized versions. \n\nBecause the PDF files of the voter pamphlets are images instead of text, they cannot be searched electronically. San Francisco Public Library staff developed the San Francisco Ballot Propositions Database to provide keyword access to San Francisco propositions, pass/fail outcomes and other information, and links to the full-text PDF Voter Information Pamphlet.\n \n<strong>C.

{"resource": {"name": "Traffic Crashes Resulting in Injury: Parties Involved", "id": "8gtc-pjc6", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis table contains all parties involved in a traffic crash resulting in an injury in the City of San Francisco. Fatality year-to-date crash data is obtained from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OME) death records, and only includes those cases that meet the San Francisco Vision Zero Fatality Protocol maintained by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH), San Francisco Police Department (SFPD), and San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). Injury crash data is obtained from SFPD\u2019s Interim Collision System for 2018 to YTD, Crossroads Software Traffic Collision Database (CR) for years 2013-2017 and the Statewide Integrated Transportation Record System (SWITRS) maintained by the California Highway Patrol for all years prior to 2013. Only crashes with valid geographic information are mapped. All geocodable crash data is represented on the simplified San Francisco street centerline model maintained by the Department of Public Works (SFDPW). Collision injury data is queried and aggregated on a quarterly basis. Crashes occurring at complex intersections with multiple roadways are mapped onto a single point and injury and fatality crashes occurring on highways are excluded.\n\nThe crash, party, and victim tables have a relational structure. The traffic crashes table contains information on each crash, one record per crash. The party table contains information from all parties involved in the crashes, one record per party. Parties are individuals involved in a traffic crash including drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and parked vehicles. The victim table contains information about each party injured in the collision, including any passengers. Injury severity is included in the victim table. \n\nFor example, a crash occurs (1 record in the crash table) that involves a driver party and a pedestrian party (2 records in the party table). Only the pedestrian is injured and thus is the only victim (1 record in the victim table). \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nTraffic crash injury data is collected from the California Highway Patrol 555 Crash Report as submitted by the police officer within 30 days after the crash occurred. All fields that match the SWITRS data schema are programmatically extracted, de-identified, geocoded, and loaded into TransBASE. See Section D below for details regarding TransBASE. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nAfter review by SFPD and SFDPH staff, the data is made publicly available approximately a month after the end of the previous quarter (May for Q1, August for Q2, November for Q3, and February for Q4). \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis data is being provided as public information as defined under San Francisco and California public records laws. SFDPH, SFMTA, and SFPD cannot limit or restrict the use of this data or its interpretation by other parties in any way. Where the data is communicated, distributed, reproduced, mapped, or used in any other way, the user should acknowledge TransBASE.sfgov.org as the source of the data, provide a reference to the original data source where also applicable, include the date the data was pulled, and note any caveats specified in the associated metadata documentation provided. However, users should not attribute their analysis or interpretation of this data to the City of San Francisco. While the data has been collected and/or produced for the use of the City of San Francisco, it cannot guarantee its accuracy or completeness. Accordingly, the City of San Francisco, including SFDPH, SFMTA, and SFPD make no representation as to the accuracy of the information or its suitability for any purpose and disclaim any liability for omissions or errors that may be contained therein.

{"resource": {"name": "Campaign Finance - Summary Totals", "id": "9ggq-m8hp", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset contains current summary information for electronically filed FPPC campaign forms. The columns in this dataset correspond to the figures reported on the summary page of FPPC forms 450, 460, 461, and 465. Refer to the <a href=\"https://fppc.ca.gov/forms.html\">FPPC Forms represented in this dataset</a>.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCommittees file campaign statements with the Ethics Commission on a periodic basis. Those statements are stored with the Commission's provider. Data is generally presented as-filed by committees.\nIf a committee files an amendment, the data from that filing completely replaces the original and any prior amendments in the filing sequence.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nEach night starting at midnight Pacific time a script runs to check for new filings with the Commission's database, and updates this dataset with transactions from new filings. The update process can take a variable amount of time to complete. Viewing or downloading this dataset while the update is running may result in incomplete data, therefore it is highly recommended to view or download this data before midnight or after 8am.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nTransactions from rejected and superseded filings are not included in this dataset. Transactions from many different FPPC forms are combined in this dataset, refer to the column \"Form Type\" to differentiate transaction types.\n\nA row with no value in the SyncFlag column indicates a paper filing amended an electronic filing. The SFEC is working on how to automatically deal with these cases.\n\nProperties suffixed with \"-nid\" can be used to join the data between Filers, Filings, and Transaction datasets.\n\nRefer to the <a href=\"https://sfethics.org/disclosures/campaign-finance-disclosure/campaign-finance-disclosure-data\">Ethics Commission's webpage</a> for more information.\n\n<strong>RELATED DATASETS</strong>\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Campaign-Finance-San-Francisco-Campaign-Filers/4c8t-ngau\">San Francisco Campaign Filers</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Campaign-Finance-Filings-Received-by-SFEC/qizs-bwft\">Filings Received by SFEC</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Campaign-Finance-Summary-Totals/9ggq-m8hp\">Summary Totals</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Campaign-Finance-Transactions/pitq-e56w\">Transactions</a></li>\n</ul>", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-09-16T08:19:29.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-03-01T23:23:00.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-10-03T20:24:20.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-09-16T08:19:29.000Z", "columns_name": ["Line 1 Col A", "Line 15 Col A", "Line 14 Col A", "Line 6 Col B", "Line 22C Col A", "Schedule I Line 3", "Line 7 Col A", "Sync Flag", "Line 1 Col B", "Line 12 Col A", "Line 21 Col A", "Schedule B1 Line 3", "Schedule A Line 1", "Line 21 Col B", "Line 5 Col B", "Line 7 Col B", "Filer Name", "Filing Date", "Line 17 Col A", "Filing Start Date", "Line 3 Col B", "Line 3 Col A", "Line 2 Col B", "FPPC Id", "Filer Nid", "Schedule I Line 2", "Schedule E Line 1", "Schedule D Line 1", "Schedule C Line 2", "Filing Nid", "Line 18 Col A", "Line 22A Col A", "Schedule A Line 3", "Latest Filing Activity Nid", "Data As Of", "Data Loaded At", "Filing Type", "Schedule F Line 1", "Schedule E Line 4", "Line 11 Col A", "Line 8 Col A", "Line 22B Col A", "Form Type", "Schedule H Line 2", "Line 20 Col B", "Schedule D Line 3", "Schedule B1 Line 2", "Schedule B1 Line 1", "Line 2 Col A", "Line 4 Col A", "Line 5 Col A", "Line 20 Col A", "Line 19 Col A", "Schedule E Line 3", "Schedule E Line 2", "Filer Type", "Schedule C Line 1", "Line 10 Col B", "Line 10 Col A", "Line 9 Col B", "Line 9 Col A", "Line 8 Col B", "Schedule C Line 3", "Schedule D Line 2", "Schedule F Line 2", "Line 6 Col A", "Schedule I Line 1", "Filing Id Number", "Filing End Date", "Line 4 Col B", "Line 13 Col A", "Line 16 Col A", "Schedule F Line 3", "Schedule H Line 1", "Schedule H Line 3", "Schedule I Line 4", "Schedule A Line 2", "Line 11 Col B"], "columns_field_name": ["line_1_col_a", "line_15_col_a", "line_14_col_a", "line_6_col_b", "line_22c_col_a", "schedulei_line_3", "line_7_col_a", "sync_flag", "line_1_col_b", "line_12_col_a", "line_21_col_a", "scheduleb1_line_3", "schedulea_line_1", "line_21_col_b", "line_5_col_b", "line_7_col_b", "filer_name", "filing_date", "line_17_col_a", "start_date", "line_3_col_b", "line_3_col_a", "line_2_col_b", "fppc_id", "filer_nid", "schedulei_line_2", "schedulee_line_1", "scheduled_line_1", "schedulec_line_2", "filing_nid", "line_18_col_a", "line_22a_col_a", "schedulea_line_3", "filing_activity_nid", "data_as_of", "data_loaded_at", "filing_type", "schedulef_line_1", "schedulee_line_4", "line_11_col_a", "line_8_col_a", "line_22b_col_a", "form_type", "scheduleh_line_2", "line_20_col_b", "scheduled_line_3", "scheduleb1_line_2", "scheduleb1_line_1", "line_2_col_a", "line_4_col_a", "line_5_col_a", "line_20_col_a", "line_19_col_a", "schedulee_line_3", "schedulee_line_2", "filer_type", "schedulec_line_1", "line_10_col_b", "line_10_col_a", "line_9_col_b", "line_9_col_a", "line_8_col_b", "schedulec_line_3", "scheduled_line_2", "schedulef_line_2", "line_6_col_a", "schedulei_line_1", "filing_id_number", "end_date", "line_4_col_b", "line_13_col_a", "line_16_col_a", "schedulef_line_3", "scheduleh_line_1", "scheduleh_line_3", "schedulei_line_4", "schedulea_line_2", "line_11_col_b"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Checkbox", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Form 460 - Monetary Contributions This Period;

This study has been conducted periodically by CC&G since 2013.\n\nPrimary goals of this study include:\n\n\u2022 Estimate mode share for trips into, within, and out of San Francisco, focusing on the percentage of trips made by walking, biking, and public transit compared to other modes (e.g. driving, TNC, etc.). This survey is the primary instrument for tracking the SFMTA Strategic Plan metric \u201ctransportation mode share\u201d and provides information used by the agency across divisions.\n\u2022 Evaluation of the above statement based on the number of trips to, from, and within San Francisco by Bay Area residents. Note that trips by visitors from outside the Bay Area, and for commercial purposes whether originating in the Bay Area or not, are not included.\n\u2022 Provide additional trip details, including trip purpose for each trip in the mode share question series.\n\u2022 Collect demographic data on the population of Bay Area residents who travel to, from, and within San Francisco.\n\nThe survey was conducted as a telephone study among 756 Bay Area residents aged 18 and older. Telephone surveying was conducted during May \u2013 September 2021. Interviewing was conducted in English, Spanish, and Chinese. Surveying was conducted via random digit dial (RDD) and cell phone sample.\n\nTo enhance statistical accuracy, data was weighted by age and location. Not all totals will add to 100% due to rounding. In portions of this report, a dash (-) is used to indicate no respondents answered with the response code listed. The margin of error at the 95% confidence level is +/-3.56% for the total sample (n = 756). For other sample sizes, the margin of error is as follows:\n\n\u2022 San Francisco residents; n = 470.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset contains the current San Francisco Board of Supervisor district boundaries approved by the <u><a href=\"https://sf.gov/public-body/2020-census-redistricting-task-force#:~:text=The%20Redistricting%20Task%20Force%20consists,following%20each%20federal%20decennial%20census.\">San Francisco Redistricting Task Force</a></u>. This dataset was created in April 2022 following redistricting based on the 2020 Decennial Census. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis dataset will be updated to reflect the most current Supervisor District boundaries available. It currently reflects the same boundaries found in <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/f2zs-jevy\">Supervisor Districts (2022)</a></u>. More information on how this was created can be found in the datasets by year: <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/f2zs-jevy\">Supervisor Districts (2022)</a></u> and <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/keex-zmn4\">Supervisor Districts (2012)</a></u>\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nSupervisor District boundaries are updated every 10 years following the federal Decennial Census. The Supervisor District boundaries reflected in this dataset will be manually updated after the next Decennial Census in 2030.\n\nThe dataset is also manually updated as new members of the Board of Supervisors are elected or appointed. The most recent manual update date is reflected in the 'data_as_of' field. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset can be joined to other datasets for analysis and reporting at the Supervisor District level. \n\nIf you are building an automated reporting pipeline using Socrata API access, we recommend using this dataset if you would like the boundaries to automatically update after each decennial census to reflect the most recent Supervisor District boundaries. If you'd like your boundaries to remain static, see the <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/f2zs-jevy\">Supervisor Districts (2022)</a></u> dataset. \n\n<strong>E.

{"resource": {"name": "Supplier Contracts", "id": "cqi5-hm2d", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "The San Francisco Controller's Office maintains a database of contracts and payments made to Suppliers (vendors, contractors and grantees). The Supplier Contracts shown here include all fully executed, expenditure-only contracts, including City contracts for commodities, professional and general services, and construction from fiscal year 2018 forward, based upon the contracting departments' inputs. This data set includes both departmental and citywide contracts.\n\nThis data is presented on the Supplier Contracts report hosted at http://openbook.sfgov.org, and is also available in CSV format, which lists summary data by contract. We have removed sensitive contracts and information from this data in order to balance disclosure requirements and protected/confidential data. For example, we have removed contracts related to certain legal proceedings that are exempt from disclosure.  New data is added on a weekly basis.\n\n\nRevenue contracts, including concessions and rental income contracts, are not included in this data set; they are tracked in departmental subsystems and currently are not available in SF Open Book. For more information about Revenue Contracts, please contact the respective City Department that awards the contract, e.g. for Airport Concession Contracts, contact the San Francisco Airport Commission which maintains these records.\n\nCity Department spending may occur three ways: 1) from Contract to Purchase Order (i.e. a PO with an accounting Encumbrance) to Payment (i.e. an accounting Voucher), AKA On-Contract spending, 2) direct-to-Purchase Order (no contract, only a PO agreement and accounting Encumbrance) to Payment, and 3) Direct Voucher Payment (for limited one-time, non-recurring payments, e.g. a membership or a subscription).  Therefore, it is helpful to use both the Supplier Contracts and Supplier Payments reports on SFOpenBook, as well as on DataSF.\n\nThe data included in the Supplier Contracts dataset reflects supplier expenditure contracts that were awarded by City Departments after 7/1/2017, the date the City & County of San Francisco implemented the PeopleSoft Financial & Procurement System, as well as the remaining not-to-exceed contract authority for all supplier expenditure contracts that were still active along with their associated purchase order (PO) available, unexpended balances as of 7/1/2017. For partially used contract authority, the Contract Award Amount only includes the portion that was unutilized and available as of 7/1/2017, unless the Contract Award Amount was updated by the department after July 1, 2017. Contracts that were expired before 7/1/2017 as well as contracts that had no remaining contracting authority from which to issue new purchase orders were not converted or loaded into PeopleSoft. For information requests regarding the latter as well as for the portion of contract of authority used prior to 7/1/2017 for otherwise unexpired contract balances that were converted and still active as of 7/1/2017, please contact the City department(s) that issued the contract.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-09-11T12:36:58.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-02-20T21:32:27.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-09-11T12:36:43.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-09-11T12:36:58.000Z", "columns_name": ["Contract Title", "Supplier Type", "Supplier Name (Prime Contractor)", "Remaining Contract Award Amount", "Scope of Work", "Purchasing Authority", "Contract Type", "Non-Profit", "project_team_lbe_status", "Purchase Orders Outstanding", "Payments Made", "Contract Awarded Amount", "Supplier Name", "Department Code", "Sole Source", "Term End Date", "Contract Number", "Department", "Term Start Date"], "columns_field_name": ["contract_title", "project_team_constituent", "prime_contractor", "remaining_amt", "scope_of_work", "purchasing_authority", "contract_type", "non_profit", "project_team_lbe_status", "consumed_amt", "pmt_amt", "agreed_amt", "project_team_supplier", "department_code", "sole_source_flg", "term_end_date", "contract_no", "department", "term_start_date"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date"], "columns_description": ["The general description of goods or services provided", "The type of supplier (prime contractor, subcontractor, or jont venture constituent) performing work on the contract", "The name of the prime contractor responsible for the contract", "The remaining award amount on the contract", "The type of good or service provided by the project team member", "The City legal or statutory authority permitting the contract", "The type of contract", "Indicates whether the supplier has been certified as a non-profit entity", "", "The balance of outstanding purchase orders released against the contract", "The sum of payments from the City to the prime contractor, or from the prime contractor to a subcontractor", "The portion of the contract award allocated to the project team member", "The name of the prime contractor, subcontractor, or jont venture constituent performing work on the contract", "The three-digit code of the City department entering into the contract", "Indicates whether the purchasing authority of the contract permits sole source purchases", "The expiration date of the contract term", "A unique number assigned to the contract", "The name of the City department entering into the contract", "The start date of the contract term"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "currency", "currencyStyle": "USD", "precision": "2"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "currency", "precision": "2", "align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "currency", "precision": "2", "align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "currency", "precision": "2", "align": "left"}, {}, {}, {}, {"view": "date_ymd"}, {}, {}, {"view": "date_ymd"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-04-20T10:02:03.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["environment"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "City Management and Ethics", "domain_tags": ["award", "contract", "prime contractor", "procurement", "project team", "purchasing", "subcontractor", "supplier", "vendor"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Department-Metrics_Publishing-Department", "value": "Controller"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Publishing-frequency", "value": "Weekly"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Data-change-frequency", "value": "Daily"}, {"key": "Detailed-Descriptive_Geographic-unit", "value": "Not applicable"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.sfgov.org", "license": "Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License"}, "permalink": "https://data.sfgov.org/d/cqi5-hm2d", "link": "https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Supplier-Contracts/cqi5-hm2d", "owner": {"id": "9ufn-6bwh", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Alex Levitsky"}, "creator": {"id": "9ufn-6bwh", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Alex Levitsky"}}

SUMMARY</strong>\n\n<strong><i>Please note that the \"Data Last Updated\" date on this page denotes the most recent DataSF update and does not reflect the most recent update to this dataset. To confirm the completeness of this dataset please contact the District Attorney's office at <u><a href=\u201dmailto:districtattorney@sfgov.org\u201d>districtattorney@sfgov.org</a></u>.</strong></i>\n\nThis dataset includes information on every arrest that has been presented to the SFDA since 2011 and the \u201caction\u201d decision made by the office on each, based on data from the SFDA\u2019s internal case management system.\n\nAfter law enforcement has made an arrest for suspected criminal activity, the arresting agency presents its evidence to the District Attorney\u2019s Office to determine what, if any, charges can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. This prosecutorial decision to file or to reject arrest charges represents the first, and one of the most important, decisions of the District Attorney\u2019s Office. In addition to either filing new charges or declining to file charges (\u201cdischarging\u201d the arrest), the prosecutor may also take other actions, such as initiating a motion to revoke probation or parole, referring the case back to the arresting agency for further investigation, or referring the case to another criminal justice agency.\n\nMore information about this dataset can be found under the \u201cDistrict Attorney Actions on Arrests Presented\u201d section on the <u><a href=\"https://sfdistrictattorney.org/policy/data-dashboards/#sfda-actions-on-arrests-presented\">Data Dashboards page</a></u>\n\n<strong><i>Disclaimer: The San Francisco District Attorney's Office does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information as the data is subject to change as modifications and updates are completed.</strong></i>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\n\nWhen an arrest is presented to the District Attorney\u2019s office, relevant data is manually entered into the District Attorney Office's case management system. Data reports are pulled from this system on a semi-regular basis, cleaned, anonymized, and added to Open Data.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\n\nWe strive to update this dataset at the beginning of every week.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Cases by Geography Over Time", "id": "d2ef-idww", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset contains COVID-19 positive confirmed cases aggregated by several different geographic areas and by day. COVID-19 cases are mapped to the residence of the individual and shown on the date the positive test was collected. In addition, 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) population estimates are included to calculate the cumulative rate per 10,000 residents.\n\nDataset covers cases going back to 3/2/2020 when testing began. This data may not be immediately available for recently reported cases and data will change to reflect as information becomes available. Data updated daily.\n\nGeographic areas summarized are:\n1. <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Analysis-Neighborhoods/p5b7-5n3h\">Analysis Neighborhoods</a>\n2. <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Census-2010-Tracts-for-San-Francisco/rarb-5ahf\">Census Tracts</a>\n3. <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html\">Census Zip Code Tabulation Areas</a>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nAddresses from the COVID-19 case data are geocoded by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). Those addresses are spatially joined to the geographic areas. Counts are generated based on the number of address points that match each geographic area for a given date.\n\nThe 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) population estimates provided by the Census are used to create a cumulative rate which is equal to <i>([cumulative count up to that date] / [acs_population]) * 10000)</i> representing the number of total cases per 10,000 residents (as of the specified date).\n\nCOVID-19 case data undergo quality assurance and other data verification processes and are continually updated to maximize completeness and accuracy of information. This means data may change for previous days as information is updated.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nGeographic analysis is scripted by SFDPH staff and synced to this dataset daily at 05:00 Pacific Time.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nSan Francisco population estimates for geographic regions can be found in a <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/35v5-seg9\">view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset</a>. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS).\n\nThis dataset can be used to track the spread of COVID-19 throughout the city, in a variety of geographic areas. Note that the new cases column in the data represents the number of new cases confirmed in a certain area on the specified day, while the cumulative cases column is the cumulative total of cases in a certain area as of the specified date.\n\n<em>Privacy rules in effect</em>\nTo protect privacy, certain rules are in effect:\n1. Any area with a cumulative case count less than 10 are dropped for all days the cumulative count was less than 10. These will be null values.\n2. Once an area has a cumulative case count of 10 or greater, that area will have a new row of case data every day following.\n3. Cases are dropped altogether for areas where acs_population < 1000\n4. Deaths data are not included in this dataset for privacy reasons. The low COVID-19 death rate in San Francisco, along with other publicly available information on deaths, means that deaths data by geography and day is too granular and potentially risky. Read more in our <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-19-Data-Tracker-Publishing-Privacy-Guideline/9aj4-um47\">privacy guidelines</a>\n\n<em>Rate suppression in effect where counts lower than 20</em>\nRates are not calculated unless the cumulative case count is greater than or equal to 20. Rates are generally unstable at small numbers, so we avoid calculating them directly. We advise you to apply the same approach as this is best practice in epidemiology.\n\n<em>A note on Census ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)</em>\nZIP Code Tabulation Areas are spec", "attribution": "Department of Public Health - Population Health Division", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-09-17T13:10:00.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-07-17T18:49:47.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-09-17T13:09:34.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-09-17T13:10:00.000Z", "columns_name": ["data_loaded_at", "rate_of_cumulative_confirmed_cases", "cumulative_confirmed_cases", "acs_population", "id", "specimen_collection_date", "new_confirmed_cases", "area_type", "data_as_of"], "columns_field_name": ["data_loaded_at", "rate_of_cumulative_confirmed_cases", "cumulative_confirmed_cases", "acs_population", "id", "specimen_collection_date", "new_confirmed_cases", "area_type", "data_as_of"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "Text", "Calendar date"], "columns_description": ["Timestamp when data entered the Socrata system", "The rate of cases in the area, calculated as (count/acs_population) * 10000 which is a rate per 10,000 residents", "The cumulative total cases in the area as of the specified date", "The population from the latest 5-year estimates from the American Community Survey (2015-2019)", "The identifier for the area type", "Date the positive test was collected for the confirmed cases ", "The count of new cases in the area on the specified date", "Type of geographic area, one of: Citywide, Census Tract, Analysis Neighborhood, or ZCTA (ZIP Code Tabulation Area)", "Timestamp for last update date in source system"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"view": "date_ymd"}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2023-01-31T19:16:06.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "health", "public safety"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "COVID-19", "domain_tags": ["cases", "census tract", "covid", "covid-19", "mapping", "maps", "neighborhoods", "zip", "zip code"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Department-Metrics_Publishing-Department", "value": "Public Health"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Publishing-frequency", "value": "Daily"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Data-change-frequency", "value": "Daily"}, {"key": "Detailed-Descriptive_Geographic-unit", "value": "Other"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.sfgov.org", "license": "Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License"}, "permalink": "https://data.sfgov.org/d/d2ef-idww", "link": "https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-19-Cases-by-Geography-Over-Time/d2ef-idww", "owner": {"id": "dbag-6qd9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "OpenData"}, "creator": {"id": "dbag-6qd9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "OpenData"}}

SUMMARY</strong>\n\n<strong><i>Please note that the \"Data Last Updated\" date on this page denotes the most recent DataSF update and does not reflect the most recent update to this dataset. To confirm the completeness of this dataset please contact the District Attorney's office at <u><a href=\u201dmailto:districtattorney@sfgov.org\u201d>districtattorney@sfgov.org</a></u>.</strong></i>\n\nThis dataset includes information on all cases presented to the District Attorney\u2019s Office in which the office has taken action to prosecute a case, either by filing new criminal charges or by filing a motion to revoke probation or parole (MTR). This does not include cases in which the San Francisco Adult Probation Department or the state Division of Adult Parole Operations files a motion to revoke.\n\nFor cases in which SFDA files a new criminal charge, the most serious offense type is categorized as the most serious offense for which SFDA prosecuted the defendant. For cases in which SFDA files an MTR, the most serious offense is categorized as the most serious offense for which the person was initially prosecuted. This is because a filing of an MTR means that new criminal charges were not filed for the new arresting offense, but rather that the District Attorney\u2019s Office is seeking a new sanction as part of the sentence of a prior criminal conviction. For MTRs, the filing date is based on the date when SFDA filed the MTR for the new arrest.\n\nMore information about this dataset can be found under the \u201cCases Prosecuted\u201d section on the <u><a href=\"https://sfdistrictattorney.org/policy/data-dashboards/#cases-prosecuted\">Data Dashboards page</a></u>\n\n<strong><i>Disclaimer: The San Francisco District Attorney's Office does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information as the data is subject to change as modifications and updates are completed.</strong></i>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\n\nWhen District Attorney\u2019s Office takes action to prosecute a case, relevant data is manually entered into the District Attorney Office's case management system. Data reports are pulled from this system on a semi-regular basis, cleaned, anonymized, and added to Open Data.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\n\nWe strive to update this dataset at the beginning of every week. However, the creation of this dataset requires a manual pull from the Office's case management system and is dependent on staff availability.\n\n<strong>D.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Vaccinations Given to SF Residents by Geography", "id": "ejrc-vnwu", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong> \nThis dataset represents the COVID-19 vaccinations given to residents of San Francisco summarized by the geographic region of their residential address. All vaccines given to SF residents are included, no matter where the vaccination took place (the vaccine may have been administered in San Francisco or outside of San Francisco).  \n\nData provides counts for residents who have received at least one dose, residents who have completed a primary vaccine series, residents who have received one or two monovalent (not bivalent) booster doses, and residents who have received a bivalent booster dose. A primary vaccine series is complete after an individual has received all intended doses of the initial series. There are one, two, and three dose primary vaccine series. \n \n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong> \nInformation on doses administered to those who live in San Francisco is from the <a href=\"https://cdph.ca.gov/CAIR\">California Immunization Registry (CAIR2)</a>, run by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The information on individuals\u2019 residential addresses is recorded in CAIR and are self-reported at the time of vaccine administration. San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) then runs additional processes to spatially match each address to a geographical region. \n\nIn order to estimate the percent of San Francisco residents vaccinated, we provide the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) population estimates for each analysis neighborhood.\n \n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> \nUpdated daily via automated process \n \n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong> \nSan Francisco population estimates for geographic regions can be found in a <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/35v5-seg9\">view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset</a>. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS). \n\nThis data is grouped by SF residents\u2019 analysis neighborhoods of residence. To query counts of individuals vaccinated by analysis neighborhood, filter to \"area_type\" = \u2018Analysis Neighborhood\u2019, and \"id\" will contain the analysis neighborhood name. To query summarized counts of all vaccinated individuals in San Francisco and whether the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) was able to match their residential address to a location, filter to \"area_type\" = \u2018Summary\u2019. \n\nTo count the number of individuals vaccinated (with any primary series dose), use the \"count_vaccinated\" column. To count the number of individuals vaccinated (with any primary series dose) by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH), use the \"count_vaccinated_by_dph\" column.  To count the number of individuals who have completed their primary vaccine series, use the \"count_series_completed\" column. To count the number of individuals who received one or two monovalent (not bivalent) boosters, use the \"count_received_booster\" and \"count_received_2nd_booster\" columns. To count the number of individuals who received at least one bivalent booster, use the \"count_received_bivalent_booster\" columns. \n\n<strong>E.

For historical purposes, you can access the archived dataset at the following link:  \n\n<a href= \"https://data.sfgov.org/d/4e7h-hjt4\">ARCHIVED: COVID-19 Vaccines Given to San Franciscans by Geography</a>\n\n<strong>F.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset contains San Francisco Board of Supervisor district boundaries approved by the <u><a href=\"https://sf.gov/public-body/2020-census-redistricting-task-force#:~:text=The%20Redistricting%20Task%20Force%20consists,following%20each%20federal%20decennial%20census.\">San Francisco Redistricting Task Force</a></u> in April 2022 following redistricting based on the 2020 Decennial Census. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe dataset was created from the <u><a href=\"https://sfgov.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=57159538a9a3422a9d22ef75d66565b6\">final map</a></u> submitted by the San Francisco Redistricting Task Force. Boundaries in this map were decided using data from the 2020 Census on the number of people living in each census block in the City and County. This data includes the number of individuals incarcerated in facilities under the control of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation based on their last known residential address. This information is made available by the <u><a href=\"https://statewidedatabase.org/\">Statewide Database</a></u> based on U.S. Census Bureau Census Redistricting Data (P.L. 94-171).\n\nThese map boundaries were trimmed to align with the city and county's physical boundaries for greater usability. This trimming mainly consisted of excluding the water around the City and County from the boundaries.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nSupervisor District boundaries are updated every 10 years following the federal Decennial Census. The Supervisor Districts reflected in this dataset will remain unchanged until after the next Decennial Census in 2030. A new dataset will be created after the next Decennial Census and redistricting process are completed. \n\nThe dataset is manually updated as new members of the Board of Supervisors are elected or appointed. The most recent manual update date is reflected in the 'data_as_of' field. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset can be joined to other datasets for analysis and reporting at the Supervisor District level. \n\n<strong>E.

SUMMARY </strong>\nThis dataset represents doses of mpox vaccine (JYNNEOS) administered in California to residents of San Francisco ages 18 years or older. This dataset only includes doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine given on or after 5/1/2022. All vaccines given to people who live in San Francisco are included, no matter where the vaccination took place. The data are broken down by multiple demographic stratifications.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED </strong>\nInformation on doses administered to those who live in San Francisco is from the <a href=\"https://cdph.ca.gov/CAIR\">California Immunization Registry (CAIR2)</a>, run by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). Information on individuals\u2019 city of residence, age, race, ethnicity, and sex are recorded in CAIR2 and are self-reported at the time of vaccine administration. Because CAIR2 does not include information on sexual orientation, we pull information from the San Francisco Department of Public Health\u2019s  Epic Electronic Health Record (EHR). The populations represented in our Epic data and the CAIR2 data are different. Epic data only include vaccinations administered at SFDPH managed sites to SF residents.  \n\nData notes for population characteristic types are listed below. \n\n<u>Age </u>\n* Data only include individuals who are 18 years of age or older. \n \n<u>Race/ethnicity </u>\n* The response option \"Other Race\" is categorized by the data source system, and the response option \"Unknown\" refers to a lack of data. \n \n<u>Sex </u>\n* The response option \"Other\" is categorized by the source system, and the response option \"Unknown\" refers to a lack of data. \n\n<u>Sexual orientation </u>\n* The response option \u201cUnknown/Declined\u201d refers to a lack of data or individuals who reported multiple different sexual orientations during their most recent interaction with SFDPH. \n\nFor convenience, we provide <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/4qbq-hvtt\"> the 2020 5-year American Community Survey population estimates</a>.\n\n<strong>C.

{"resource": {"name": "On-street Carshare Parking", "id": "g2t6-cyw6", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "A. SUMMARY This dataset was first created as part of the SFMTA On Street Car Share Pilot Program (approved by the MTA Board in July 2013) to illustrate the location of implemented and planned (various stages) spaces throughout the city.\n\nB. METHODOLOGY  The locations were originally provided to the MTA as requests by the three car share organizations (CSOs). These were given as a .kml file, which was converted to a .shp. Additional fields were created using spatial joins (zipcode, supervisor district, CNN, etc). Use definition query tool to display those locations with a certain attribute. For example, query Existing = 1 to display those locations that are on street operating. 500 submissions were given by CSOs to the MTA, but only a portion of those were brought to the MTA Board for approval, and even fewer were implemented as operational on street spaces. With no definition query, you can see all spaces as features, with varying levels of data completion. \n\nC. UPDATE FREQUENCY  During periods of implementation/construction, updates were as frequent as daily or weekly. However, as the frequency of newly implemented spaces slowed over the course of the pilot, updates occurred less frequently--weekly or monthly. Updates will be needed as new spaces are implemented--many of the spaces not taken past MTA Board approval have incomplete data.  \n\nD. OTHER CRITICAL INFO  Each feature (or each row, or point) represents a single car share parking space. Some parking spaces belong to a \"pod\" where there are two adjacent car share parking spaces, indicated by the \"PodType\" field. To summarize or analyze by pod, use the \"POD\" field.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-09-11T17:01:15.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-04-24T21:36:20.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-09-11T17:01:13.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-09-11T17:01:15.000Z", "columns_name": ["DATESUBMIT", "SPACEID", "ST_NAME", "ST_TYPE", "ADDRANGE", "WO_ROUND", "WO_STATUS", "INFO", "POD", "SPACE_TYPE", "CSO", "DATEMODIFY", "CONFLICT", "FLAG_NOTE", "POINT_X", "POINT_Y", "PH_DATE", "TASC_DATE", "APPROVAL", "WO_COMPLET", "INTRSXN", "PODTYPE", "ZIPCODE", "NHOOD", "PRICEZONE", "SUPNAME", "SUPDSTRICT", "STATUS", "CSO_NUM", "GLOBALID", "EXISTING", "OBJECTID", "STREETNAME", "POST_ID", "MTAB_DATE", "WO_LOG_NO", "OPER_DATE", "ADDRESS", "CNN_SEG", "CNN_INTXN", "shape"], "columns_field_name": ["datesubmit", "spaceid", "st_name", "st_type", "addrange", "wo_round", "wo_status", "info", "pod", "space_type", "cso", "datemodify", "conflict", "flag_note", "point_x", "point_y", "ph_date", "tasc_date", "approval", "wo_complet", "intrsxn", "podtype", "zipcode", "nhood", "pricezone", "supname", "supdstrict", "status", "cso_num", "globalid", "existing", "objectid", "streetname", "post_id", "mtab_date", "wo_log_no", "oper_date", "address", "cnn_seg", "cnn_intxn", "shape"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Date of space request submission", "Unique identifier for the on-street car sharing space (refers to the CSO and location of the space request, where City CarShare begins with C; Getaround with G; Zipcar with Z.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Vaccinations Given to SF Residents by Demographics", "id": "g8hh-rwgb", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong> \nThis dataset represents the COVID-19 vaccinations given to residents of San Francisco. All vaccines given to SF residents are included, no matter where the vaccination took place (the vaccine may have been administered in San Francisco or outside of San Francisco). The data are broken down by multiple demographic stratifications. This dataset also includes COVID-19 vaccinations given to SF residents by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). \n\nData provides counts for residents who have received at least one dose, residents who have completed a primary vaccine series, residents who have received one or two monovalent (not bivalent) booster doses, and residents who have received a bivalent booster dose. A primary vaccine series is complete after an individual has received all intended doses of the initial series. There are one, two, and three dose primary vaccine series. \n \n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong> \nInformation on doses administered to those who live in San Francisco is from the <a href=\"https://cdph.ca.gov/CAIR\">California Immunization Registry (CAIR2)</a>, run by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The information on individuals\u2019 city of residence, age, race, and ethnicity are also recorded in CAIR and are self-reported at the time of vaccine administration. \n\nIn order to estimate the percent of San Franciscans vaccinated, we provide the 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) population estimates for each demographic group.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> \nUpdated daily via automated process \n \n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong> \nSan Francisco population estimates for race/ethnicity and age groups can be found in a <a href=\" https://data.sfgov.org/d/cedd-86uf\">view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset</a>. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS). \n\nBefore analysis, you must filter the dataset to the desired stratification of data using the \"overall_segment\" column. \n \nFor example, filtering \"overall_segment\" to \"All SF Residents by Age Bracket, Administered by All Providers\" will filter the data to residents whose vaccinations were administered by any provider. You can then further segment the data and calculate percentages by Age Brackets. \n \nIf you filter \"overall_segment\" to \"All SF Residents by Race/Ethnicity, Administered by DPH Only\", you will see the race/ethnicity breakdown for residents who received vaccinations from the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). \n\nIf you filter \"overall_segment\" to \"All SF Residents by Age Group, Administered by All Providers\" you will see vaccination counts of various age eligibility groups that were administered by any provider. \n\nTo count the number of individuals vaccinated (with any primary series dose), use the \"total_recipients\" column. To count the number of individuals who have completed their primary vaccine series, use the \"total_series_completed\" column. To count the number of primary series doses administered (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or single doses), use the \"total_primary_series_doses\" column. \n \nTo count the number of individuals who received one or two monovalent (not bivalent) booster doses, use the \"total_booster_recipients\" and \"total_2nd_booster_recipients\" columns. To count the number of individuals who received their first bivalent booster dose, use the \"total_bivalent_booster_recipients\" column. To count the number of monovalent (not including bivalent) or bivalent booster doses administered, use the \"total_booster_doses\" or \"total_bivalent_booster_doses\" columns.  \n\n<strong>E.

For historical purposes, you can access the archived dataset at the following link:  \n\n<a href= \"https://data.sfgov.org/d/wv2h-rqwk\">ARCHIVED: COVID-19 Vaccine Doses Given to San Franciscans by Demographics</a>\n\n<strong>F.

SUMMARY</strong>\nLaw Enforcement Dispatched Calls for Service \u2013 Real-time dataset includes all calls for service  which generate a record in the Department of Emergency Management's Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System, and typically have a law enforcement unit dispatched to the location. Calls originate from the public via calls to the 911 call center or from law enforcement officers in the field upon viewing an incident (\u2018On-View\u2019).  \n \nThe Real-time dataset is delayed by 10 minutes, and represents a rolling 48 hour window of calls for service.  It contains both open and closed calls and is updated every 10 minutes.  It is delayed by 10 minutes. Open calls are active calls that are unverified, but being worked by law enforcement. Closed calls are calls that law enforcement have indicated are resolved.  Not all Calls for Service generate a Police Incident Report, so data does not directly correlate to the Police Incidents Report dataset. The dataset contains calls handled by law enforcement which can include Police, MTA parking enforcement, the Sheriff\u2019s Office, and others. All relevant time intervals are also included. Some Calls for Service data is suppressed, due to the nature of the call and privacy concerns related to the incident. \n\nPlease refer <u><a href=\"https://datasf.gitbook.io/datasf-dataset-explainers/law-enforcement-dispatched-calls-for-service\">Law Enforcement Dispatched Calls for Service Explainer</a></u> for full documentation \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>  \nOnce a received 911 call is dispatched, a record (CAD#) is generated in the Department of Emergency Management's Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System.   \n\n<strong>C.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset represents San Francisco COVID-19 positive confirmed cases by vaccination status over time, starting January 1, 2021. Cases are included on the date the positive test was collected (the specimen collection date). Cases are counted in three categories: (1) all cases; (2) unvaccinated cases; and (3) completed primary series cases.\n\n1.\tAll cases: Includes cases among all San Francisco residents regardless of vaccination status.\n\n2.\tUnvaccinated cases: Cases are considered unvaccinated if their positive COVID-19 test was before receiving any vaccine. Cases that are not matched to a COVID-19 vaccination record are considered unvaccinated.\n\n3.\tCompleted primary series cases: Cases are considered completed primary series if their positive COVID-19 test was 14 days or more after they received their 2nd dose in a 2-dose COVID-19 series or the single dose of a 1-dose vaccine. These are also called \u201cbreakthrough cases.\u201d \n\nOn September 12, 2021, a new case definition of COVID-19 was introduced that includes criteria for enumerating new infections after previous probable or confirmed infections (also known as reinfections). A reinfection is defined as a confirmed positive PCR lab test more than 90 days after a positive PCR or antigen test. The first reinfection case was identified on December 7, 2021. \n\nData is lagged by eight days, meaning the most recent specimen collection date included is eight days prior to today. All data updates daily as more information becomes available.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCase information is based on confirmed positive laboratory tests reported to the City. The City then completes quality assurance and other data verification processes.   Vaccination data comes from the California Immunization Registry (CAIR2). The California Department of Public Health runs CAIR2. Individual-level case and vaccination data are matched to identify cases by vaccination status in this dataset. Case records are matched to vaccine records using first name, last name, date of birth, phone number, and email address.    \n\nWe include vaccination records from all nine Bay Area counties in order to improve matching rates. This allows us to identify breakthrough cases among people who moved to the City from other Bay Area counties after completing their vaccine series. Only cases among San Francisco residents are included. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 08:00 AM Pacific Time each day. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nTotal San Francisco population estimates can be found in a <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/cedd-86uf\">view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset</a>. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS). To identify total San Francisco population estimates, filter the view on \u201cdemographic_category_label\u201d = \u201call ages\u201d. \n\nPopulation estimates by vaccination status are derived from our publicly reported vaccination counts, which can be found at <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/rutu-rpar\"> COVID-19 Vaccinations Given to SF Residents Over Time</a>. \n\nThe dataset includes new cases, 7-day average new cases, new case rates, 7-day average new case rates, percent of total cases, and 7-day average percent of total cases for each vaccination category. \n\nNew cases are the count of cases where the positive tests were collected on that specific specimen collection date. The 7-day rolling average shows the trend in new cases. The rolling average is calculated by averaging the new cases for a particular day with the prior 6 days.\n\nNew case rates are the count of new cases per 100,000 residents in each vaccination status group.

{"resource": {"name": "Current Supervisor Districts (trimmed to remove water and other non-populated City territories)", "id": "hcgx-vtsb", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset contains a version of the current San Francisco Board of Supervisor district boundaries that have been trimmed to exclude non-populated City and County territory that is outside of the contiguous land mass of the City and County. This excludes for example City and County land in the Farallon Islands, Angel Island, and Alameda County,\n\nThe underlying official current Supervisor District boundaries are available in the <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Current-Supervisor-Districts/cqbw-m5m3\">Current Supervisor Districts</a></u> dataset.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis dataset will be updated to reflect the most current Supervisor District boundaries available. It currently reflects the same boundaries found in <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/f2zs-jevy\">Supervisor Districts (2022)</a></u>. More information on how this was created can be found in the datasets by year: <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/f2zs-jevy\">Supervisor Districts (2022)</a></u> and <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/keex-zmn4\">Supervisor Districts (2012)</a></u>\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nSupervisor District boundaries are updated every 10 years following the federal Decennial Census. The Supervisor District boundaries reflected in this dataset will be manually updated after the next Decennial Census in 2030.\n\nThe dataset is also manually updated as new members of the Board of Supervisors are elected or appointed. The most recent manual update date is reflected in the 'data_as_of' field. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset can be joined to other datasets for analysis and reporting at the Supervisor District level.

For more information please see http://sf-planning.org/pipeline-report\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe dataset is created by combining projects data from the City Planning Department and permit data from the Building Inspection Department to create a quarterly snapshot that shows when a project is filed to construction.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe Development Pipeline is updated as a quarterly snapshot of the construction development in the City of San Francisco.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nEach row or record is a project or permit. They are fitted with information such as address, block lot, project case number and spatial data that allow users to find the specific project. Each row also contains project specific information such as project description and details to illustrate the scope of the project.\n\n<strong>E. DATA NOTES </strong>\n\n<strong>Reporting Update</strong>\nSignificant data and systems improvements are underway to produce a more accurate quarterly pipeline, so the data may change at any time. Weekly and monthly data on Planning Applications and Building Permits can be accessed via the City's Open Data Portal.\n\n<strong>Change in Status Definitions</strong>\nThe following changes have been made in status definitions since the 2022 Q1 Pipeline Report to align the Quarterly Pipeline Reports with other Housing Reports (Housing Inventory and Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) Annual Progress)  <br>\n<strong> (1) Construction: </strong> projects that are authorized for construction deemed to be in the construction stage.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThese data represent hate crimes reported by the SFPD to the California Department of Justice. <u><a href=\"https://datasf.gitbook.io/datasf-dataset-explainers/police-department-hate-crimes-data\">Read the detailed overview of this dataset here.</a></u>\n\nWhat is a Hate Crime? \nA hate crime is a crime against a person, group, or property motivated by the victim's real or perceived protected social group. An individual may be the victim of a hate crime if they have been targeted because of their actual or perceived: (1) disability, (2) gender, (3) nationality, (4) race or ethnicity, (5) religion, (6) sexual orientation, and/or (7) association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics. Hate crimes are serious crimes that may result in imprisonment or jail time.  \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nHow is a Hate Crime Processed?  \nNot all prejudice incidents including the utterance of hate speech rise to the level of a hate crime.  The U.S. Constitution allows hate speech if it does not interfere with the civil rights of others. While these acts are certainly hurtful, they do not rise to the level of criminal violations and thus may not be prosecuted. When a prejudice incident is reported, the reporting officer conducts a preliminary investigation and writes a crime or incident report. Bigotry must be the central motivation for an incident to be determined to be a hate crime. In that report, all facts such as verbatims or statements that occurred before or after the incident and characteristics such as the race, ethnicity, sex, religion, or sexual orientations of the victim and suspect (if known) are included. To classify a prejudice incident, the San Francisco Police Department\u2019s Hate Crimes Unit of the Special Investigations Division conducts an analysis of the incident report to determine if the incident falls under the definition of a \u201chate crime\u201d as defined by state law. \n<u><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=422.55.\">California Penal Code 422.55 - Hate Crime Definition</a></u>\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThese data are updated monthly. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset includes the following information about each incident: the hate crime offense, bias type, location/time, and the number of hate crime victims and suspects. The data presented mirrors data published by the California Department of Justice, albeit at a higher frequency. The publishing of these data meet requirements set forth in PC 13023.\n\n<strong>E.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThe dataset includes details of all building permit applications filed with the Department of Building Inspection. Permit numbers and associated information may be repeated in multiple rows if there are multiple addresses associated with the permit. To view the deduplicated building permits dataset with just the primary address, <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Housing-and-Buildings/Building-Permits-Deduplicated-on-Primary-Address/f2jc-ivnc\">click here</a></u>. Data is uploaded nightly by DBI. Users can view associated addenda, routing, and inspection information for each permit in the dataset online through DBI\u2019s Permit Tracking System <u><a href=\"https://dbiweb02.sfgov.org/dbipts/\">here</a></u>.\n\n<b> A full data dictionary for this dataset is available by <u><a href=\"https://datasf.gitbook.io/datasf-dataset-explainers/dbi-building-permits-and-permit-addenda-data/building-permits-data-dictionary\">clicking here.</a></u> </b>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe dataset is created by extracting permit characteristics and key dates (including permit filing, issuance, and completion dates) from DBI\u2019s Permit Tracking System.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe process that builds this dataset will run nightly and include all permits entered into the system up to the time of the refresh (see the \u201cdata as of\u201d column in the dataset).\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nUsers can use this dataset to search for all permits associated with a specific address or parcel number and view characteristics like addresses, permit descriptions of work, unit counts, valuations, etc. If the analytical objective is to measure permitting trends for all addresses, we recommend using the primary address building permits dataset.\n\n<b>Note:</b> if you need to open this dataset in Excel, use one of the pre-filtered datasets. Opening the main dataset in Excel will cause some data to be lost as there are more than one million rows in the full dataset.\n\n1. <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/p4e4-a5a7\">Building Permits filed on or after January 1, 2013</a></u>\n2. <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/4jpb-z4kk\">Building Permits filed before January 1, 2013</a></u> \n\n<strong>E.

{"resource": {"name": "Dwelling Unit Completion Counts by Building Permit", "id": "j67f-aayr", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "A. SUMMARY \n\nThis dataset reports the number of new residential units made available for occupancy in San Francisco since January 2018. Each row in this dataset shows the change in the number of new units associated with a building permit application. Each row also includes the date those units were approved for occupancy, the type of document approving them, and their address.\n\nValues in the column [Number of Units Certified] can be added together to produce a count of new units approved for occupancy since January 2018. \n\nThese records provide a preliminary count of new residential units. The San Francisco Planning Department issues a Housing Inventory Report each year that provides a more complete account of new residential units, and those results may vary slightly from records in this dataset. The Housing Inventory Report is an in-depth annual research project requiring extensive work to validate information about projects. By comparison, this dataset is meant to provide more timely updates about housing production based on available administrative data. The Department of Building Inspection and Planning Department will reconcile these records with future Housing Inventory Reports.\n\nB. METHODOLOGY \n\nAt the end of each month, DBI staff manually calculate how many new units are available for occupancy for each building permit application and enters that information into this dataset. These records reflect counts for all types of residential units, including authorized accessory dwelling units. These records do not reflect units demolished or removed from the city\u2019s available housing stock.\n\nMultiple records may be associated with the same building permit application number, which means that new certifications or amendments were issued. Only changes to the net number of units associated with that permit application are recorded in subsequent records. \n\nFor example, Building Permit Application Number [201601010001] located at [123 1st Avenue] was issued an [Initial TCO] Temporary Certificate of Occupancy on [January 1, 2018] approving 10 units for occupancy. Then, an [Amended TCO] was issued on [June 1, 2018] approving [5] additional units for occupancy, for a total of 15 new units associated with that Building Permit Application Number. The building will appear as twice in the dataset, each row representing when new units were approved.\n\nIf additional or amended certifications are issued for a building permit application, but they do not change the number of units associated with that building permit application, those certifications are not recorded in this dataset. For example, if all new units associated with a project are certified for occupancy under an Initial TCO, then the Certificate of Final Completion (CFC) would not appear in the dataset because the CFC would not add new units to the housing stock.\nSee data definitions for more details.\n\nC. UPDATE FREQUENCY \n\nThis dataset is updated monthly.\n\nD. DOCUMENT TYPES\n\nSeveral documents issued near or at project completion can certify units for occupation. They are: Initial Temporary Certificate of Occupancy (TCO), Amended TCO, and Certificate of Final Completion (CFC). \n\n\u2022\tInitial TCO is a document that allows for occupancy of a unit before final project completion is certified, conditional on if the unit can be occupied safely. The TCO is meant to be temporary and has an expiration date. This field represents the number of units certified for occupancy when the TCO is issued. \n\u2022\tAmended TCO is a document that is issued when the conditions of the project are changed before final project completion is certified. These records show additional new units that have become habitable since the issuance of the Initial TCO. \n\u2022\tCertificate of Final Completion (CFC) is a document that is issued when all work is completed according to approved plans, and the building is ready for complete occupancy.

The date on which each population characteristic type was archived can be found in the field \u201cdata_loaded_at\u201d.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nData on the population characteristics of COVID-19 cases are from:\u202f \n* Case interviews\u202f \n* Laboratories\u202f \n* Medical providers\u202f \n\u202f \nThese multiple streams of data are merged, deduplicated, and undergo data verification processes. \u202f\n\n<u> Race/ethnicity</u>\n* We include all race/ethnicity categories that are collected for COVID-19 cases.\n* The population estimates for the \"Other\" or \u201cMulti-racial\u201d groups should be considered with caution. The Census definition is likely not exactly aligned with how the City collects this data. For that reason, we do not recommend calculating population rates for these groups.\n\n<u> Gender</u>\n* The City collects information on gender identity using <a href=\"https://www.sfdph.org/dph/files/PoliciesProcedures/COM5_SexGenderGuidelines.pdf\">these guidelines</a>. \n\n<u>Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) occupancy</u>\n* A Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) is a type of long-term care facility that provides care to individuals, generally in their 60s and older, who need functional assistance in their daily lives.\u202f \n* This dataset includes data for COVID-19 cases reported in Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs) through 12/31/2022, archived on 1/5/2023. These data were identified where \u201cCharacteristic_Type\u201d = \u2018Skilled Nursing Facility Occupancy\u2019. \n \n<u>Sexual orientation</u>\n* The City began asking adults 18 years old or older for their sexual orientation identification during case interviews as of April 28, 2020. Sexual orientation data prior to this date is unavailable. \n* The City doesn\u2019t collect or report information about sexual orientation for persons under 12 years of age. \n* Case investigation interviews transitioned to the California Department of Public Health, Virtual Assistant information gathering beginning December 2021. The Virtual Assistant is only sent to adults who are 18+ years old.\u202f<a href = \"https://www.sfdph.org/dph/files/PoliciesProcedures/COM9_SexualOrientationGuidelines.pdf\">Learn more about our data collection guidelines pertaining to sexual orientation</a>. \n \n<u>Comorbidities</u>\n* Underlying conditions are reported when a person has one or more underlying health conditions at the time of diagnosis or death. \n \n<u>Homelessness</u>\nPersons are identified as homeless based on several data sources: \n* self-reported living situation \n* the location at the time of testing \n* Department of Public Health homelessness and health databases \n* Residents in Single-Room Occupancy hotels are not included in these figures. \nThese methods serve as an estimate of persons experiencing homelessness. They may not meet other homelessness definitions. \n \n<u>Single Room Occupancy (SRO) tenancy</u>\n* SRO buildings are defined by the San Francisco Housing Code as having six or more \"residential guest rooms\" which may be attached to shared bathrooms, kitchens, and living spaces. \n* The details of a person's living arrangements are verified during case interviews. \n \n<u>Transmission Type</u>\n* Information on transmission of COVID-19 is based on case interviews with individuals who have a confirmed positive test. Individuals are asked if they have been in close contact with a known COVID-19 case. If they answer yes, transmission category is recorded as contact with a known case. If they report no contact with a known case, transmission category is recorded as community transmission. If the case is not interviewed or was not asked the question, they are counted as unknown.\n\n<strong>C.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset is a cleaned and anonymized version of survey data gathered in FY23 from nonprofits who contract with the City and County of San Francisco. Each row is one employee (representing one filled position), and data includes wages, position detail, position requirements, and demographic information as supplied by the person's employing organization. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis dataset was generated through conducting a two-tiered survey gathering data on organizational characteristics and position-level data from nonprofits who contract with the City and County of San Francisco in FY23. The survey was fielded in October and November of 2022. 152 nonprofits provided organizational-level data and summary data about their workforce. 29 of those organizations (referred to as \"Cohort Organizations\") provided additional position-level wage, demographic, and position-requirement data for each worker employed by their organization. This dataset includes position-level data from the cohort organizations. For further details on survey methodology, please review page 39 of the Nonprofit Wage and Equity Survey report, linked below in \"Related Reports.\"\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nData is a one-time survey and will not update.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nReview code book, attached in the \"About this Dataset\" section. \n\n<strong>E.

Areas within this boundary are highly likely to experience \u201cdeep and contiguous\u201d flooding during a 100-year storm. A 100-year storm is a storm that has a 1% chance of occurring in a given year. \u201cDeep and contiguous flooding\u201d means flooding at least 6-inches deep spanning an area at least the size of an average City block. The 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Zone does not provide the exact depth of flooding at a given location. It also does not show areas in the City that may experience shallower and/or more localized flooding in a 100-year storm. Finally, the 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Zone shows flood risk from storm runoff only. It does not consider flood risk in San Francisco from other causes such as shoreline overtopping and overland inundation from the San Francisco Bay or Pacific Ocean.\n\nIn addition to the 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Zone, the 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Map shows: \n\n\u2022\t\u201cAreas not served by the Combined Sewer and Stormwater Collection System\u201d - showing where data for rainfall driven storm runoff is not available, and where flood risk has not been analyzed.\n\u2022\t\u201cHistorical Shoreline\u201d, \u201cHistorical Creeks\u201d, and \u201cHistorical Waterbodies\u201d - historical hydrology layers to illustrate the general topography of low-lying areas in the City.\nThe Horizontal Datum used for the GIS layers is \u201cNAD_1983_2011_StatePlane_California_III_FIPS_0403_Ft_US.\u201d\n\nNotes on Usage\n\nAt a minimum, the 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Map is updated by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) on an annual basis on or before July 1 to account for any parcel review requests that remove properties from the Flood Zone.

SUMMARY</strong>\nSan Francisco\u2019s Existing Buildings Energy Performance Ordinance requires owners of non-residential buildings over 10,000 square feet to annually benchmark and disclose energy performance. On behalf of City agencies, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) benchmarks and reports energy use for a portfolio of approximately 500 public facilities buildings. The performance of public facilities can be examined in an interactive report at bit.ly/SFMunicipalBenchmarking, and annual reports from 2011-present are available there as well.\n \nThis dataset presents the energy performance and basic characteristics for public facilities that is visualized by the SFPUC\u2019s interactive report.  \n \nIn addition, energy performance data for non-municipal buildings (i.e. commercial buildings of 10,000 square feet or larger, and multifamily & mixed-use buildings of 50,000 square feet or larger) is available at: bit.ly/ExistingBuildingsReport\n\n<strong>B.

Details for public facilities are compiled from city records, and energy usage is compiled from utility records; related metrics such as energy use intensity are calculated from the combination of such records. Data is subjected to quality assurance validation prior to publication.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Testing by Race/Ethnicity Over Time", "id": "kja3-qsky", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset includes San Francisco COVID-19 tests by race/ethnicity and by date. This dataset represents the daily count of tests collected, and the breakdown of test results (positive, negative, or indeterminate). Tests in this dataset include all those collected from persons who listed San Francisco as their home address at the time of testing. It also includes tests that were collected by San Francisco providers for persons who were missing a locating address. This dataset does not include tests for residents listing a locating address outside of San Francisco, even if they were tested in San Francisco. \n\nThe data were de-duplicated by individual and date, so if a person gets tested multiple times on different dates, all tests will be included in this dataset (on the day each test was collected). If a person tested multiple times on the same date, only one test is included from that date. When there are multiple tests on the same date, a positive result, if one exists, will always be selected as the record for the person. If a PCR and antigen test are taken on the same day, the PCR test will supersede. If a person tests multiple times on the same day and the results are all the same (e.g. all negative or all positive) then the first test done is selected as the record for the person.\n\n<strong>The total number of positive test results is not equal to the total number of COVID-19 cases in San Francisco.</strong>\n\nWhen a person gets tested for COVID-19, they may be asked to report information about themselves. One piece of information that might be requested is a person's race and ethnicity. These data are often incomplete in the laboratory and provider reports of the test results sent to the health department. The data can be missing or incomplete for several possible reasons:\n\n\t\u2022 The person was not asked about their race and ethnicity.\n\t\u2022 The person was asked, but refused to answer.\n\t\u2022 The person answered, but the testing provider did not include the person's answers in the reports.\n\t\u2022 The testing provider reported the person's answers in a format that could not be used by the health department.\n\nFor any of these reasons, a person's race/ethnicity will be recorded in the dataset as \u201cUnknown.\u201d\n\n<strong>B. NOTE ON RACE/ETHNICITY</strong>\nThe different values for Race/Ethnicity in this dataset are \"Asian;\" \"Black or African             American;\" \"Hispanic or Latino/a, all races;\" \"American Indian or Alaska Native;\" \"Native                           Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander;\" \"White;\" \"Multi-racial;\" \"Other;\" and \u201cUnknown.\"\n\nThe Race/Ethnicity categorization increases data clarity by emulating the methodology used by the U.S. Census in the American Community Survey. Specifically, persons who identify as \"Asian,\" \"Black or African American,\" \"American Indian or Alaska Native,\" \"Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,\" \"White,\" \"Multi-racial,\" or \"Other\" do NOT include any person who identified as Hispanic/Latino at any time in their testing reports that either (1) identified them as SF residents or (2) as someone who tested without a locating address by an SF provider. All persons across all races who identify as Hispanic/Latino are recorded as \u201c\"Hispanic or Latino/a, all races.\" This categorization increases data accuracy by correcting the way \u201cOther\u201d persons were counted.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Deaths by Population Characteristics Over Time", "id": "kkr3-wq7h", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>Note: In early September 2023, a revised definition of a COVID-19 death will be adopted to align with the definition used by the California Department of Public Health. This will affect COVID-19 deaths reported retrospectively to 1/1/2023. More information about the updated death definition is available <a href=\"https://preparedness.cste.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CSTE-Revised-Classification-of-COVID-19-associated-Deaths.Final_.11.22.22.pdf\">here</a>.</strong>\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset shows San Francisco COVID-19 deaths by population characteristics and by date. This data may not be immediately available for recently reported deaths. Data updates as more information becomes available.\u202fBecause of this, death totals for previous days may increase or decrease. More recent data is less reliable.\n\nPopulation characteristics are subgroups, or demographic cross-sections, like age, race, or gender. The City tracks how deaths have been distributed among different subgroups. This information can reveal trends and disparities among groups.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nAs of January 1, 2023, COVID-19 deaths are defined as persons who had COVID-19 listed as a cause of death or a significant condition contributing to their death on their death certificate. This definition is in alignment with the California Department of Public Health and the national <a href = \"https://preparedness.cste.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CSTE-Revised-Classification-of-COVID-19-associated-Deaths.Final_.11.22.22.pdf\">Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists</a>. Death certificates are maintained by the California Department of Public Health.\n\nData on the population characteristics of COVID-19 deaths are from: \n*Case reports \n*Medical records \n*Electronic lab reports \n*Death certificates \n\nData are continually updated to maximize completeness of information and reporting on San Francisco COVID-19 deaths. \n\nTo protect resident privacy, we summarize COVID-19 data by only one characteristic at a time. Data are not shown until cumulative citywide deaths reach five or more. \n \nData notes on each population characteristic type is listed below.\n\n<u> Race/ethnicity</u> \n* We include all race/ethnicity categories that are collected for COVID-19 cases.\n\n<u>Gender</u>\n* The City collects information on gender identity using <u><a href=\"https://www.sfdph.org/dph/files/PoliciesProcedures/COM5_SexGenderGuidelines.pdf\">these guidelines</a></u>.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 06:30 and 07:30 AM Pacific Time on Wednesday each week.\n\nDataset will not update on the business day following any federal holiday.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nPopulation estimates are only available for age groups and race/ethnicity categories. San Francisco population estimates for race/ethnicity and age groups can be found in a <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/cedd-86uf\">view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset</a>. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS). \n\nThis dataset includes many different types of characteristics. Filter the \u201cCharacteristic Type\u201d column to explore a topic area. Then, the \u201cCharacteristic Group\u201d column shows each group or category within that topic area and the number of deaths on each date. \n\nNew deaths are the count of deaths within that characteristic group on that specific date. Cumulative deaths are the running total of all San Francisco COVID-19 deaths in that characteristic group up to the date listed.\n\nThis data may not be immediately available for more recent deaths. Data updates as more information becomes available. \n\nTo explore data on the total number of deaths, use <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-19-Deaths-Over-Time/g2di-xufg\">the COVID-19 Deaths Over Time dataset</a></u>.\n\n<strong>E.

An \u201cinterested party\u201d is a person who is a party, participant or agent of a party or participant to certain types of proceedings before the official in question. Those proceedings are limited to administrative enforcement proceedings and proceedings regarding permits, licenses, or other entitlements for use. A party to such a proceeding is someone who files an application for a license, permit, or entitlement for use or is the subject of the administrative enforcement. A participant in such a proceeding is someone who is not a party to the proceeding but who actively supports or opposes a particular decision in the proceeding and has a financial interest in the decision. An agent is someone who represents a party or a participant in such a proceeding.\n\nThe filing deadline for Form SFEC-3610(b) depends on the circumstances under which the behested payment was made.\n\nIf the behested payment was made while the proceeding involving the interested party is pending before the official, then the form must be filed within thirty days of the payment being made. If there is a series of behested payments, the form is due within 30 days of the payment that makes the total $1,000 or more.\n\nIf the behested payment was made within six months following the date on which a final decision was made in the proceeding involving the interested party, then the form must be filed within thirty days of the payment. If there is a series of behested payments, the form is due within 30 days of the payment that makes the total $1,000 or more.\n\nFinally, if the behested payment was made in the 12 months prior to the commencement of the proceeding involving the interested party, the form is due within 30 days of the date the official knew or should have known that the source of the behested payment became an interested party.\n\nEach row in this dataset represents information about payors reported in the \"Payors Information\" sub-table of a Form SFEC-3610(b) filed with the Ethics Commission.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Testing Over Time", "id": "nfpa-mg4g", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nCase information on COVID-19 Laboratory testing. This data includes a daily count of test results reported, and how many of those were positive, negative, and indeterminate. Reported tests include tests with a positive, negative or indeterminate result. Indeterminate results, which could not conclusively determine whether COVID-19 virus was present, are not included in the calculation of percent positive. Testing for the novel coronavirus is available through commercial, clinical, and hospital laboratories, as well as the SFDPH Public Health Laboratory.\n\nTests are de-duplicated by an individual and date. This means that if a person gets tested multiple times on different dates in the last 30 days, all of those individual tests will be included in this data as individual tests (on each specimen collection date).\n\n<strong>Total positive test results is not equal to the total number of COVID-19 cases in San Francisco.</strong>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nLaboratory test volume and positivity for COVID-19 is based on electronic laboratory test reports. Deduplication, quality assurance measures and other data verification processes maximize accuracy of laboratory test information.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nDue to the high degree of variation in the time needed to complete tests by different labs there is a delay in this reporting. On March 24 the Health Officer ordered all labs in the City to report complete COVID-19 testing information to the local and state health departments. In order to track trends over time, a data user can analyze this data by \"result_date\" and see how the count of reported results and positivity rate have changed over time.\n\n<strong>E. CHANGE LOG</strong>\n<UL><LI>6/21/2023 - A small number of additional COVID-19 testing records were released as part of our ongoing data cleaning efforts. \n<LI>1/31/2023 - renamed column \u201clast_updated_at\u201d to \u201cdata_as_of\u201d. \n<LI>1/31/2023 - added columns \u201ccumulative_tests\u201d, \u201ccumulative_positive_tests\u201d, \u201ccumulative_negative_tests\u201d, \u201ccumulative_indeterminate_tests\u201d. \n<LI>4/16/2021 - dataset updated to refresh with a five-day data lag.</UL>", "attribution": "Department of Public Health - Population Health Division", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-09-17T16:02:06.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-04-06T17:31:05.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-09-17T16:02:04.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-09-17T16:02:06.000Z", "columns_name": ["tests", "cumulative_positive_tests", "data_loaded_at", "neg", "cumulative_negative_tests", "cumulative_tests", "data_as_of", "pos", "cumulative_indeterminate_tests", "specimen_collection_date", "indeterminate", "pct"], "columns_field_name": ["tests", "cumulative_positive_tests", "data_loaded_at", "neg", "cumulative_negative_tests", "cumulative_tests", "data_as_of", "pos", "cumulative_indeterminate_tests", "specimen_collection_date", "indeterminate", "pct"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Total tests collected on the specified date", "Cumulative positive tests collected as of the specified date", "Timestamp when data entered the Socrata system", "Negative tests collected on the specified date", "Cumulative negative tests collected as of the specified date", "Total cumulative tests collected as of the specified date", "Timestamp for last update date in source system", "Positive tests collected on the specified date", "Cumulative indeterminate tests collected as of the specified date", "Date that test was collected\u202f", "Indeterminate tests collected on the specified date ", "Percent of tests that are positive on the specified date, as calculated by: the sum of all positive tests divided by the total number of positive and negative tests (indeterminate tests are excluded) "], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"view": "date_ymd"}, {}, {"precision": "3"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2023-01-31T18:15:07.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["public safety"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "COVID-19", "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Department-Metrics_Publishing-Department", "value": "Public Health"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Publishing-frequency", "value": "Daily"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Data-change-frequency", "value": "Daily"}, {"key": "Detailed-Descriptive_Geographic-unit", "value": "Other"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.sfgov.org", "license": "Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License"}, "permalink": "https://data.sfgov.org/d/nfpa-mg4g", "link": "https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-19-Testing-Over-Time/nfpa-mg4g", "owner": {"id": "dbag-6qd9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "OpenData"}, "creator": {"id": "dbag-6qd9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "OpenData"}}

Survey methodology was changed in 2015 from a mail to a phone survey, and expanded to include in-person and online options in 2023. Comparisons to previous years should be interpreted with caution. \n\nResults should be weighted using the column \"weight\" in order to adjust for demographic differences between the City Survey sample and San Francisco's population. Please note that survey results were originally reported as unweighted until 1997. From 1997 onward, all City Survey results were reweighted with the exception of data from 2011. For ease of use, the column \"weight\" has been coded with a value of one for these years. \n\nA code book is also attached to this dataset under About > Attachments.

{"resource": {"name": "Traffic Crashes Resulting in Injury: Victims Involved", "id": "nwes-mmgh", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis table contains all victims (parties who are injured) involved in a traffic crash resulting in an injury in the City of San Francisco. Fatality year-to-date crash data is obtained from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OME) death records, and only includes those cases that meet the San Francisco Vision Zero Fatality Protocol maintained by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH), San Francisco Police Department (SFPD), and San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). Injury crash data is obtained from SFPD\u2019s Interim Collision System for 2018 to YTD, Crossroads Software Traffic Collision Database (CR) for years 2013-2017 and the Statewide Integrated Transportation Record System (SWITRS) maintained by the California Highway Patrol for all years prior to 2013. Only crashes with valid geographic information are mapped. All geocodable crash data is represented on the simplified San Francisco street centerline model maintained by the Department of Public Works (SFDPW). Collision injury data is queried and aggregated on a quarterly basis. Crashes occurring at complex intersections with multiple roadways are mapped onto a single point and injury and fatality crashes occurring on highways are excluded.\n\nThe crash, party, and victim tables have a relational structure. The traffic crashes table contains information on each crash, one record per crash. The party table contains information from all parties involved in the crashes, one record per party. Parties are individuals involved in a traffic crash including drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and parked vehicles. The victim table contains information about each party injured in the collision, including any passengers. Injury severity is included in the victim table. \n\nFor example, a crash occurs (1 record in the crash table) that involves a driver party and a pedestrian party (2 records in the party table). Only the pedestrian is injured and thus is the only victim (1 record in the victim table).\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nTraffic crash injury data is collected from the California Highway Patrol 555 Crash Report as submitted by the police officer within 30 days after the crash occurred. All fields that match the SWITRS data schema are programmatically extracted, de-identified, geocoded, and loaded into TransBASE. See Section D below for details regarding TransBASE. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nAfter review by SFPD and SFDPH staff, the data is made publicly available approximately a month after the end of the previous quarter (May for Q1, August for Q2, November for Q3, and February for Q4). \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis data is being provided as public information as defined under San Francisco and California public records laws. SFDPH, SFMTA, and SFPD cannot limit or restrict the use of this data or its interpretation by other parties in any way. Where the data is communicated, distributed, reproduced, mapped, or used in any other way, the user should acknowledge TransBASE.sfgov.org as the source of the data, provide a reference to the original data source where also applicable, include the date the data was pulled, and note any caveats specified in the associated metadata documentation provided. However, users should not attribute their analysis or interpretation of this data to the City of San Francisco. While the data has been collected and/or produced for the use of the City of San Francisco, it cannot guarantee its accuracy or completeness. Accordingly, the City of San Francisco, including SFDPH, SFMTA, and SFPD make no representation as to the accuracy of the information or its suitability for any purpose and disclaim any liability for omissions or errors that may be contained therein. As all data is associated with methodological assumptions and limitations, the City recommends that users review methodological documentation associated with the data prior to its analy",

{"resource": {"name": "Sheriff Jail Bookings by Age Group", "id": "pfbp-75pz", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nTo confirm the completeness of this dataset please contact the Sheriff's Office at sheriff.tech.services@sfgov.org\n\nThe dataset provides summary information on individuals booked into the San Francisco City and County Jail since 2012, categorized by age group. The table provides a breakdown of the total number of bookings by month and age group. The unit of measure is the jail booking number. The data is collected by the Sheriff's Office and includes self-reported and assigned data.\n\nThe booking process refers to the procedure that occurs after an individual has been arrested and is taken into custody. The process begins with the arrest of an individual by law enforcement officers. The arrest can take place on the scene or at a later time if a warrant is issued. Once the individual has been arrested, and statutory law requires incarceration, they would be transported to the jail for booking. The arresting officer will record the reason for the arrest, along with any other relevant information. The sheriff\u2019s deputies will then book the individual into jail, which involves taking their fingerprints, photograph, and recording personal information. The jail will assign a booking number, which is used to identify the individual throughout their time in custody. Once the booking process is complete, the individual will be incarcerated and will remain in custody until they are released per court order.\n\nDisclaimer: The San Francisco Sheriff's Office does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information as the data is subject to change as modifications and updates are completed.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nWhen an arrest is presented to the Sheriff\u2019s Office, relevant data is manually entered into the Sheriff Office's jail management system. Data reports are pulled from this system on a semi-regular basis, and added to Open Data.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThis dataset is scheduled to update monthly\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis data can be used to identify trends and patterns in the jail population over time. The date in this dataset is based on the date the suspect was booked into county jail for the arresting incident. The unit of measurement for this dataset is the booking number. A jail booking number is a unique identifier assigned to each individual who is booked into a jail facility. It is used to track the individual throughout their time in custody and to link their records to other relevant information, such as court appearances and medical records. \n\n<strong>E.

This dataset combines all schedules, pages, and includes unitemized totals. Only transactions from the \"most recent\" version of a filing (original/amendment) appear here.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCommittees file campaign statements with the Ethics Commission on a periodic basis. Those statements are stored with the Commission's data provider. Data is generally presented as-filed by committees.\n\nIf a committee files an amendment, the data from that filing completely replaces the original and any prior amendments in the filing sequence.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nEach night starting at midnight Pacific time a script runs to check for new filings with the Commission's database, and updates this dataset with transactions from new filings. The update process can take a variable amount of time to complete. Viewing or downloading this dataset while the update is running may result in incomplete data, therefore it is highly recommended to view or download this data before midnight or after 8am.\n\nDuring the update, some fields are copied from the Filings dataset into this dataset for viewing convenience. The copy process may occasionally fail for some transactions due to timing issues but should self-correct the following day. Transactions with a blank 'Filing Id Number' or 'Filing Date' field are such transactions, but can be joined with the appropriate record using the 'Filing Activity Nid' field shared between Filing and Transaction datasets.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>  \nTransactions from rejected filings are not included in this dataset. Transactions from many different FPPC forms and schedules are combined in this dataset, refer to the column \"Form Type\" to differentiate transaction types.\nProperties suffixed with \"-nid\" can be used to join the data between Filers, Filings, and Transaction datasets.\nRefer to the <a href=\"https://sfethics.org/disclosures/campaign-finance-disclosure/campaign-finance-disclosure-data\">Ethics

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Testing by Geography Over Time", "id": "qhc5-mubk", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset includes COVID-19 tests by resident neighborhood and specimen collection date (the day the test was collected). Specifically, this dataset includes tests of San Francisco residents who listed a San Francisco home address at the time of testing. These resident addresses were then geo-located and mapped to neighborhoods. The resident address associated with each test is hand-entered and susceptible to errors, therefore neighborhood data should be interpreted as an approximation, not a precise nor comprehensive total.\n\nIn recent months, about 5% of tests are missing addresses and therefore cannot be included in any neighborhood totals. In earlier months, more tests were missing address data. Because of this high percentage of tests missing resident address data, this neighborhood testing data for March, April, and May should be interpreted with caution (see below)\n\nPercentage of tests missing address information, by month in 2020\nMar - 33.6%\nApr - 25.9%\nMay - 11.1%\nJun - 7.2%\nJul - 5.8%\nAug - 5.4%\nSep - 5.1%\nOct (Oct 1-12) - 5.1%\n\nTo protect the privacy of residents, the City does not disclose the number of tests in neighborhoods with resident populations of fewer than 1,000 people. These neighborhoods are omitted from the data (they include Golden Gate Park, John McLaren Park, and Lands End).\n\nTests for residents that listed a Skilled Nursing Facility as their home address are not included in this neighborhood-level testing data. Skilled Nursing Facilities have required and repeated testing of residents, which would change neighborhood trends and not reflect the broader neighborhood's testing data.\n\nThis data was de-duplicated by individual and date, so if a person gets tested multiple times on different dates, all tests will be included in this dataset (on the day each test was collected). \n\n<strong>The total number of positive test results is not equal to the total number of COVID-19 cases in San Francisco. </strong>During this investigation, some test results are found to be for persons living outside of San Francisco and some people in San Francisco may be tested multiple times (which is common). To see the number of new confirmed cases by neighborhood, reference this map: https://sf.gov/data/covid-19-case-maps#new-cases-maps\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCOVID-19 laboratory test data is based on electronic laboratory test reports. Deduplication, quality assurance measures and other data verification processes maximize accuracy of laboratory test information. All testing data is then geo-coded by resident address. Then data is aggregated by analysis neighborhood and specimen collection date.\n\nData are prepared by close of business Monday through Saturday for public display.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nSan Francisco population estimates for geographic regions can be found in a <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/35v5-seg9\">view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset</a>. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS). \n\nDue to the high degree of variation in the time needed to complete tests by different labs there is a delay in this reporting. On March 24 the Health Officer ordered all labs in the City to report complete COVID-19 testing information to the local and state health departments. \n\nIn order to track trends over time, a data user can analyze this data by \"specimen_collection_date\".\n\nCalculating Percent Positivity: The positivity rate is the percentage of tests that return a positive result for COVID-19 (positive tests divided by the sum of positive and negative tests).

Committees can change names over time.\n\nRefer to the <a href=\"https://sfethics.org/disclosures/campaign-finance-disclosure/campaign-finance-disclosure-data\">Ethics Commission's webpage</a> for more information.\n\n<strong>RELATED DATASETS</strong>\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Campaign-Finance-San-Francisco-Campaign-Filers/4c8t-ngau\">San Francisco Campaign Filers</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Campaign-Finance-Filings-Received-by-SFEC/qizs-bwft\">Filings Received by SFEC</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Campaign-Finance-Summary-Totals/9ggq-m8hp\">Summary Totals</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Campaign-Finance-Transactions/pitq-e56w\">Transactions</a></li>\n</ul>", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-09-16T08:14:09.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-03-01T23:14:09.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-08-22T17:24:58.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-09-16T08:14:09.000Z", "columns_name": ["Filing Start Date", "Data Loaded At", "Data As Of", "Redacted Rendering Nid", "Current Status", "Publish Sequence", "Filing Activity Nid", "Filing Nid", "Report Number", "Filer Name", "Filing Id Number", "Filing DateTime", "Filer Nid", "Filer FPPC Id", "Sync Status", "Filing Type", "Filing End Date", "Filing Date", "Attachments Nids", "Has Efile Content", "Filing Version", "Form Type", "Is Termination", "Sync Flag", "Rejected", "Filing Mechanism", "Rendering URL"], "columns_field_name": ["start_date", "data_loaded_at", "data_as_of", "redacted_rendering_nid", "current_status", "publish_sequence", "filing_activity_nid", "filing_nid", "report_number", "filer_name", "filing_id_number", "filing_datetime", "filer_nid", "fppc_id", "sync_status", "filing_type", "end_date", "filing_date", "attachments_nids", "has_efile_content", "filing_version", "form_type", "is_termination", "sync_flag", "rejected", "mechanism_type", "rendering_url"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Text", "Checkbox", "Number", "Text", "Checkbox", "Checkbox", "Checkbox", "Text", "URL"], "columns_description": ["Starting date of the filing period for the filing (if applicable)", "Date the record was uploaded to the portal", "Date the record was added to source", "id for redacted PDF rendering", "If this filing is superceded, the filingid that supercedes it; if current, the date of the sync update to this dataset; if this field is blank, there was an error during the sync update", "Netfile publishSequence number", "Unique identifier for the submition of a filing (original, amendment, correction).

Trips by visitors to the Bay Area and for commercial purposes are not included.\n\u2022 Provide additional trip details, including trip purpose for each trip in the mode share question series.\n\u2022 Collect demographic data on the population of Bay Area residents who travel to, from, and within San Francisco.\n\u2022 Collect data on travel behavior and opinions that support other SFMTA strategy and project evaluation needs.\n\nThe survey was conducted as a telephone study among 801 Bay Area residents aged 18 and older. Interviewing was conducted in English, Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Tagalog. Surveying was conducted via random digit dial (RDD) and cell phone sample.\nAll survey datasets incorporate respondent weighting based on age and home location; utilize the \u201cweight\u201d field when appropriate in your analysis.\n\nThe survey period for this survey is as follows:\n2019: May - August 2019\n\nThe margin of error is related to sample size (n). For the total sample, the margin of error is 3.3% for a confidence level of 95%. When looking at subsets of the data, such as just the SF population, just the female population, or just the population of people who bicycle, the sample size decreases and the margin of error increases. Below is a guide of the margin of error for different samples sizes. Be cautious in making conclusions based off of small sample sizes.\n\nAt the 95% confidence level is:\n\u2022 n = 801(Total Sample). Margin of error = +/- 3.3%\n\u2022 n = 400. Margin of error = +/- 4.85%\n\u2022 n = 100.

{"resource": {"name": "Aircraft Noise Climates", "id": "qxw2-ncq3", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nSan Francisco International Airport (SFO) keeps track of aircraft noise levels in communities around the airport 24/7. Measured aircraft noise events are used in calculations to determine Aircraft Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL). This noise metric is used to assess and regulate aircraft noise exposure in residential communities surrounding the airport. The annual Aircraft CNEL helps validate the 65\u2010decibel noise impact contour, an output of computer noise modeling.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis dataset consists of measured aircraft noise events at each of SFO\u2019s 29 community noise monitoring sites. Also provided as part of this dataset is ANEEM Aircraft CNEL. This aircraft climate is derived using ANEEM algorithms that can measure quieter aircraft noise levels below that of conventional threshold correlation methodology resulting in improved noise to aircraft correlations.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nData is available starting in March 2017. Aircraft climates derived using ANEEM algorithms are available starting January 2023.

The location also includes the Cultural Districts and Supervisor District that an artwork resides in. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nDataset is exported manually by staff from internal collections database and re-formatted manually by staff.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nDataset is updated as needed manually by staff.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nArtworks may be located at a specific addresses (traditional building number, street name format) or other locations (City Parks, Piers, SFO, etc.) that don't meet the traditional address format; in these cases, the closest intersection or building address has been used. Please look at the \"Location Description\" field for the location of the artwork (floor 2, International terminal, Northwest corner, etc.). An individual artwork can consist of a single piece or multiple pieces, this will be reflected in the last part of it's accession number with either a letter or number (i.e. 1904.2.a-b or 1999.22.1-2). A single artwork may have multiple entries, one for each part, or may have a single group entry. Therefore, the number of entries is not equivalent to the number of artworks. Generally, if an artworks' pieces are spread out over a distance, each piece will have an entry and if they are grouped at one location, there will be one group entry. When an artwork spans multiple blocks one end point was chosen for the address/map point. The data column \"number_of_districts\" refers to how many Cultural Districts a mural is in.

SUMMARY</strong>\nData on daily hospital bed use and available capacity at San Francisco acute care hospitals from April 2020 onward. Long Term Care facilities (like Laguna Honda and Kentfield) are not included in this data as acute care patients cannot be admitted to these facilities.\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis hospital capacity information is based on data that all SF acute care hospitals report to the San Francisco Department of Public Health.\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. This data is on a 4-day lag to account for the time needed to complete and validate data from all SF acute care hospitals. \n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis data provides visibility into current occupancy levels and use of San Francisco acute care hospitals and potential ability to accommodate anticipated surges of COVID patients. \nData includes current census of COVID-19 patients (including both confirmed cases and suspected COVID patients) and other patients in acute care hospitals, shown in the \u201cStatus\u201d column. The \u201cStatus\u201d column also includes all available beds.\nThis daily census information is stratified by type of bed (acute care, intensive care, and surge) in the \u201cBed Type\u201d column. Acute care beds treat patients with illnesses and injuries including recovery from surgeries. Intensive care (ICU) beds are for sicker patients in need of critical and life support services that can include the use of a ventilator. Surge beds are the additional beds that can be made available to handle an influx of COVID-19 patients; surge beds are differentiated between acute care surge beds and ICU surge beds.\nNote: The current census of COVID patients shown here may not always match the hospitalizations data (https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-19-Hospitalizations/nxjg-bhem), as that data includes all hospitals and long term care facilities.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Vaccinations Given to SF Residents Over Time", "id": "rutu-rpar", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong> \nThis dataset represents the COVID-19 vaccinations given to residents of San Francisco over time. All vaccines given to SF residents are included, no matter where the vaccination took place (the vaccine may have been administered in San Francisco or outside of San Francisco). This dataset also includes COVID-19 vaccinations given to SF residents by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) over time. \n\nData provides counts for residents who have received at least one dose, residents who have completed a primary vaccine series, residents who have received one or two monovalent (not bivalent) booster doses, and residents who have received a bivalent booster dose. A primary vaccine series is complete after an individual has received all intended doses of the initial series. There are one, two, and three dose primary vaccine series. \n \n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong> \nInformation on doses administered to those who live in San Francisco is from the <a href=\"https://cdph.ca.gov/CAIR\">California Immunization Registry (CAIR2)</a>, run by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). \n \n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> \nUpdated daily via automated process \n \n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong> \nBefore analysis, you must filter the dataset to the desired stratification of data using the \"administering_provider_type\" column. To get vaccination counts of all SF residents regardless of provider, filter to \"administering_provider_type\" = \u2018All Providers\u2019. To get vaccination counts administered by SFDPH to SF residents, filter to \"administering_provider_type\" = \u2018DPH Only\u2019. \n\nTo count the number of individuals vaccinated (with any primary series dose) for the first time on a given day, use the \"new_recipients\" column. To count the number of individuals who have completed their primary vaccine series on a given day, use the \"new_series_completed\" column. To count the number of primary series doses administered on a day (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or single doses), use the \"new_primary_series_doses\" column. \n \nTo count the number of individuals who received their first or second monovalent (not bivalent) booster dose on a given day, use the \"new_booster_recipients\" and \"new_2nd_booster_recipients\" columns. To count the number of individuals who received their first bivalent booster dose on a given day, use the \"new_bivalent_booster_recipients\" column. To count the number of monovalent (not including bivalent) or bivalent booster doses administered on a given day, use the \"new_booster_doses\" or \"new_bivalent_booster_doses\" columns.  \n\nTo count the number of individuals who have received a vaccine up to a certain date, use the columns beginning with \"cumulative_...\" \n\n<strong>E. ARCHIVED DATA</strong> \nThis dataset is a combination of two previous datasets that were archived on 10/27/2022. For historical purposes, you can access the archived datasets at the following links:  \n\n<a href= \"https://data.sfgov.org/d/bqge-2y7k\">ARCHIVED: COVID Vaccinations Given to SF Residents Over Time</a> \n<a href= \"https://data.sfgov.org/d/9tca-udid\">ARCHIVED: COVID Vaccinations Given to SF Residents by SF DPH Over Time</a>\n\n<strong>F. CHANGE LOG</strong> \n<UL><LI>10/27/2022 - the datasets COVID Vaccinations Given to SF Residents Over Time and COVID Vaccinations Given to SF Residents by SF DPH Over Time were merged into a single dataset. The column \u201cadministering_provider_type\u201d can be used to filter between the two metrics. These previous datasets can be found in the ARCHIVED DATA section. \n<LI>10/27/2022 - the columns \u201cnew_1st_doses\u201d, \u201cnew_2nd_doses\u201d, and \u201cnew_single_doses\u201d were removed and consolidated into the column \u201cnew_primary_series_doses\u201d (which also includes 3rd doses for the Pfizer Under 5 series). Similarly, the columns \u201ccumulative_1st_doses\u201d, \u201ccumulative_2nd_doses\u201d, \u201ccumulative_single_doses\u201d, were replaced by \u201ccumulative_primary_series_doses\u201d.</UL>", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-09-17T15:17:03.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-10-05T21:59:47.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-09-17T15:17:01.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-09-17T15:17:03.000Z", "columns_name": ["new_2nd_booster_recipients", "new_bivalent_booster_recipients", "cumulative_booster_doses", "cumulative_primary_series_doses", "cumulative_series_completed", "cumulative_recipients", "administering_provider_type", "data_loaded_at", "data_as_of", "cumulative_bivalent_booster_recipients", "cumulative_bivalent_booster_doses", "data_updated_at", "date_administered", "new_primary_series_doses", "new_recipients", "new_bivalent_booster_doses", "new_series_completed", "new_booster_doses", "cumulative_2nd_booster_recipients", "new_booster_recipients", "cumulative_booster_recipients"], "columns_field_name": ["new_2nd_booster_recipients", "new_bivalent_booster_recipients", "cumulative_booster_doses", "cumulative_primary_series_doses", "cumulative_series_completed", "cumulative_recipients", "administering_provider_type", "data_loaded_at", "data_as_of", "cumulative_bivalent_booster_recipients", "cumulative_bivalent_booster_doses", "data_updated_at", "date_administered", "new_primary_series_doses", "new_recipients", "new_bivalent_booster_doses", "new_series_completed", "new_booster_doses", "cumulative_2nd_booster_recipients", "new_booster_recipients", "cumulative_booster_recipients"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Count of individuals who received their second monovalent booster dose.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Vaccinations Given to SF Residents by Demographics Over Time", "id": "sej3-bbrc", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong> \nThis dataset represents the COVID-19 vaccinations given to residents of San Francisco over time. All vaccines given to SF residents are included, no matter where the vaccination took place (the vaccine may have been administered in San Francisco or outside of San Francisco). The data are broken down by multiple demographic stratifications. This dataset also includes COVID-19 vaccinations given to SF residents by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) over time. \n\nData provides counts for residents who have received at least one dose, residents who have completed a primary vaccine series, residents who have received one or two monovalent (not bivalent) booster doses, and residents who have received a bivalent booster dose. A primary vaccine series is complete after an individual has received all intended doses of the initial series. There are one, two, and three dose primary vaccine series. \n \n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong> \nInformation on doses administered to those who live in San Francisco is from the <a href=\"https://cdph.ca.gov/CAIR \">California Immunization Registry (CAIR2)</a>, run by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The information on individuals\u2019 city of residence, age, race, and ethnicity are also recorded in CAIR and are self-reported at the time of vaccine administration. \n\nIn order to estimate the percent of San Franciscans vaccinated, we provide the 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) population estimates for each demographic group.\n \n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> \nUpdated daily via automated process \n \n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong> \nSan Francisco population estimates for race/ethnicity and age groups can be found in a <a href=\" https://data.sfgov.org/d/cedd-86uf\">view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset</a>. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS). \n\nBefore analysis, you must filter the dataset to the desired stratification of data using the \"overall_segment\" column. \n \nFor example, filtering \"overall_segment\" to \"All SF Residents by Age Bracket, Administered by All Providers\" will filter the data to residents whose vaccinations were administered by any provider. You can then further segment the data and calculate percentages by Age Brackets. \n \nIf you filter \"overall_segment\" to \"All SF Residents by Race/Ethnicity, Administered by DPH Only\", you will see the race/ethnicity breakdown for residents who received vaccinations from the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). \n\nIf you filter \"overall_segment\" to \"All SF Residents by Age Group, Administered by All Providers\" you will see vaccination counts of various age eligibility groups that were administered by any provider. \n\nTo count the number of individuals vaccinated (with any primary series dose) for the first time on a given day, use the \"new_recipients\" column. To count the number of individuals who have completed their primary vaccine series on a given day, use the \"new_series_completed\" column. To count the number of primary series doses administered on a day (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or single doses), use the \"new_primary_series_doses\" column. \n \nTo count the number of individuals who received their first or second monovalent (not bivalent) booster dose on a given day, use the \"new_booster_recipients\" and \"new_2nd_booster_recipients\" columns. To count the number of individuals who received their first bivalent booster dose on a given day, use the \"new_bivalent_booster_recipients\" column. To count the number of monovalent (not including bivalent) or bivalent booster doses administered on a given day, use the \"new_booster_doses\" or \"new_bivalent_booster_doses\" columns.  \n\nTo count the number of individuals who have received a vaccine up to a certain date, use the columns beginning with \"cumulative_...\" \n\n<strong>E.

{"resource": {"name": "ARCHIVED: COVID-19 Cases and Deaths Summarized by Geography", "id": "tpyr-dvnc", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>Note: In early September 2023, data on COVID-19 cases and deaths summarized by geography will be archived and will no longer update. A historic record of this data will remain available. </strong>\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nMedical provider confirmed COVID-19 cases and confirmed COVID-19 related deaths in San Francisco, CA aggregated by several different geographic areas and normalized by 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates for population data to calculate rate per 10,000 residents.\n\nOn September 12, 2021, a new case definition of COVID-19 was introduced that includes criteria for enumerating new infections after previous probable or confirmed infections (also known as reinfections). A reinfection is defined as a confirmed positive PCR lab test more than 90 days after a positive PCR or antigen test. The first reinfection case was identified on December 7, 2021.\n\nCases and deaths are both mapped to the residence of the individual, not to where they were infected or died. For example, if one was infected in San Francisco at work but lives in the East Bay, those are not counted as SF Cases or if one dies in Zuckerberg San Francisco General but is from another county, that is also not counted in this dataset.\n\nDataset is cumulative and covers cases going back to 3/2/2020 when testing began. \n\nGeographic areas summarized are:\n1. <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Analysis-Neighborhoods-2020-census-tracts-assigned/sevw-6tgi\">Analysis Neighborhoods</a>\n2. <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Census-2020-Tracts-for-San-Francisco/tmph-tgz9\">Census Tracts</a>\n3. <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html\">Census Zip Code Tabulation Areas</a>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nAddresses from medical data are geocoded by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). Those addresses are spatially joined to the geographic areas. Counts are generated based on the number of address points that match each geographic area. The 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) population estimates provided by the Census are used to create a rate which is equal to <i>([count] / [acs_population]) * 10000)</i> representing the number of cases per 10,000 residents.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nGeographic analysis is scripted by SFDPH staff and synced to this dataset daily at 7:30 Pacific Time. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nSan Francisco population estimates for geographic regions can be found in a <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/35v5-seg9\">view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset</a>. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS).\n\n<em>Privacy rules in effect</em>\nTo protect privacy, certain rules are in effect:\n1. Case counts greater than 0 and less than 10 are dropped - these will be null (blank) values\n2. Death counts greater than 0 and less than 10 are dropped - these will be null (blank) values\n3. Cases and deaths dropped altogether for areas where acs_population < 1000\n\n<em>Rate suppression in effect where counts lower than 20</em>\nRates are not calculated unless the case count is greater than or equal to 20. Rates are generally unstable at small numbers, so we avoid calculating them directly. We advise you to apply the same approach as this is best practice in epidemiology.\n\n<em>A note on Census ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)</em>\nZIP Code Tabulation Areas are special boundaries created by the U.S. Census based on ZIP Codes developed by the USPS. They are not, however, the same thing. ZCTAs are areal representations of routes. <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html\">Read how the Census develops ZCTAs on their website</a>.\n\n<em>Row included for Citywide case counts, incidence rate, and deaths</em>\nA single row is included that has the Cit", "attribution": "Department of Public Health - Population Health Division", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-09-11T19:38:16.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-05-29T19:20:59.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-09-11T19:38:16.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-09-11T12:07:46.000Z", "columns_name": ["data_loaded_at", "rate", "count", "deaths", "id", "area_type", "acs_population", "data_as_of", "max_specimen_collection_date", "multipolygon", "count_last_60_days"], "columns_field_name": ["data_loaded_at", "rate", "count", "deaths", "id", "area_type", "acs_population", "data_as_of", "max_specimen_collection_date", "multipolygon", "count_last_60_days"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Calendar date", "Calendar date", "MultiPolygon", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Timestamp when the record (row) was most recently updated here in the Open Data Portal", "The rate of cases in the area, calculated as (count/acs_population) * 10000 which is a rate per 10,000 residents", "The count of cases in the area, null when not zero and less than 10", "Number of deaths, null when not zero and less than 10", "The identifier for the area type", "Type of geographic area, one of: Citywide, Census Tract, Analysis Neighborhood, or ZCTA (ZIP Code Tabulation Area)", "2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) population estimate for a given geographic region ", "When the dataset was last compiled by scripts, representing how current the data is", "The most recent date through which data is populated for the dataset.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset is a cleaned and anonymized version of survey data gathered in FY23 from nonprofits who contract with the City and County of San Francisco. Each row is one organization and data includes general information about the nonprofit's services, finances, and operations, and summary demographic data about each nonprofit's workforce. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis dataset was generated through conducting a two-tiered survey gathering data on organizational characteristics and position-level data from nonprofits who contract with the City and County of San Francisco in FY23. The survey was fielded in October and November of 2022. 152 nonprofits provided organizational-level data and summary data about their workforce. 29 of those organizations (referred to as \"Cohort Organizations\") provided additional position-level data. This dataset includes organization-level data for the 152 respondent organizations. For further details on survey methodology, please review page 39 of the Nonprofit Wage and Equity Survey report, linked below in \"Related Reports.\"\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nData is a one-time survey and will not update.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nReview code book, attached in the \"About this Dataset\" section. \n\n<strong>E.

{"resource": {"name": "Traffic Crashes Resulting in Injury", "id": "ubvf-ztfx", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis table contains all crashes resulting in an injury in the City of San Francisco. Fatality year-to-date crash data is obtained from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OME) death records, and only includes those cases that meet the San Francisco Vision Zero Fatality Protocol maintained by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH), San Francisco Police Department (SFPD), and San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). Injury crash data is obtained from SFPD\u2019s Interim Collision System for 2018 through the current year-to-date, Crossroads Software Traffic Collision Database (CR) for years 2013-2017 and the Statewide Integrated Transportation Record System (SWITRS) maintained by the California Highway Patrol for all years prior to 2013. Only crashes with valid geographic information are mapped. All geocodable crash data is represented on the simplified San Francisco street centerline model maintained by the Department of Public Works (SFDPW). Collision injury data is queried and aggregated on a quarterly basis. Crashes occurring at complex intersections with multiple roadways are mapped onto a single point and injury and fatality crashes occurring on highways are excluded.\n\nThe crash, party, and victim tables have a relational structure. The traffic crashes table contains information on each crash, one record per crash. The party table contains information from all parties involved in the crashes, one record per party. Parties are individuals involved in a traffic crash including drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and parked vehicles. The victim table contains information about each party injured in the collision, including any passengers. Injury severity is included in the victim table. \n\nFor example, a crash occurs (1 record in the crash table) that involves a driver party and a pedestrian party (2 records in the party table). Only the pedestrian is injured and thus is the only victim (1 record in the victim table). \n\nTo learn more about the traffic injury datasets, see the <u><a href=\"https://tims.berkeley.edu/help/SWITRS.php\">TIMS documentation</a></u>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nTraffic crash injury data is collected from the California Highway Patrol 555 Crash Report as submitted by the police officer within 30 days after the crash occurred. All fields that match the SWITRS data schema are programmatically extracted, de-identified, geocoded, and loaded into TransBASE. See Section D below for details regarding TransBASE. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nAfter review by SFPD and SFDPH staff, the data is made publicly available approximately a month after the end of the previous quarter (May for Q1, August for Q2, November for Q3, and February for Q4). \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis data is being provided as public information as defined under San Francisco and California public records laws. SFDPH, SFMTA, and SFPD cannot limit or restrict the use of this data or its interpretation by other parties in any way. Where the data is communicated, distributed, reproduced, mapped, or used in any other way, the user should acknowledge TransBASE.sfgov.org as the source of the data, provide a reference to the original data source where also applicable, include the date the data was pulled, and note any caveats specified in the associated metadata documentation provided. However, users should not attribute their analysis or interpretation of this data to the City of San Francisco. While the data has been collected and/or produced for the use of the City of San Francisco, it cannot guarantee its accuracy or completeness. Accordingly, the City of San Francisco, including SFDPH, SFMTA, and SFPD make no representation as to the accuracy of the information or its suitability for any purpose and disclaim any liability for omissions or errors that may be contained therein.

{"resource": {"name": "Mpox Cases Over Time", "id": "vi7r-brsi", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset represents probable or confirmed mpox cases among San Francisco residents. Cases are included by the episode date, defined as either the date when self-reported symptoms began or, if that date is not available, the date the positive test was collected (i.e., specimen collection date). \n\nData are lagged by 5 days, meaning that the most recent date of self-reported symptom or specimen collection included is 1 day prior to today. All data update daily as more information becomes available. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCase information is based on confirmed or probable positive laboratory tests reported to the San Francisco Department of Public Health. Processes to provide quality assurance and other data verification are completed before the data are reported. \n\nThis data may not be immediately available for recently reported cases because of the time needed to process tests and validate cases. \n\nData are continually updated to maximize completeness of information and reporting on San Francisco residents with confirmed or probable mpox.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates to the data are made through automated and manual processes once each day, Monday through Friday.  \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset shows new cases and cumulative cases (probable and confirmed) by episode date. Episode date is the date of self-reported symptom onset, or, if not available, date of specimen collection (i.e., the date the person was tested). \n\nNew cases are the count of cases with a symptom onset or specimen collection date on the given episode date. Cumulative cases are the running total of all San Francisco cases through the episode date listed.\n\n<strong>D.

The Plant Finder recommends appropriate habitat-building plants for sidewalks, gardens and roofs that are adapted to San Francisco's unique environment and climate.\r\n\r\nThe plants in the database include California natives and Mediterranean climate exotics. A large subset of the California natives are actually local San Francisco natives. We strongly recommend local natives since they provide the best habitat for local pollinators and other wildlife with whom they have co-evolved. San Francisco natives are the most closely adapted to the climate and environment of the San Francisco peninsula of course, and so they are the best in terms of water and soil conservation, ecosystem health, and overall sustainability.\r\n\r\nYou can get the geographic ares for plant communities represented in this dataset here: https://data.sfgov.org/d/27u4-a5b3", "attribution": "Cit and County of San Francisco Planning Department", "attribution_link": "http://sfplantfinder.org", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-09-06T00:44:44.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-06-28T17:25:11.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-09-06T00:44:44.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-06-28T17:25:33.000Z", "columns_name": ["Street_Tree_List", "Size_at_Maturity", "Plant_Communities", "Associated_Wildlife", "Additional_Characteristices_Notes", "PhotoCredit02", "PhotoCredit04", "Common_Name", "Appropriate_Location", "Stormwater_Benefit", "Sandy_Soil", "Shady_Clay_int", "Shady_Clay", "Super60_int", "Sidewalk_Landscaping_Plants_int", "Habitat", "Special_List", "Nurseries", "Stormwater_int", "Pruning_Needs", "Climate_Appropriate_Plants", "Former_Latin_Name", "Top20", "Water_Needs", "Top20_int", "Super60", "Sandy_Soil_int", "Thrifty150", "Suitable_Site_Conditions", "Soil_Type", "Sidewalk_Landscaping_Plants", "Habitat_Value", "Latin_Name", "Family_Name", "Plant_Type", "Bloom_Time", "Flower_Color", "Thrifty150_int", "Habitat_int", "Additional_Species_Cultivars_Varieties", "PhotoCredit03", "PhotoCredit01", "Suggested_Green_Connection_Routes"], "columns_field_name": ["street_tree_list", "size_at_maturity", "plant_communities", "associated_wildlife", "additional_characteristices_notes", "photocredit02", "photocredit04", "common_name", "appropriate_location", "stormwater_benefit", "sandy_soil", "shady_clay_int", "shady_clay", "super60_int", "sidewalk_landscaping_plants_int", "habitat", "special_list", "nurseries", "stormwater_int", "pruning_needs", "climate_appropriate_plants", "former_latin_name", "top20", "water_needs", "top20_int", "super60", "sandy_soil_int", "thrifty150", "suitable_site_conditions", "soil_type", "sidewalk_landscaping_plants", "habitat_value", "latin_name", "family_name", "plant_type", "bloom_time", "flower_color", "thrifty150_int", "habitat_int", "additional_species_cultivars_varieties", "photocredit03", "photocredit01", "suggested_green_connection_routes"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-06-28T17:31:59.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Energy and Environment", "domain_tags": ["environment", "green connections", "planning", "plant", "plantfinder", "plants", "sf plant finder"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Department-Metrics_Publishing-Department", "value": "Environment"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Publishing-frequency", "value": "Annually"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Data-change-frequency", "value": "Annually"}, {"key": "Detailed-Descriptive_Geographic-unit", "value": "Not applicable"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.sfgov.org", "license": "Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License"}, "permalink": "https://data.sfgov.org/d/vmnk-skih", "link": "https://data.sfgov.org/Energy-and-Environment/San-Francisco-Plant-Finder-Data/vmnk-skih", "owner": {"id": "wh9h-jktj", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "mikewynne"}, "creator": {"id": "wh9h-jktj", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "mikewynne"}}

A pedestrian safety zone is a painted buffered curb-side space between the sidewalk and moving vehicles. Their footprint resembles a bulb out, helping to emphasize that the space should not be treated as part of the roadway. As a low-cost, easily-implemented treatment, painted safety zones enhance pedestrian safety by (1) Improving line of sight between pedestrians and motorists and (2) Providing motorists with visual cues that encourage careful maneuvering near pedestrians. Painted safety zones do not extend the sidewalk, as pedestrians still wait to start their crossing at the existing curb line. However, their future conversion to concrete bulbouts will provide all the benefits of a wider sidewalk.\n\nB.

SUMMARY</strong>\nStreetSmARTS is a Department of Public Works (DPW) graffiti abatement program, administered through the San Francisco Arts Commission (SFAC). The program connects artists with private property owners to create murals on their buildings, enhancing the character of the property and surrounding neighborhood, while deterring ongoing vandalism.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nIn 2017, an inventory was compiled manually by staff and it has been updated with each new mural created since.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nDataset updated as needed manually by staff.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThe majority of murals have street addresses but a few have street intersections instead. The address is the building location but the mural may be on the side of the building or around the corner. The data column \"number_of_districts\" refers to how many Cultural Districts a mural is in. If a mural is in more than Cultural Districts, the districts will be listed in the \"Cultural_District\" column and separated by a semicolon.

SUMMARY</strong>\nGeographic zones of the priority areas in the Tenderloin neighborhood used in the COVID-19 assessment and Tenderloin Neighborhood Plan. See more details on the plan here:\nhttps://sf.gov/news/san-francisco-releases-tenderloin-neighborhood-safety-assessment-and-plan-covid-19\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nA team of representative City departments from the Healthy Streets Operation Center (Department of Emergency Management, Department of Public Health, Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing, Human Rights Commission, San Francisco Police Department, San Francisco Fire Department, and Department of Public Works), SF Homeless Outreach Team, Felton Institute, and community groups and stakeholders was assembled to design and implement a robust Tenderloin Neighborhood Needs Assessment. This assessment was conducted on the morning of April 28, 2020 and consisted of multi-disciplinary teams walking each block of an area of the Tenderloin broken into six geographic zones. These zone locations are shown in the plan, and are mapped in this dataset.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThis is a reference map that will not be updated.\n\n<strong>D.

{"resource": {"name": "Dataset inventory", "id": "y8fp-fbf5", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThe dataset inventory provides a list of data maintained by departments that are candidates for open data publishing or have already been published and is collected in accordance with Chapter 22D of the Administrative Code. The inventory will be used in conjunction with department publishing plans to track progress toward meeting plan goals for each department. Department publishing plans are available at https://datasf.org/publishing/plans\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis dataset is collated through 2 ways:\n1. Ongoing updates are made throughout the year to reflect new datasets, this process involves DataSF staff reconciling publishing records after datasets are published\n2. Annual bulk updates - departments review their inventories and identify changes and updates and submit those to DataSF for a once a year bulk update - not all departments will have changes or their changes will have been captured over the course of the prior year already as ongoing updates\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe dataset is synced automatically daily, but the underlying data changes manually throughout the year as needed\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\n<em>Interpreting dates in this dataset</em>\nThis dataset has 3 dates:\n1. Date Added - when the dataset was added to the inventory itself\n2. First Published - when the dataset was initially published on the platform\n3. Date Created on Platform - the open data portal automatically captures the date the dataset was first created, this is that system generated date\n\nNote that in certain cases we may have published a dataset prior to it being added to the inventory. We do our best to have an accurate accounting of when something was added to this inventory and when it was published. In most cases the inventory addition will happen prior to publishing, but in certain cases it will be published and we will have missed updating the inventory as this is a manual process. \n\nFirst published will give an  accounting of when it was actually available on the open data catalog and date added when it was added to this list. \n\nDate Created on Platform will show when a dataset was initially created. Because datasets are created and re-created as underlying systems changed, this date can be after the first published date if, for example, there was a new dataset published as an improvement over a previous one. Additionally, for new datasets, this date is often prior to the first published date as it is created, reviewed, QA'd and prepared for release.\n\n<em>Companion systems inventory dataset</em>\nThis is a list of datasets published and unpublished, a companion <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Inventory-of-citywide-enterprise-systems-of-record/ebux-gcnq\">dataset of citywide enterprise systems of record can be accessed online</a> as well.", "attribution": "GSA - City Administrator's Office: DataSF", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-09-17T07:34:25.000Z", "createdAt": "2015-03-26T18:22:56.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-08-17T22:38:03.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-09-17T07:34:25.000Z", "columns_name": ["Publishing Status", "Automated By", "Dataset Link", "Department Priority", "Date Added", "Value", "Dataset Description", "Category", "Department or Division", "Data Classification", "First Published", "Dataset ID", "Date Created on Platform", "Inventory ID", "Dataset Name", "Publishing Approach"], "columns_field_name": ["publishing_status", "automated_by", "dataset_link", "department_priority", "date_added", "value", "dataset_description", "category", "department_or_division", "data_classification", "first_published", "dataset_id", "date_created_on_platform", "inventory_id", "dataset_name", "publishing_approach"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "URL", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["The publishing status of the dataset.

Exception: if the data is historical (or won't require updating) and easy to publish, consider adding it to your Priority 2 group. \n\nPriority 4 - These datasets do not need to be scheduled until the rest of the datasets are scheduled in the publication plan.

SUMMARY</strong>\nSnapshot of San Francisco's Development Pipeline. Tracking of construction and entitlement activity based on data from Department of Building Inspection's Permit Tracking System and the Planning Department's Project & Permit Tracking System, processed quarterly. For more information please see http://sfplanning.org/pipeline-report\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe dataset is created by combining projects data from the City Planning Department and permit data from the Building Inspection Department to create a quarterly snapshot that shows when a project is filed to construction.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe Development Pipeline is updated as a quarterly snapshot of the construction development in the City of San Francisco.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nEach row or record is a project or permit. They are fitted with information such as address, block lot, project case number and spatial data that allow users to find the specific project. Each row also contains project specific information such as project description and details to illustrate the scope of the project.\n\n<strong>E. DATA NOTES </strong>\n\n<strong>Reporting Update</strong>\nSignificant data and systems improvements are underway to produce a more accurate quarterly pipeline, so the data may change at any time. Weekly and monthly data on Planning Applications and Building Permits can be accessed via the City's Open Data Portal.\n\n<strong>Change in Status Definitions</strong>\nThe following changes have been made in status definitions since the 2022 Q1 Pipeline Report to align the Quarterly Pipeline Reports with other Housing Reports (Housing Inventory and Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) Annual Progress)  <br>\n<strong> (1) Construction: </strong> projects that are authorized for construction deemed to be in the construction stage. A project is considered to be authorized for construction if it has:\no\tan issued full building permit, OR<br>\no\tan issued site permit with an approved first construction document<br>\nPast definition: projects that had their first inspection were deemed to be in the construction stage.<br>\n<strong> (2) Building Permit Issued: </strong> includes projects that have an issued site permit but don\u2019t yet have their first construction document. Housing units for these projects are not yet counted toward RHNA progress.<br>\nPast definition: included projects with any type of permit (site or full building permit) in the issued status.\n\nA data dictionary can be downloaded from the following link: \nhttps://sfplanninggis.s3.amazonaws.com/PipelineDataDictionary_10262022.xlsx", "attribution": "City and County of San Francisco, City Planning Department", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-12-22T00:56:01.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-12-13T21:27:46.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-12-22T00:56:01.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-12-13T21:35:39.000Z", "columns_name": ["HEIGHT_BUL", "MED_EXIST", "MEDNET", "MIPS", "MIPSNET", "PDR_EXIST", "CIENET", "CIE", "NET_GSF", "TOTAL_GSF", "PDR", "DBIDESC", "DESCRIPT", "PDRNET", "RET_EXIST", "RET", "RETNET", "VISIT_EXIST", "VISIT", "VISITNET", "PLANNER", "SPONSOR", "CONTACT", "CONTACTPH", "DA", "PD", "NHOOD_37", "BPAPPLNO", "CASENO", "TENURE_TYPE", "AFF_TARGET", "Aff_Projection", "AFFORDABLENET", "Pipeline_Units", "UNITSNET", "TCOCFC_UNITS", "TCOCFC_DATE", "Longitude", "HOTEL_ROOM_NET", "PLANS", "ADU", "BESTDATE", "SUD", "Entitled", "Lat/Long", "QTR", "SECTION415", "MIPS_EXIST", "NAMEADDR", "BLKLOT", "ObjectID", "LEGALIZATION", "Analysis Neighborhoods", "HOTEL_ROOM_EXIST", "Current Supervisor Districts", "SD22", "State Density ALL", "BESTSTAT", "Current Police Districts", "NHOOD_41", "ZONING", "UNITS", "PDA", "YEAR", "LANDUSE", "Latitude", "HOTEL_ROOM_PROP", "CIE_EXIST", "YEAR_QTR", "MED", "SF Find Neighborhoods", "Neighborhoods"], "columns_field_name": ["height_bul", "med_exist", "mednet", "mips", "mipsnet", "pdr_exist", "cienet", "cie", "net_gsf", "total_gsf", "pdr", "dbidesc", "descript", "pdrnet", "ret_exist", "ret", "retnet", "visit_exist", "visit", "visitnet", "planner", "sponsor", "contact", "contactph", "da", "pd", "nhood_37", "bpapplno", "caseno", "tenure_type", "aff_target", "aff_projection", "affordablenet", "pipeline_units", "unitsnet", "tcocfc_units", "tcocfc_date", "longitude", "hotel_room_net", "plans", "adu", "bestdate", "sud", "entitled", "lat_long", "qtr", "section415", "mips_exist", "nameaddr", "blklot", "objectid", "legalization", ":@computed_region_ajp5_b2md", "hotel_room_exist", ":@computed_region_26cr_cadq", "sd22", "state_density_all", "beststat", ":@computed_region_qgnn_b9vv", "nhood_41", "zoning", "units", "pda", "year", "landuse", "latitude", "hotel_room_prop", "cie_exist", "year_qtr", "med", ":@computed_region_6qbp_sg9q", ":@computed_region_jwn9_ihcz"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Checkbox", "Calendar date", "Text", "Checkbox", "Point", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Checkbox", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "This column was automatically created in order to record in what polygon from the dataset 'Analysis Neighborhoods' (ajp5-b2md) the point in column 'lat_long' is located.

SUMMARY</strong>\n\n<strong><i>Please note that the \"Data Last Updated\" date on this page denotes the most recent DataSF update and does not reflect the most recent update to this dataset. To confirm the completeness of this dataset please contact the District Attorney's office at <u><a href=\u201dmailto:districtattorney@sfgov.org\u201d>districtattorney@sfgov.org</a></u>.</strong></i>\n\nThis data set includes all criminal cases prosecuted by the District Attorney\u2019s Office that have reached a final resolution, or disposition. A case is resolved when a final determination has been made in court (i.e., an acquittal, conviction, dismissal, or a judge finds a defendant has successfully completed diversion).\n\nA case may also be resolved through other means. For example, a case may be re-indicted, a defendant may be released to another agency's custody, etc. Because of the case tracking systems used in the San Francisco Superior Court, these cases are assigned new court numbers and thus show up as distinct cases in the data available to the District Attorney\u2019s Office. Lastly, sometimes a defendant will have multiple criminal cases related to the same incident or similar types of crimes. The defendant may plead guilty to one case, and in exchange, the other cases will be dropped. The San Francisco Superior Court codes these cases as \"1385 PC - Guilty Plea to Other Charge\".\n\nMore information about this dataset can be found under the \u201cCase Resolutions\u201d section on the <u><a href=\"https://sfdistrictattorney.org/policy/data-dashboards/#case-resolutions\">Data Dashboards page</a></u>\n\n<strong><i>Disclaimer: The San Francisco District Attorney's Office does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information as the data is subject to change as modifications and updates are completed.</strong></i>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\n\nWhen a case prosecuted by the District Attorney\u2019s Office reaches a final resolution, or disposition, relevant data is manually entered into the District Attorney Office's case management system. Data reports are pulled from this system on a semi-regular basis, cleaned, anonymized, and added to Open Data.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\n\nWe strive to update this dataset at the beginning of every week. However, the creation of this dataset requires a manual pull from the Office's case management system and is dependent on staff availability.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\n\nPlease review the \u201cCase Resolutions\u201d section on the <u><a href=\"https://sfdistrictattorney.org/policy/data-dashboards/#case-resolutions\">Data Dashboards page</a></u> for more information about this dataset.\n\n<strong>E.

Tracking of construction and entitlement activity based on data from Department of Building Inspection's Permit Tracking System and the Planning Department's Project & Permit Tracking System, processed quarterly. For more information please see http://sfplanning.org/pipeline-report\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe dataset is created by combining projects data from the City Planning Department and permit data from the Building Inspection Department to create a quarterly snapshot that shows when a project is filed to construction.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe Development Pipeline is updated as a quarterly snapshot of the construction development in the City of San Francisco.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nEach row or record is a project or permit. They are fitted with information such as address, block lot, project case number and spatial data that allow users to find the specific project. Each row also contains project specific information such as project description and details to illustrate the scope of the project.\n\n<strong>E. DATA NOTES </strong>\n\n<strong>Reporting Update</strong>\nSignificant data and systems improvements are underway to produce a more accurate quarterly pipeline, so the data may change at any time. Weekly and monthly data on Planning Applications and Building Permits can be accessed via the City's Open Data Portal.\n\n<strong>Change in Status Definitions</strong>\nThe following changes have been made in status definitions since the 2022 Q1 Pipeline Report to align the Quarterly Pipeline Reports with other Housing Reports (Housing Inventory and Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) Annual Progress)  <br>\n<strong> (1) Construction: </strong> projects that are authorized for construction deemed to be in the construction stage. A project is considered to be authorized for construction if it has:\no\tan issued full building permit, OR<br>\no\tan issued site permit with an approved first construction document<br>\nPast definition: projects that had their first inspection were deemed to be in the construction stage.<br>\n<strong> (2) Building Permit Issued: </strong> includes projects that have an issued site permit but don\u2019t yet have their first construction document. Housing units for these projects are not yet counted toward RHNA progress.<br>\nPast definition: included projects with any type of permit (site or full building permit) in the issued status.\n\nA data dictionary can be downloaded from the following link: \nhttps://sfplanninggis.s3.amazonaws.com/PipelineDataDictionary_10262022.xlsx", "attribution": "City and County of San Francisco, City Planning Department", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-12-01T02:41:39.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-12-01T02:26:46.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-12-01T02:41:39.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-12-01T02:41:27.000Z", "columns_name": ["TENURE_TYPE", "Lat/Long", "YEAR_QTR", "QTR", "YEAR", "Latitude", "Longitude", "PLANS", "SUD", "PDA", "HEIGHT_BUL", "ZONING", "NHOOD_41", "NHOOD_37", "SD22", "PD", "ADU", "LEGALIZATION", "DA", "CONTACTPH", "CONTACT", "SPONSOR", "PLANNER", "HOTEL_ROOM_NET", "HOTEL_ROOM_PROP", "HOTEL_ROOM_EXIST", "VISITNET", "VISIT", "VISIT_EXIST", "RETNET", "RET", "RET_EXIST", "PDRNET", "PDR", "PDR_EXIST", "MIPSNET", "MIPS", "MIPS_EXIST", "MEDNET", "MED", "MED_EXIST", "CIENET", "CIE", "CIE_EXIST", "NET_GSF", "TOTAL_GSF", "DBIDESC", "DESCRIPT", "BPAPPLNO", "CASENO", "AFF_TARGET", "SECTION415", "Aff_Projection", "AFFORDABLENET", "Pipeline_Units", "UNITSNET", "TCOCFC_UNITS", "TCOCFC_DATE", "UNITS", "BESTDATE", "BESTSTAT", "Entitled", "NAMEADDR", "BLKLOT", "LANDUSE", "ObjectID", "Analysis Neighborhoods", "Current Supervisor Districts", "Current Police Districts", "SF Find Neighborhoods", "Neighborhoods", "State Density ALL"], "columns_field_name": ["tenure_type", "lat_long", "year_qtr", "qtr", "year", "latitude", "longitude", "plans", "sud", "pda", "height_bul", "zoning", "nhood_41", "nhood_37", "sd22", "pd", "adu", "legalization", "da", "contactph", "contact", "sponsor", "planner", "hotel_room_net", "hotel_room_prop", "hotel_room_exist", "visitnet", "visit", "visit_exist", "retnet", "ret", "ret_exist", "pdrnet", "pdr", "pdr_exist", "mipsnet", "mips", "mips_exist", "mednet", "med", "med_exist", "cienet", "cie", "cie_exist", "net_gsf", "total_gsf", "dbidesc", "descript", "bpapplno", "caseno", "aff_target", "section415", "aff_projection", "affordablenet", "pipeline_units", "unitsnet", "tcocfc_units", "tcocfc_date", "units", "bestdate", "beststat", "entitled", "nameaddr", "blklot", "landuse", "objectid", ":@computed_region_ajp5_b2md", ":@computed_region_26cr_cadq", ":@computed_region_qgnn_b9vv", ":@computed_region_6qbp_sg9q", ":@computed_region_jwn9_ihcz", "state_density_all"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Point", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Checkbox", "Checkbox", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Text", "Checkbox", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "This column was automatically created in order to record in what polygon from the dataset 'Analysis Neighborhoods' (ajp5-b2md) the point in column 'lat_long' is located.
