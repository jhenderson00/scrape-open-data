{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Testing Over Time", "id": "nfpa-mg4g", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>Note: On 1/31/2023 we made the following changes: \n<UL><LI>Renamed the column \"last_updated_at\" to \"data_as_of\"\n<LI>Added the following columns: \n<UL><LI>\"cumulative_tests\"\n<LI>\"cumulative_positive_tests\"\n<LI>\"cumulative_negative_tests\"\n<LI>\"cumulative_indeterminate_tests\"</UL></UL></strong> \n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nCase information on COVID-19 Laboratory testing. This data includes a daily count of test results reported, and how many of those were positive, negative, and indeterminate. Reported tests include tests with a positive, negative or indeterminate result. Indeterminate results, which could not conclusively determine whether COVID-19 virus was present, are not included in the calculation of percent positive. Testing for the novel coronavirus is available through commercial, clinical, and hospital laboratories, as well as the SFDPH Public Health Laboratory.\n\nTests are de-duplicated by an individual and date. This means that if a person gets tested multiple times on different dates in the last 30 days, all of those individual tests will be included in this data as individual tests (on each specimen collection date).\n\n<strong>Total positive test results is not equal to the total number of COVID-19 cases in San Francisco.</strong> Each positive test result is investigated. During this investigation, some test results are found to be for persons living outside of San Francisco and some are duplicates of previously received positive results. These are not included in the total San Francisco COVID-19 case count. Additionally, investigation of positive test results might not be completed on the day of receipt; new cases will be added to the total case count after full investigation and verification. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nLaboratory test volume and positivity for COVID-19 is based on electronic laboratory test reports. Deduplication, quality assurance measures and other data verification processes maximize accuracy of laboratory test information.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nDue to the high degree of variation in the time needed to complete tests by different labs there is a delay in this reporting. On March 24 the Health Officer ordered all labs in the City to report complete COVID-19 testing information to the local and state health departments. In order to track trends over time, a data user can analyze this data by \"result_date\" and see how the count of reported results and positivity rate have changed over time.\n\n<strong>E.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Cases and Deaths Summarized by Geography", "id": "tpyr-dvnc", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>Note: On 2/21/2023 system updates to improve reliability and accuracy of cases data were implemented.</strong>\n\n<strong>Note: On 1/31/2023 we updated our data to reflect the 2020 Census Bureau American Community Survey (ACS) San Francisco Population estimates.</strong>\n\n<strong>Note: On 1/31/2023 we implemented system updates to streamline and improve our geo-coded data, resulting in small shifts in our case and death data by geography.</strong> \n\n<strong>Note: On 1/31/2023 we renamed the column \"last_updated_at\" to \"data_as_of\".</strong> \n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nMedical provider confirmed COVID-19 cases and confirmed COVID-19 related deaths in San Francisco, CA aggregated by several different geographic areas and normalized by 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates for population data to calculate rate per 10,000 residents.\n\nOn September 12, 2021, a new case definition of COVID-19 was introduced that includes criteria for enumerating new infections after previous probable or confirmed infections (also known as reinfections). A reinfection is defined as a confirmed positive PCR lab test more than 90 days after a positive PCR or antigen test. The first reinfection case was identified on December 7, 2021.\n\nCases and deaths are both mapped to the residence of the individual, not to where they were infected or died. For example, if one was infected in San Francisco at work but lives in the East Bay, those are not counted as SF Cases or if one dies in Zuckerberg San Francisco General but is from another county, that is also not counted in this dataset.\n\nDataset is cumulative and covers cases going back to 3/2/2020 when testing began. \n\nGeographic areas summarized are:\n1. <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Analysis-Neighborhoods-2020-census-tracts-assigned/sevw-6tgi\">Analysis Neighborhoods</a>\n2. <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Census-2020-Tracts-for-San-Francisco/tmph-tgz9\">Census Tracts</a>\n3. <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html\">Census Zip Code Tabulation Areas</a>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nAddresses from medical data are geocoded by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). Those addresses are spatially joined to the geographic areas. Counts are generated based on the number of address points that match each geographic area. The 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) population estimates provided by the Census are used to create a rate which is equal to <i>([count] / [acs_population]) * 10000)</i> representing the number of cases per 10,000 residents.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nGeographic analysis is scripted by SFDPH staff and synced to this dataset daily at 7:30 Pacific Time. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nSan Francisco population estimates for geographic regions can be found in a <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/35v5-seg9\">view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset</a>. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS).\n\n<em>Privacy rules in effect</em>\nTo protect privacy, certain rules are in effect:\n1. Case counts greater than 0 and less than 10 are dropped - these will be null (blank) values\n2. Death counts greater than 0 and less than 10 are dropped - these will be null (blank) values\n3. Cases and deaths dropped altogether for areas where acs_population < 1000\n\n<em>Rate suppression in effect where counts lower than 20</em>\nRates are not calculated unless the case count is greater than or equal to 20. Rates are generally unstable at small numbers, so we avoid calculating them directly. We advise you to apply the same approach as this is best practice in epidemiology.\n\n<em>A note on Census ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)</em>\nZIP Code Tabulation Areas are special boundaries created by the U.S. Census based on ZIP Codes developed by the USP", "attribution": "Department of Public Health - Population Health Division", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-02-25T13:05:44.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-05-29T19:20:59.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-02-25T13:05:40.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-25T13:05:44.000Z", "columns_name": ["id", "count_last_60_days", "data_loaded_at", "area_type", "max_specimen_collection_date", "deaths", "multipolygon", "count", "acs_population", "rate", "data_as_of"], "columns_field_name": ["id", "count_last_60_days", "data_loaded_at", "area_type", "max_specimen_collection_date", "deaths", "multipolygon", "count", "acs_population", "rate", "data_as_of"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Calendar date", "Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "MultiPolygon", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date"], "columns_description": ["The identifier for the area type", "The count of cases in the area between max_specimen_collection_date and 60 days prior, null when total count is not zero and less than 10", "Timestamp when the record (row) was most recently updated here in the Open Data Portal", "Type of geographic area, one of: Citywide, Census Tract, Analysis Neighborhood, or ZCTA (ZIP Code Tabulation Area)", "The most recent date through which data is populated for the dataset.

{"resource": {"name": "Traffic Crashes Resulting in Injury", "id": "ubvf-ztfx", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis table contains all crashes resulting in an injury in the City of San Francisco. Fatality year-to-date crash data is obtained from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OME) death records, and only includes those cases that meet the San Francisco Vision Zero Fatality Protocol maintained by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH), San Francisco Police Department (SFPD), and San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). Injury crash data is obtained from SFPD\u2019s Interim Collision System for 2018 through the current year-to-date, Crossroads Software Traffic Collision Database (CR) for years 2013-2017 and the Statewide Integrated Transportation Record System (SWITRS) maintained by the California Highway Patrol for all years prior to 2013. Only crashes with valid geographic information are mapped. All geocodable crash data is represented on the simplified San Francisco street centerline model maintained by the Department of Public Works (SFDPW). Collision injury data is queried and aggregated on a quarterly basis. Crashes occurring at complex intersections with multiple roadways are mapped onto a single point and injury and fatality crashes occurring on highways are excluded.\n\nThe crash, party, and victim tables have a relational structure. The traffic crashes table contains information on each crash, one record per crash. The party table contains information from all parties involved in the crashes, one record per party. Parties are individuals involved in a traffic crash including drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and parked vehicles. The victim table contains information about each party injured in the collision, including any passengers. Injury severity is included in the victim table. \n\nFor example, a crash occurs (1 record in the crash table) that involves a driver party and a pedestrian party (2 records in the party table). Only the pedestrian is injured and thus is the only victim (1 record in the victim table). \n\nTo learn more about the traffic injury datasets, see the <u><a href=\"https://tims.berkeley.edu/help/SWITRS.php\">TIMS documentation</a></u>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nTraffic crash injury data is collected from the California Highway Patrol 555 Crash Report as submitted by the police officer within 30 days after the crash occurred. All fields that match the SWITRS data schema are programmatically extracted, de-identified, geocoded, and loaded into TransBASE. See Section D below for details regarding TransBASE. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nAfter review by SFPD and SFDPH staff, the data is made publicly available approximately a month after the end of the previous quarter (May for Q1, August for Q2, November for Q3, and February for Q4). \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis data is being provided as public information as defined under San Francisco and California public records laws. SFDPH, SFMTA, and SFPD cannot limit or restrict the use of this data or its interpretation by other parties in any way. Where the data is communicated, distributed, reproduced, mapped, or used in any other way, the user should acknowledge TransBASE.sfgov.org as the source of the data, provide a reference to the original data source where also applicable, include the date the data was pulled, and note any caveats specified in the associated metadata documentation provided. However, users should not attribute their analysis or interpretation of this data to the City of San Francisco. While the data has been collected and/or produced for the use of the City of San Francisco, it cannot guarantee its accuracy or completeness. Accordingly, the City of San Francisco, including SFDPH, SFMTA, and SFPD make no representation as to the accuracy of the information or its suitability for any purpose and disclaim any liability for omissions or errors that may be contained therein.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset represents probable or confirmed mpox cases among San Francisco residents.

All data update daily as more information becomes available. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCase information is based on confirmed or probable positive laboratory tests reported to the San Francisco Department of Public Health. Processes to provide quality assurance and other data verification are completed before the data are reported. \n\nThis data may not be immediately available for recently reported cases because of the time needed to process tests and validate cases. \n\nData are continually updated to maximize completeness of information and reporting on San Francisco residents with confirmed or probable mpox.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates to the data are made through automated and manual processes once each day, Monday through Friday.  \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset shows new cases and cumulative cases (probable and confirmed) by episode date. Episode date is the date of self-reported symptom onset, or, if not available, date of specimen collection (i.e., the date the person was tested). \n\nNew cases are the count of cases with a symptom onset or specimen collection date on the given episode date.

The Plant Finder recommends appropriate habitat-building plants for sidewalks, gardens and roofs that are adapted to San Francisco's unique environment and climate.\r\n\r\nThe plants in the database include California natives and Mediterranean climate exotics. A large subset of the California natives are actually local San Francisco natives. We strongly recommend local natives since they provide the best habitat for local pollinators and other wildlife with whom they have co-evolved. San Francisco natives are the most closely adapted to the climate and environment of the San Francisco peninsula of course, and so they are the best in terms of water and soil conservation, ecosystem health, and overall sustainability.\r\n\r\nYou can get the geographic ares for plant communities represented in this dataset here: https://data.sfgov.org/d/27u4-a5b3", "attribution": "Cit and County of San Francisco Planning Department", "attribution_link": "http://sfplantfinder.org", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-09-06T00:44:44.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-06-28T17:25:11.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-09-06T00:44:44.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-06-28T17:25:33.000Z", "columns_name": ["Flower_Color", "Climate_Appropriate_Plants", "Nurseries", "Former_Latin_Name", "Suitable_Site_Conditions", "Soil_Type", "Habitat_Value", "Stormwater_Benefit", "Appropriate_Location", "Suggested_Green_Connection_Routes", "Street_Tree_List", "PhotoCredit01", "PhotoCredit03", "Additional_Species_Cultivars_Varieties", "Habitat_int", "Thrifty150_int", "Latin_Name", "Family_Name", "Plant_Type", "Bloom_Time", "Size_at_Maturity", "Plant_Communities", "Associated_Wildlife", "Additional_Characteristices_Notes", "PhotoCredit02", "PhotoCredit04", "Top20", "Water_Needs", "Top20_int", "Super60", "Special_List", "Sandy_Soil_int", "Thrifty150", "Sidewalk_Landscaping_Plants", "Habitat", "Pruning_Needs", "Sidewalk_Landscaping_Plants_int", "Stormwater_int", "Super60_int", "Shady_Clay", "Shady_Clay_int", "Sandy_Soil", "Common_Name"], "columns_field_name": ["flower_color", "climate_appropriate_plants", "nurseries", "former_latin_name", "suitable_site_conditions", "soil_type", "habitat_value", "stormwater_benefit", "appropriate_location", "suggested_green_connection_routes", "street_tree_list", "photocredit01", "photocredit03", "additional_species_cultivars_varieties", "habitat_int", "thrifty150_int", "latin_name", "family_name", "plant_type", "bloom_time", "size_at_maturity", "plant_communities", "associated_wildlife", "additional_characteristices_notes", "photocredit02", "photocredit04", "top20", "water_needs", "top20_int", "super60", "special_list", "sandy_soil_int", "thrifty150", "sidewalk_landscaping_plants", "habitat", "pruning_needs", "sidewalk_landscaping_plants_int", "stormwater_int", "super60_int", "shady_clay", "shady_clay_int", "sandy_soil", "common_name"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-06-28T17:31:59.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Energy and Environment", "domain_tags": ["environment", "green connections", "planning", "plant", "plantfinder", "plants", "sf plant finder"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Department-Metrics_Publishing-Department", "value": "Environment"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Publishing-frequency", "value": "Annually"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Data-change-frequency", "value": "Annually"}, {"key": "Detailed-Descriptive_Geographic-unit", "value": "Not applicable"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.sfgov.org", "license": "Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License"}, "permalink": "https://data.sfgov.org/d/vmnk-skih", "link": "https://data.sfgov.org/Energy-and-Environment/San-Francisco-Plant-Finder-Data/vmnk-skih", "owner": {"id": "wh9h-jktj", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "mikewynne"}, "creator": {"id": "wh9h-jktj", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "mikewynne"}}

A pedestrian safety zone is a painted buffered curb-side space between the sidewalk and moving vehicles. Their footprint resembles a bulb out, helping to emphasize that the space should not be treated as part of the roadway. As a low-cost, easily-implemented treatment, painted safety zones enhance pedestrian safety by (1) Improving line of sight between pedestrians and motorists and (2) Providing motorists with visual cues that encourage careful maneuvering near pedestrians. Painted safety zones do not extend the sidewalk, as pedestrians still wait to start their crossing at the existing curb line. However, their future conversion to concrete bulbouts will provide all the benefits of a wider sidewalk.\n\nB.

{"resource": {"name": "Dataset inventory", "id": "y8fp-fbf5", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>Annual Inventory Update Notice</strong>\nWe have updated the inventory with provisional update as of July 1, 2020 based on an initial cleanup and reconciliation of records. DataSF staff are delayed on a full update because of the ongoing COVID-19 response but are working with departments to complete that annual update by end of July.\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThe dataset inventory provides a list of data maintained by departments that are candidates for open data publishing or have already been published and is collected in accordance with Chapter 22D of the Administrative Code. The inventory will be used in conjunction with department publishing plans to track progress toward meeting plan goals for each department. Department publishing plans are available at https://datasf.org/publishing/plans\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis dataset is collated through 2 ways:\n1. Ongoing updates are made throughout the year to reflect new datasets, this process involves DataSF staff reconciling publishing records after datasets are published\n2. Annual bulk updates - departments review their inventories and identify changes and updates and submit those to DataSF for a once a year bulk update - not all departments will have changes or their changes will have been captured over the course of the prior year already as ongoing updates\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe dataset is synced automatically daily, but the underlying data changes manually throughout the year as needed\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\n<em>Interpreting dates in this dataset</em>\nThis dataset has 3 dates:\n1. Date Added - when the dataset was added to the inventory itself\n2. First Published - when the dataset was initially published on the platform\n3. Date Created on Platform - the open data portal automatically captures the date the dataset was first created, this is that system generated date\n\nNote that in certain cases we may have published a dataset prior to it being added to the inventory. We do our best to have an accurate accounting of when something was added to this inventory and when it was published. In most cases the inventory addition will happen prior to publishing, but in certain cases it will be published and we will have missed updating the inventory as this is a manual process. \n\nFirst published will give an  accounting of when it was actually available on the open data catalog and date added when it was added to this list. \n\nDate Created on Platform will show when a dataset was initially created. Because datasets are created and re-created as underlying systems changed, this date can be after the first published date if, for example, there was a new dataset published as an improvement over a previous one. Additionally, for new datasets, this date is often prior to the first published date as it is created, reviewed, QA'd and prepared for release.\n\n<em>Companion systems inventory dataset</em>\nThis is a list of datasets published and unpublished, a companion <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Inventory-of-citywide-enterprise-systems-of-record/ebux-gcnq\">dataset of citywide enterprise systems of record can be accessed online</a> as well.", "attribution": "GSA - City Administrator's Office: DataSF", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-02-25T07:34:07.000Z", "createdAt": "2015-03-26T18:22:56.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-07-01T17:15:04.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-25T07:34:07.000Z", "columns_name": ["Status Notes", "Date Created on Platform", "Inventory ID", "First Published", "Data Classification", "Department or Division", "Category", "Dataset Description", "Lag", "Automated By", "Value", "Lag Days", "On Time", "Natively Hosted", "Metadata Complete", "Dataset Link", "Dataset Name", "Publishing Status", "Required Fields Complete", "Data Dictionary or Equivalent", "Publishing Approach", "Department Priority", "Date Added", "Dataset ID"], "columns_field_name": ["status_notes", "date_created_on_platform", "inventory_id", "first_published", "data_classification", "department_or_division", "category", "dataset_description", "lag", "automated_by", "value", "lag_days", "on_time", "natively_hosted", "metadata_complete", "dataset_link", "dataset_name", "publishing_status", "required_fields_complete", "data_dictionary", "publishing_approach", "department_priority", "date_added", "dataset_id"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Checkbox", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Checkbox", "Checkbox", "URL", "Text", "Text", "Checkbox", "Checkbox", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Additional optional notes to clarify the publishing status where necessary.

SUMMARY</strong>\nSnapshot of San Francisco's Development Pipeline. Tracking of construction and entitlement activity based on data from Department of Building Inspection's Permit Tracking System and the Planning Department's Project & Permit Tracking System, processed quarterly. For more information please see http://sfplanning.org/pipeline-report\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe dataset is created by combining projects data from the City Planning Department and permit data from the Building Inspection Department to create a quarterly snapshot that shows when a project is filed to construction.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe Development Pipeline is updated as a quarterly snapshot of the construction development in the City of San Francisco.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nEach row or record is a project or permit. They are fitted with information such as address, block lot, project case number and spatial data that allow users to find the specific project. Each row also contains project specific information such as project description and details to illustrate the scope of the project.\n\n<strong>E. DATA NOTES </strong>\n\n<strong>Reporting Update</strong>\nSignificant data and systems improvements are underway to produce a more accurate quarterly pipeline, so the data may change at any time.

To confirm the completeness of this dataset please contact the District Attorney's office at <u><a href=\u201dmailto:districtattorney@sfgov.org\u201d>districtattorney@sfgov.org</a></u>.</strong></i>\n\nThis data set includes all criminal cases prosecuted by the District Attorney\u2019s Office that have reached a final resolution, or disposition. A case is resolved when a final determination has been made in court (i.e., an acquittal, conviction, dismissal, or a judge finds a defendant has successfully completed diversion).\n\nA case may also be resolved through other means. For example, a case may be re-indicted, a defendant may be released to another agency's custody, etc. Because of the case tracking systems used in the San Francisco Superior Court, these cases are assigned new court numbers and thus show up as distinct cases in the data available to the District Attorney\u2019s Office. Lastly, sometimes a defendant will have multiple criminal cases related to the same incident or similar types of crimes. The defendant may plead guilty to one case, and in exchange, the other cases will be dropped. The San Francisco Superior Court codes these cases as \"1385 PC - Guilty Plea to Other Charge\".\n\nMore information about this dataset can be found under the \u201cCase Resolutions\u201d section on the <u><a href=\"https://sfdistrictattorney.org/policy/data-dashboards/#case-resolutions\">Data Dashboards page</a></u>\n\n<strong><i>Disclaimer: The San Francisco District Attorney's Office does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information as the data is subject to change as modifications and updates are completed.</strong></i>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\n\nWhen a case prosecuted by the District Attorney\u2019s Office reaches a final resolution, or disposition, relevant data is manually entered into the District Attorney Office's case management system. Data reports are pulled from this system on a semi-regular basis, cleaned, anonymized, and added to Open Data.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\n\nWe strive to update this dataset at the beginning of every week. However, the creation of this dataset requires a manual pull from the Office's case management system and is dependent on staff availability.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\n\nPlease review the \u201cCase Resolutions\u201d section on the <u><a href=\"https://sfdistrictattorney.org/policy/data-dashboards/#case-resolutions\">Data Dashboards page</a></u> for more information about this dataset.\n\n<strong>E.

The centroid of each footprint was used to join a property identifier from a draft of the San Francisco Enterprise GIS Program's cartographic base, which provides continuous coverage with distinct right-of-way areas as well as selected nearby parcels from adjacent counties.

Tracking of construction and entitlement activity based on data from Department of Building Inspection's Permit Tracking System and the Planning Department's Project & Permit Tracking System, processed quarterly. For more information please see http://sfplanning.org/pipeline-report\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe dataset is created by combining projects data from the City Planning Department and permit data from the Building Inspection Department to create a quarterly snapshot that shows when a project is filed to construction.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe Development Pipeline is updated as a quarterly snapshot of the construction development in the City of San Francisco.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nEach row or record is a project or permit. They are fitted with information such as address, block lot, project case number and spatial data that allow users to find the specific project. Each row also contains project specific information such as project description and details to illustrate the scope of the project.\n\n<strong>E. DATA NOTES </strong>\n\n<strong>Reporting Update</strong>\nSignificant data and systems improvements are underway to produce a more accurate quarterly pipeline, so the data may change at any time. Weekly and monthly data on Planning Applications and Building Permits can be accessed via the City's Open Data Portal.\n\n<strong>Change in Status Definitions</strong>\nThe following changes have been made in status definitions since the 2022 Q1 Pipeline Report to align the Quarterly Pipeline Reports with other Housing Reports (Housing Inventory and Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) Annual Progress)  <br>\n<strong> (1) Construction: </strong> projects that are authorized for construction deemed to be in the construction stage. A project is considered to be authorized for construction if it has:\no\tan issued full building permit, OR<br>\no\tan issued site permit with an approved first construction document<br>\nPast definition: projects that had their first inspection were deemed to be in the construction stage.<br>\n<strong> (2) Building Permit Issued: </strong> includes projects that have an issued site permit but don\u2019t yet have their first construction document. Housing units for these projects are not yet counted toward RHNA progress.<br>\nPast definition: included projects with any type of permit (site or full building permit) in the issued status.\n\nA data dictionary can be downloaded from the following link: \nhttps://sfplanninggis.s3.amazonaws.com/PipelineDataDictionary_10262022.xlsx", "attribution": "City and County of San Francisco, City Planning Department", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-12-01T02:41:39.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-12-01T02:26:46.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-12-01T02:41:39.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-12-01T02:41:27.000Z", "columns_name": ["HOTEL_ROOM_NET", "Analysis Neighborhoods", "ObjectID", "LANDUSE", "BLKLOT", "NAMEADDR", "Entitled", "BESTSTAT", "BESTDATE", "UNITS", "TCOCFC_DATE", "TCOCFC_UNITS", "UNITSNET", "Pipeline_Units", "AFFORDABLENET", "Aff_Projection", "SECTION415", "AFF_TARGET", "TENURE_TYPE", "CASENO", "BPAPPLNO", "DESCRIPT", "DBIDESC", "TOTAL_GSF", "NET_GSF", "CIE_EXIST", "CIE", "CIENET", "MED_EXIST", "MED", "MEDNET", "MIPS_EXIST", "MIPS", "MIPSNET", "PDR_EXIST", "PDR", "PDRNET", "RET_EXIST", "RET", "RETNET", "VISIT_EXIST", "VISIT", "VISITNET", "HOTEL_ROOM_EXIST", "HOTEL_ROOM_PROP", "PLANNER", "Current Police Districts", "SPONSOR", "CONTACT", "CONTACTPH", "DA", "LEGALIZATION", "ADU", "PD", "SD22", "NHOOD_37", "NHOOD_41", "ZONING", "HEIGHT_BUL", "PDA", "SUD", "PLANS", "Longitude", "Latitude", "YEAR", "QTR", "YEAR_QTR", "SF Find Neighborhoods", "Lat/Long", "Neighborhoods", "State Density ALL", "Current Supervisor Districts"], "columns_field_name": ["hotel_room_net", ":@computed_region_ajp5_b2md", "objectid", "landuse", "blklot", "nameaddr", "entitled", "beststat", "bestdate", "units", "tcocfc_date", "tcocfc_units", "unitsnet", "pipeline_units", "affordablenet", "aff_projection", "section415", "aff_target", "tenure_type", "caseno", "bpapplno", "descript", "dbidesc", "total_gsf", "net_gsf", "cie_exist", "cie", "cienet", "med_exist", "med", "mednet", "mips_exist", "mips", "mipsnet", "pdr_exist", "pdr", "pdrnet", "ret_exist", "ret", "retnet", "visit_exist", "visit", "visitnet", "hotel_room_exist", "hotel_room_prop", "planner", ":@computed_region_qgnn_b9vv", "sponsor", "contact", "contactph", "da", "legalization", "adu", "pd", "sd22", "nhood_37", "nhood_41", "zoning", "height_bul", "pda", "sud", "plans", "longitude", "latitude", "year", "qtr", "year_qtr", ":@computed_region_6qbp_sg9q", "lat_long", ":@computed_region_jwn9_ihcz", "state_density_all", ":@computed_region_26cr_cadq"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Checkbox", "Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Checkbox", "Checkbox", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Point", "Number", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "This column was automatically created in order to record in what polygon from the dataset 'Analysis Neighborhoods' (ajp5-b2md) the point in column 'lat_long' is located.
