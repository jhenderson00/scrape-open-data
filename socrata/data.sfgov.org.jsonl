{"resource": {"name": "Building Permits", "id": "i98e-djp9", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThe dataset includes details of all building permit applications filed with the Department of Building Inspection. Permit numbers and associated information may be repeated in multiple rows if there are multiple addresses associated with the permit. To view the deduplicated building permits dataset with just the primary address, <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Housing-and-Buildings/Building-Permits-Deduplicated-on-Primary-Address/f2jc-ivnc\">click here</a></u>. Data is uploaded nightly by DBI. Users can view associated addenda, routing, and inspection information for each permit in the dataset online through DBI\u2019s Permit Tracking System <u><a href=\"https://dbiweb02.sfgov.org/dbipts/\">here</a></u>.\n\n<b> A full data dictionary for this dataset is available by <u><a href=\"https://datasf.gitbook.io/datasf-dataset-explainers/dbi-building-permits-and-permit-addenda-data/building-permits-data-dictionary\">clicking here.</a></u> </b>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe dataset is created by extracting permit characteristics and key dates (including permit filing, issuance, and completion dates) from DBI\u2019s Permit Tracking System.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe process that builds this dataset will run nightly and include all permits entered into the system up to the time of the refresh (see the \u201cdata as of\u201d column in the dataset).\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nUsers can use this dataset to search for all permits associated with a specific address or parcel number and view characteristics like addresses, permit descriptions of work, unit counts, valuations, etc. If the analytical objective is to measure permitting trends for all addresses, we recommend using the primary address building permits dataset.\n\n<b>Note:</b> if you need to open this dataset in Excel, use one of the pre-filtered datasets. Opening the main dataset in Excel will cause some data to be lost as there are more than one million rows in the full dataset.\n\n1. <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/p4e4-a5a7\">Building Permits filed on or after January 1, 2013</a></u>\n2. <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/4jpb-z4kk\">Building Permits filed before January 1, 2013</a></u> \n\n<strong>E.

This data includes a daily count of test results reported, and how many of those were positive, negative, and indeterminate. Reported tests include tests with a positive, negative or indeterminate result. Indeterminate results, which could not conclusively determine whether COVID-19 virus was present, are not included in the calculation of percent positive. Testing for the novel coronavirus is available through commercial, clinical, and hospital laboratories, as well as the SFDPH Public Health Laboratory.\n\nTests are de-duplicated by an individual and date. This means that if a person gets tested multiple times on different dates in the last 30 days, all of those individual tests will be included in this data as individual tests (on each specimen collection date).\n\n<strong>Total positive test results is not equal to the total number of COVID-19 cases in San Francisco.</strong>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nLaboratory test volume and positivity for COVID-19 is based on electronic laboratory test reports. Deduplication, quality assurance measures and other data verification processes maximize accuracy of laboratory test information.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nDue to the high degree of variation in the time needed to complete tests by different labs there is a delay in this reporting. On March 24 the Health Officer ordered all labs in the City to report complete COVID-19 testing information to the local and state health departments. In order to track trends over time, a data user can analyze this data by \"result_date\" and see how the count of reported results and positivity rate have changed over time.\n\n<strong>E.

{"resource": {"name": "San Francisco Department of Public Health Substance Use Services", "id": "ubf6-e57x", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong> \nThis dataset includes data on a variety of substance use services funded by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). This dataset only includes Drug MediCal-certified residential treatment, withdrawal management, and methadone treatment. Other private non-Drug Medi-Cal treatment providers may operate in the city. Withdrawal management discharges are inclusive of anyone who left withdrawal management after admission and may include someone who left before completing withdrawal management. \n\nThis dataset also includes naloxone distribution from the SFDPH Behavioral Health Services Naloxone Clearinghouse and the SFDPH-funded Drug Overdose Prevention and Education program. Both programs distribute naloxone to various community-based organizations who then distribute naloxone to their program participants. Programs may also receive naloxone from other sources. Data from these other sources is not included in this dataset. \n\nFinally, this dataset includes the number of clients on medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). \n\nThe number of people who were treated with methadone at a Drug Medi-Cal certified Opioid Treatment Program (OTP) by year is populated by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) Behavioral Health Services Quality Management (BHSQM) program. OTPs in San Francisco are required to submit patient billing data in an electronic medical record system called Avatar. BHSQM calculates the number of people who received methadone annually based on Avatar data. Data only from Drug MediCal certified OTPs were included in this dataset. \n\nThe number of people who receive buprenorphine by year is populated from the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES), administered by the California Department of Justice. All licensed prescribers in California are required to document controlled substance prescriptions in CURES. The Center on Substance Use and Health calculates the total number of people who received a buprenorphine prescription annually based on CURES data. Formulations of buprenorphine that are prescribed only for pain management are excluded.  \n\nPeople may receive buprenorphine and methadone in the same year, so you cannot add the Buprenorphine Clients by Year, and Methadone Clients by Year data together to get the total number of unique people receiving medications for opioid use disorder. \n\nFor more information on where to find treatment in San Francisco, visit <u><a href= \"https://findtreatment-sf.org/\">findtreatment-sf.org</a></u>.\u202f \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong> \nThis dataset is created by copying the data into this dataset from the SFDPH Behavioral Health Services Quality Management Program, the California Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES), and the Office of Overdose Prevention. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> \nResidential Substance Use Treatment, Withdrawal Management, Methadone, and Naloxone data are updated quarterly with a 45-day delay. Buprenorphine data are updated quarterly and when the state makes this data available, usually at a 5-month delay. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong> \nThroughout the year this dataset may include partial year data for methadone and buprenorphine treatment. As both methadone and buprenorphine are used as long-term treatments for opioid use disorder, many people on treatment at the end of one calendar year will continue into the next. For this reason, doubling (methadone), or quadrupling (buprenorphine) partial year data will not accurately project year-end totals.  \n\n<strong>E.

{"resource": {"name": "Police Department Stop Data", "id": "ubqf-aqzw", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThe San Francisco Police Department (SFPD)  Stop Data was designed to capture information to comply with the Racial and Identity Profiling Act (RIPA), or <u><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB953\"> California Assembly Bill (AB)953</a></u>. SFPD officers collect specific information on each stop, including elements of the stop, circumstances and the perceived identity characteristics of the individual(s) stopped. The information obtained by officers is reported to the California Department of Justice. This dataset includes data on stops starting on July 1st, 2018, which is when the data collection program went into effect. <u><a href=\"https://datasf.gitbook.io/datasf-dataset-explainers/police-department-stop-data\">Read the detailed overview for this dataset here.</a></u>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nBy the end of each shift, officers enter all stop data into the Stop Data Collection System, which is automatically submitted to the California Department of Justice (CA DOJ). Once a quarter the Department receives a stops data file from CA DOJ. The SFPD conducts several transformations of this data to ensure privacy, accuracy and compliance with State law and regulation. For increased usability, text descriptions have also been added for several data fields which include numeric codes (including traffic, suspicion, citation, and custodial arrest offense codes, and actions taken as a result of a stop). See the data dictionaries below for explanations of all coded data fields. <u><a href=\"https://datasf.gitbook.io/datasf-dataset-explainers/police-department-stop-data\">Read more about the data collection, and transformation, including geocoding and PII cleaning processes, in the detailed overview of this dataset.</a></u>\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nInformation is updated on a quarterly basis. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset includes information about police stops that occurred, including some details about the person(s) stopped, and what happened during the stop. Each row is a person stopped with a record identifier for the stop and a unique identifier for the person. A single stop may involve multiple people and may produce more than one associated unique identifier for the same record identifier. A certain percentage of stops have stop information that can\u2019t be geocoded. This may be due to errors in data input at the officer level (typos in entry or providing an address that doesn't exist). More often, this is due to officers providing a level of detail that isn't codable to a geographic coordinate - most often at the Airport (ie: Terminal 3, door 22.) In these cases, the location of the stops is coded as unknown.\n\n<strong>E.

{"resource": {"name": "Traffic Crashes Resulting in Injury", "id": "ubvf-ztfx", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis table contains all crashes resulting in an injury in the City of San Francisco. Fatality year-to-date crash data is obtained from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OME) death records, and only includes those cases that meet the San Francisco Vision Zero Fatality Protocol maintained by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH), San Francisco Police Department (SFPD), and San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). Injury crash data is obtained from SFPD\u2019s Interim Collision System for 2018 through the current year-to-date, Crossroads Software Traffic Collision Database (CR) for years 2013-2017 and the Statewide Integrated Transportation Record System (SWITRS) maintained by the California Highway Patrol for all years prior to 2013. Only crashes with valid geographic information are mapped. All geocodable crash data is represented on the simplified San Francisco street centerline model maintained by the Department of Public Works (SFDPW). Collision injury data is queried and aggregated on a quarterly basis. Crashes occurring at complex intersections with multiple roadways are mapped onto a single point and injury and fatality crashes occurring on highways are excluded.\n\nThe crash, party, and victim tables have a relational structure. The traffic crashes table contains information on each crash, one record per crash. The party table contains information from all parties involved in the crashes, one record per party. Parties are individuals involved in a traffic crash including drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and parked vehicles. The victim table contains information about each party injured in the collision, including any passengers. Injury severity is included in the victim table. \n\nFor example, a crash occurs (1 record in the crash table) that involves a driver party and a pedestrian party (2 records in the party table). Only the pedestrian is injured and thus is the only victim (1 record in the victim table). \n\nTo learn more about the traffic injury datasets, see the <u><a href=\"https://tims.berkeley.edu/help/SWITRS.php\">TIMS documentation</a></u>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nTraffic crash injury data is collected from the California Highway Patrol 555 Crash Report as submitted by the police officer within 30 days after the crash occurred. All fields that match the SWITRS data schema are programmatically extracted, de-identified, geocoded, and loaded into TransBASE. See Section D below for details regarding TransBASE. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nAfter review by SFPD and SFDPH staff, the data is made publicly available approximately a month after the end of the previous quarter (May for Q1, August for Q2, November for Q3, and February for Q4). \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis data is being provided as public information as defined under San Francisco and California public records laws. SFDPH, SFMTA, and SFPD cannot limit or restrict the use of this data or its interpretation by other parties in any way. Where the data is communicated, distributed, reproduced, mapped, or used in any other way, the user should acknowledge TransBASE.sfgov.org as the source of the data, provide a reference to the original data source where also applicable, include the date the data was pulled, and note any caveats specified in the associated metadata documentation provided. However, users should not attribute their analysis or interpretation of this data to the City of San Francisco. While the data has been collected and/or produced for the use of the City of San Francisco, it cannot guarantee its accuracy or completeness. Accordingly, the City of San Francisco, including SFDPH, SFMTA, and SFPD make no representation as to the accuracy of the information or its suitability for any purpose and disclaim any liability for omissions or errors that may be contained therein.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset represents probable or confirmed mpox cases among San Francisco residents. Cases are included by the episode date, defined as either the date when self-reported symptoms began or, if that date is not available, the date the positive test was collected (i.e., specimen collection date). \n\nData are lagged by 5 days, meaning that the most recent date of self-reported symptom or specimen collection included is 1 day prior to today. All data update daily as more information becomes available. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCase information is based on confirmed or probable positive laboratory tests reported to the San Francisco Department of Public Health. Processes to provide quality assurance and other data verification are completed before the data are reported. \n\nThis data may not be immediately available for recently reported cases because of the time needed to process tests and validate cases. \n\nData are continually updated to maximize completeness of information and reporting on San Francisco residents with confirmed or probable mpox.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates to the data are made through automated and manual processes once each day, Monday through Friday.  \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset shows new cases and cumulative cases (probable and confirmed) by episode date. Episode date is the date of self-reported symptom onset, or, if not available, date of specimen collection (i.e., the date the person was tested). \n\nNew cases are the count of cases with a symptom onset or specimen collection date on the given episode date. Cumulative cases are the running total of all San Francisco cases through the episode date listed.\n\n<strong>D.

The Plant Finder recommends appropriate habitat-building plants for sidewalks, gardens and roofs that are adapted to San Francisco's unique environment and climate.\r\n\r\nThe plants in the database include California natives and Mediterranean climate exotics. A large subset of the California natives are actually local San Francisco natives. We strongly recommend local natives since they provide the best habitat for local pollinators and other wildlife with whom they have co-evolved. San Francisco natives are the most closely adapted to the climate and environment of the San Francisco peninsula of course, and so they are the best in terms of water and soil conservation, ecosystem health, and overall sustainability.\r\n\r\nYou can get the geographic ares for plant communities represented in this dataset here: https://data.sfgov.org/d/27u4-a5b3", "attribution": "Cit and County of San Francisco Planning Department", "attribution_link": "http://sfplantfinder.org", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-09-06T00:44:44.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-06-28T17:25:11.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-09-06T00:44:44.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-06-28T17:25:33.000Z", "columns_name": ["Super60", "Shady_Clay_int", "Sandy_Soil", "Suitable_Site_Conditions", "Flower_Color", "Water_Needs", "Common_Name", "Top20_int", "PhotoCredit04", "PhotoCredit02", "Special_List", "Latin_Name", "Stormwater_int", "Habitat", "Sidewalk_Landscaping_Plants_int", "Super60_int", "Shady_Clay", "Pruning_Needs", "Sidewalk_Landscaping_Plants", "Climate_Appropriate_Plants", "Habitat_int", "Thrifty150", "Habitat_Value", "Plant_Communities", "Associated_Wildlife", "Sandy_Soil_int", "Size_at_Maturity", "Bloom_Time", "Former_Latin_Name", "Additional_Species_Cultivars_Varieties", "PhotoCredit03", "Top20", "Soil_Type", "Additional_Characteristices_Notes", "Plant_Type", "Family_Name", "Thrifty150_int", "PhotoCredit01", "Street_Tree_List", "Stormwater_Benefit", "Appropriate_Location", "Suggested_Green_Connection_Routes", "Nurseries"], "columns_field_name": ["super60", "shady_clay_int", "sandy_soil", "suitable_site_conditions", "flower_color", "water_needs", "common_name", "top20_int", "photocredit04", "photocredit02", "special_list", "latin_name", "stormwater_int", "habitat", "sidewalk_landscaping_plants_int", "super60_int", "shady_clay", "pruning_needs", "sidewalk_landscaping_plants", "climate_appropriate_plants", "habitat_int", "thrifty150", "habitat_value", "plant_communities", "associated_wildlife", "sandy_soil_int", "size_at_maturity", "bloom_time", "former_latin_name", "additional_species_cultivars_varieties", "photocredit03", "top20", "soil_type", "additional_characteristices_notes", "plant_type", "family_name", "thrifty150_int", "photocredit01", "street_tree_list", "stormwater_benefit", "appropriate_location", "suggested_green_connection_routes", "nurseries"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-06-28T17:31:59.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Energy and Environment", "domain_tags": ["environment", "green connections", "planning", "plant", "plantfinder", "plants", "sf plant finder"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Department-Metrics_Publishing-Department", "value": "Environment"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Publishing-frequency", "value": "Annually"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Data-change-frequency", "value": "Annually"}, {"key": "Detailed-Descriptive_Geographic-unit", "value": "Not applicable"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.sfgov.org", "license": "Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License"}, "permalink": "https://data.sfgov.org/d/vmnk-skih", "link": "https://data.sfgov.org/Energy-and-Environment/San-Francisco-Plant-Finder-Data/vmnk-skih", "owner": {"id": "wh9h-jktj", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "mikewynne"}, "creator": {"id": "wh9h-jktj", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "mikewynne"}}

A pedestrian safety zone is a painted buffered curb-side space between the sidewalk and moving vehicles. Their footprint resembles a bulb out, helping to emphasize that the space should not be treated as part of the roadway. As a low-cost, easily-implemented treatment, painted safety zones enhance pedestrian safety by (1) Improving line of sight between pedestrians and motorists and (2) Providing motorists with visual cues that encourage careful maneuvering near pedestrians. Painted safety zones do not extend the sidewalk, as pedestrians still wait to start their crossing at the existing curb line. However, their future conversion to concrete bulbouts will provide all the benefits of a wider sidewalk.\n\nB.

{"resource": {"name": "Housing Production - 2005-present", "id": "xdht-4php", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong> \nThis dataset includes completed or partially completed building permits that have resulted in the creation or loss of residential units since 2005 (through new construction of new units, demolition of existing units, or alteration of existing residential structures). This dataset also includes attributes for the number of affordable (below market rate) units by their affordability levels.\n \n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong> \nThis data is primarily based on unit changing permits in DBI\u2019s permit tracking system (PTS), but it includes occasional records related to housing developments that don\u2019t fall under DBI\u2019s purview (e.g. developments on State lands). The completion of permits is determined in different ways: 1) DBI\u2019s data on the issuance of Certificate of Final Completion (CFC) or Temporary Certificate of Occupancy (TCO), which covers the majority of housing unit completions since 2018 2) Permits\u2019 complete status in DBI\u2019s PTS, 3) manual review of Planning Department\u2019s legacy Housing Inventory data going back to 2005. Data on the affordability of units is primarily obtained from MOHCD\u2019s affordable portfolio and affordable portfolio. When the exact information on AMI levels is not available, but the total number of affordable units is known the AMI levels are estimated based on similar projects. This data is maintained in Planning Department\u2019s Housing Information System \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> \nThe Planning Department\u2019s Data and Analytics Group (DAG) updates this dataset annually on April 1. The underlying data for this dataset is maintained and updated in Planning Department\u2019s Housing Information System, which is updated through automated data pipelines every day \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong> \nThis dataset can be used to track the housing production trends in San Francisco. Note that the first and latest completion dates are often the same as in most permits, all units are deemed complete at the same date. But if units of a permit are completed at different times (through multiple TCOs/CFC) these dates show the first TCO data and the latest TCO, CFC, or PTS completion dates. The latest completion dates are not necessarily the same as the last completion dates, as the permit might be partially completed, and more units could be expected to be completed in the future. \n\n<strong>E.

There should be no interruption of service. Please reach out to support@datasf.org if you are experiencing any issues with the dataset.</strong>\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThe dataset inventory provides a list of data maintained by departments that are candidates for open data publishing or have already been published and is collected in accordance with Chapter 22D of the Administrative Code. The inventory will be used in conjunction with department publishing plans to track progress toward meeting plan goals for each department.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis dataset is collated through 2 ways:\n1. Ongoing updates are made throughout the year to reflect new datasets, this process involves DataSF staff reconciling publishing records after datasets are published\n2. Annual bulk updates - departments review their inventories and identify changes and updates and submit those to DataSF for a once a year bulk update - not all departments will have changes or their changes will have been captured over the course of the prior year already as ongoing updates\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe dataset is synced automatically daily, but the underlying data changes manually throughout the year as needed\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\n<em>Interpreting dates in this dataset</em>\nThis dataset has 2 dates:\n1. Date Added - when the dataset was added to the inventory itself\n2. First Published - the open data portal automatically captures the date the dataset was first created, this is that system generated date\n\nNote that in certain cases we may have published a dataset prior to it being added to the inventory. We do our best to have an accurate accounting of when something was added to this inventory and when it was published. In most cases the inventory addition will happen prior to publishing, but in certain cases it will be published and we will have missed updating the inventory as this is a manual process. \n\nFirst published will give an  accounting of when it was actually available on the open data catalog and date added when it was added to this list. \n\n<em>Companion systems inventory dataset</em>\nThis is a list of datasets published and unpublished, a companion <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Inventory-of-citywide-enterprise-systems-of-record/ebux-gcnq\">dataset of citywide enterprise systems of record can be accessed online</a> as well.", "attribution": "GSA - City Administrator's Office: DataSF", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-12-19T12:16:03.000Z", "createdAt": "2015-03-26T18:22:56.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-12-19T12:15:59.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-12-19T12:16:03.000Z", "columns_name": ["Publishing Status", "Publishing Approach", "Date Published", "Inventory ID", "Department or Division", "Dataset Name", "Dataset Description", "Data Classification", "Value", "Department Priority", "Date Added to Inventory", "Dataset ID", "Dataset Link", "Category", "Update Frequency", "data_processed_at", "data_last_changed_dt", "data_loaded_at"], "columns_field_name": ["publishing_status", "publishing_approach", "date_published", "inventory_id", "department_or_division", "dataset_name", "dataset_description", "data_classification", "value", "department_priority", "date_added", "dataset_id", "dataset_link", "category", "update_frequency", "data_processed_at", "data_last_changed_dt", "data_loaded_at"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "URL", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Calendar date"], "columns_description": ["The publishing status of the dataset.

SUMMARY</strong>\nSnapshot of San Francisco's Development Pipeline. Tracking of construction and entitlement activity based on data from Department of Building Inspection's Permit Tracking System and the Planning Department's Project & Permit Tracking System, processed quarterly. For more information please see http://sfplanning.org/pipeline-report\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe dataset is created by combining projects data from the City Planning Department and permit data from the Building Inspection Department to create a quarterly snapshot that shows when a project is filed to construction.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe Development Pipeline is updated as a quarterly snapshot of the construction development in the City of San Francisco.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nEach row or record is a project or permit. They are fitted with information such as address, block lot, project case number and spatial data that allow users to find the specific project. Each row also contains project specific information such as project description and details to illustrate the scope of the project.\n\n<strong>E. DATA NOTES </strong>\n\n<strong>Reporting Update</strong>\nSignificant data and systems improvements are underway to produce a more accurate quarterly pipeline, so the data may change at any time. Weekly and monthly data on Planning Applications and Building Permits can be accessed via the City's Open Data Portal.\n\n<strong>Change in Status Definitions</strong>\nThe following changes have been made in status definitions since the 2022 Q1 Pipeline Report to align the Quarterly Pipeline Reports with other Housing Reports (Housing Inventory and Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) Annual Progress)  <br>\n<strong> (1) Construction: </strong> projects that are authorized for construction deemed to be in the construction stage. A project is considered to be authorized for construction if it has:\no\tan issued full building permit, OR<br>\no\tan issued site permit with an approved first construction document<br>\nPast definition: projects that had their first inspection were deemed to be in the construction stage.<br>\n<strong> (2) Building Permit Issued: </strong> includes projects that have an issued site permit but don\u2019t yet have their first construction document. Housing units for these projects are not yet counted toward RHNA progress.<br>\nPast definition: included projects with any type of permit (site or full building permit) in the issued status.\n\nA data dictionary can be downloaded from the following link: \nhttps://sfplanninggis.s3.amazonaws.com/PipelineDataDictionary_10262022.xlsx", "attribution": "City and County of San Francisco, City Planning Department", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-12-22T00:56:01.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-12-13T21:27:46.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-12-22T00:56:01.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-12-13T21:35:39.000Z", "columns_name": ["HEIGHT_BUL", "MED", "YEAR_QTR", "CIE_EXIST", "Latitude", "UNITS", "YEAR", "LANDUSE", "HOTEL_ROOM_PROP", "SECTION415", "HOTEL_ROOM_EXIST", "LEGALIZATION", "Neighborhoods", "SF Find Neighborhoods", "MIPS_EXIST", "Current Police Districts", "Current Supervisor Districts", "Analysis Neighborhoods", "SD22", "State Density ALL", "BESTSTAT", "ObjectID", "BLKLOT", "NAMEADDR", "Entitled", "BESTDATE", "MIPSNET", "MIPS", "MEDNET", "MED_EXIST", "CIENET", "CIE", "NET_GSF", "TOTAL_GSF", "DBIDESC", "DESCRIPT", "BPAPPLNO", "CASENO", "CONTACT", "CONTACTPH", "DA", "PD", "NHOOD_37", "NHOOD_41", "ZONING", "ADU", "PDA", "SUD", "PLANS", "Longitude", "QTR", "HOTEL_ROOM_NET", "Lat/Long", "TENURE_TYPE", "AFF_TARGET", "Aff_Projection", "AFFORDABLENET", "Pipeline_Units", "UNITSNET", "PDR_EXIST", "TCOCFC_UNITS", "TCOCFC_DATE", "PDR", "PDRNET", "RET_EXIST", "RET", "RETNET", "VISIT_EXIST", "VISIT", "SPONSOR", "PLANNER", "VISITNET"], "columns_field_name": ["height_bul", "med", "year_qtr", "cie_exist", "latitude", "units", "year", "landuse", "hotel_room_prop", "section415", "hotel_room_exist", "legalization", ":@computed_region_jwn9_ihcz", ":@computed_region_6qbp_sg9q", "mips_exist", ":@computed_region_qgnn_b9vv", ":@computed_region_26cr_cadq", ":@computed_region_ajp5_b2md", "sd22", "state_density_all", "beststat", "objectid", "blklot", "nameaddr", "entitled", "bestdate", "mipsnet", "mips", "mednet", "med_exist", "cienet", "cie", "net_gsf", "total_gsf", "dbidesc", "descript", "bpapplno", "caseno", "contact", "contactph", "da", "pd", "nhood_37", "nhood_41", "zoning", "adu", "pda", "sud", "plans", "longitude", "qtr", "hotel_room_net", "lat_long", "tenure_type", "aff_target", "aff_projection", "affordablenet", "pipeline_units", "unitsnet", "pdr_exist", "tcocfc_units", "tcocfc_date", "pdr", "pdrnet", "ret_exist", "ret", "retnet", "visit_exist", "visit", "sponsor", "planner", "visitnet"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Checkbox", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Checkbox", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Checkbox", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Point", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "This column was automatically created in order to record in what polygon from the dataset 'Neighborhoods' (jwn9-ihcz) the point in column 'lat_long' is located.

SUMMARY</strong>\n\n<strong><i>Please note that the \"Data Last Updated\" date on this page denotes the most recent DataSF update and does not reflect the most recent update to this dataset. To confirm the completeness of this dataset please contact the District Attorney's office at <u><a href=\u201dmailto:districtattorney@sfgov.org\u201d>districtattorney@sfgov.org</a></u>.</strong></i>\n\nThis data set includes all criminal cases prosecuted by the District Attorney\u2019s Office that have reached a final resolution, or disposition. A case is resolved when a final determination has been made in court (i.e., an acquittal, conviction, dismissal, or a judge finds a defendant has successfully completed diversion).\n\nA case may also be resolved through other means. For example, a case may be re-indicted, a defendant may be released to another agency's custody, etc. Because of the case tracking systems used in the San Francisco Superior Court, these cases are assigned new court numbers and thus show up as distinct cases in the data available to the District Attorney\u2019s Office. Lastly, sometimes a defendant will have multiple criminal cases related to the same incident or similar types of crimes. The defendant may plead guilty to one case, and in exchange, the other cases will be dropped. The San Francisco Superior Court codes these cases as \"1385 PC - Guilty Plea to Other Charge\".\n\nMore information about this dataset can be found under the \u201cCase Resolutions\u201d section on the <u><a href=\"https://sfdistrictattorney.org/policy/data-dashboards/#case-resolutions\">Data Dashboards page</a></u>\n\n<strong><i>Disclaimer: The San Francisco District Attorney's Office does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information as the data is subject to change as modifications and updates are completed.</strong></i>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\n\nWhen a case prosecuted by the District Attorney\u2019s Office reaches a final resolution, or disposition, relevant data is manually entered into the District Attorney Office's case management system. Data reports are pulled from this system on a semi-regular basis, cleaned, anonymized, and added to Open Data.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\n\nWe strive to update this dataset at the beginning of every week. However, the creation of this dataset requires a manual pull from the Office's case management system and is dependent on staff availability.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\n\nPlease review the \u201cCase Resolutions\u201d section on the <u><a href=\"https://sfdistrictattorney.org/policy/data-dashboards/#case-resolutions\">Data Dashboards page</a></u> for more information about this dataset.\n\n<strong>E.

Tracking of construction and entitlement activity based on data from Department of Building Inspection's Permit Tracking System and the Planning Department's Project & Permit Tracking System, processed quarterly. For more information please see http://sfplanning.org/pipeline-report\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe dataset is created by combining projects data from the City Planning Department and permit data from the Building Inspection Department to create a quarterly snapshot that shows when a project is filed to construction.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe Development Pipeline is updated as a quarterly snapshot of the construction development in the City of San Francisco.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nEach row or record is a project or permit. They are fitted with information such as address, block lot, project case number and spatial data that allow users to find the specific project. Each row also contains project specific information such as project description and details to illustrate the scope of the project.\n\n<strong>E. DATA NOTES </strong>\n\n<strong>Reporting Update</strong>\nSignificant data and systems improvements are underway to produce a more accurate quarterly pipeline, so the data may change at any time. Weekly and monthly data on Planning Applications and Building Permits can be accessed via the City's Open Data Portal.\n\n<strong>Change in Status Definitions</strong>\nThe following changes have been made in status definitions since the 2022 Q1 Pipeline Report to align the Quarterly Pipeline Reports with other Housing Reports (Housing Inventory and Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) Annual Progress)  <br>\n<strong> (1) Construction: </strong> projects that are authorized for construction deemed to be in the construction stage. A project is considered to be authorized for construction if it has:\no\tan issued full building permit, OR<br>\no\tan issued site permit with an approved first construction document<br>\nPast definition: projects that had their first inspection were deemed to be in the construction stage.<br>\n<strong> (2) Building Permit Issued: </strong> includes projects that have an issued site permit but don\u2019t yet have their first construction document. Housing units for these projects are not yet counted toward RHNA progress.<br>\nPast definition: included projects with any type of permit (site or full building permit) in the issued status.\n\nA data dictionary can be downloaded from the following link: \nhttps://sfplanninggis.s3.amazonaws.com/PipelineDataDictionary_10262022.xlsx", "attribution": "City and County of San Francisco, City Planning Department", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-12-01T02:41:39.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-12-01T02:26:46.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-12-01T02:41:39.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-12-01T02:41:27.000Z", "columns_name": ["YEAR", "ADU", "PD", "SD22", "NHOOD_37", "NHOOD_41", "ZONING", "HEIGHT_BUL", "PDA", "AFFORDABLENET", "Pipeline_Units", "UNITSNET", "SUD", "PLANS", "Longitude", "Latitude", "TCOCFC_UNITS", "TCOCFC_DATE", "UNITS", "BESTDATE", "QTR", "BESTSTAT", "Entitled", "YEAR_QTR", "NAMEADDR", "BLKLOT", "LANDUSE", "ObjectID", "Analysis Neighborhoods", "Current Supervisor Districts", "Current Police Districts", "SF Find Neighborhoods", "Neighborhoods", "State Density ALL", "BPAPPLNO", "CASENO", "TENURE_TYPE", "AFF_TARGET", "SECTION415", "Aff_Projection", "DESCRIPT", "DBIDESC", "TOTAL_GSF", "NET_GSF", "CIE_EXIST", "CIE", "CIENET", "MED_EXIST", "MED", "MEDNET", "MIPS_EXIST", "MIPS", "MIPSNET", "PDR_EXIST", "PDR", "PDRNET", "RET_EXIST", "RET", "RETNET", "VISIT_EXIST", "VISIT", "VISITNET", "HOTEL_ROOM_EXIST", "HOTEL_ROOM_PROP", "Lat/Long", "HOTEL_ROOM_NET", "PLANNER", "SPONSOR", "CONTACT", "CONTACTPH", "DA", "LEGALIZATION"], "columns_field_name": ["year", "adu", "pd", "sd22", "nhood_37", "nhood_41", "zoning", "height_bul", "pda", "affordablenet", "pipeline_units", "unitsnet", "sud", "plans", "longitude", "latitude", "tcocfc_units", "tcocfc_date", "units", "bestdate", "qtr", "beststat", "entitled", "year_qtr", "nameaddr", "blklot", "landuse", "objectid", ":@computed_region_ajp5_b2md", ":@computed_region_26cr_cadq", ":@computed_region_qgnn_b9vv", ":@computed_region_6qbp_sg9q", ":@computed_region_jwn9_ihcz", "state_density_all", "bpapplno", "caseno", "tenure_type", "aff_target", "section415", "aff_projection", "descript", "dbidesc", "total_gsf", "net_gsf", "cie_exist", "cie", "cienet", "med_exist", "med", "mednet", "mips_exist", "mips", "mipsnet", "pdr_exist", "pdr", "pdrnet", "ret_exist", "ret", "retnet", "visit_exist", "visit", "visitnet", "hotel_room_exist", "hotel_room_prop", "lat_long", "hotel_room_net", "planner", "sponsor", "contact", "contactph", "da", "legalization"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Checkbox", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Checkbox", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Point", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Checkbox"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "This column was automatically created in order to record in what polygon from the dataset 'Analysis Neighborhoods' (ajp5-b2md) the point in column 'lat_long' is located.
