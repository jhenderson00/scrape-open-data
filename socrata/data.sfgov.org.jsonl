SUMMARY</strong>\nThe dataset includes details of all building permit applications filed with the Department of Building Inspection. Permit numbers and associated information may be repeated in multiple rows if there are multiple addresses associated with the permit.

HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe dataset is created by extracting permit characteristics and key dates (including permit filing, issuance, and completion dates) from DBI\u2019s Permit Tracking System.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe process that builds this dataset will run nightly and include all permits entered into the system up to the time of the refresh (see the \u201cdata as of\u201d column in the dataset).\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nUsers can use this dataset to search for all permits associated with a specific address or parcel number and view characteristics like addresses, permit descriptions of work, unit counts, valuations, etc. If the analytical objective is to measure permitting trends for all addresses, we recommend using the primary address building permits dataset.\n\n<b> A full data dictionary for this dataset is available by <u><a href=\"https://datasf.gitbook.io/datasf-dataset-explainers/dbi-building-permits-and-permit-addenda-data/building-permits-data-dictionary\">clicking here.</a></u> </b>\n\n<b>Note:</b> if you need to open this dataset in Excel, use one of the pre-filtered datasets.

This data includes a daily count of test results reported, and how many of those were positive, negative, and indeterminate. Reported tests include tests with a positive, negative or indeterminate result. Indeterminate results, which could not conclusively determine whether COVID-19 virus was present, are not included in the calculation of percent positive. Testing for the novel coronavirus is available through commercial, clinical, and hospital laboratories, as well as the SFDPH Public Health Laboratory.\n\nTests are de-duplicated by an individual and date. This means that if a person gets tested multiple times on different dates in the last 30 days, all of those individual tests will be included in this data as individual tests (on each specimen collection date).\n\n<strong>Total positive test results is not equal to the total number of COVID-19 cases in San Francisco.</strong>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nLaboratory test volume and positivity for COVID-19 is based on electronic laboratory test reports. Deduplication, quality assurance measures and other data verification processes maximize accuracy of laboratory test information.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nDue to the high degree of variation in the time needed to complete tests by different labs there is a delay in this reporting.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Testing by Race/Ethnicity Over Time", "id": "kja3-qsky", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset includes San Francisco COVID-19 tests by race/ethnicity and by date. This dataset represents the daily count of tests collected, and the breakdown of test results (positive, negative, or indeterminate). Tests in this dataset include all those collected from persons who listed San Francisco as their home address at the time of testing. It also includes tests that were collected by San Francisco providers for persons who were missing a locating address. This dataset does not include tests for residents listing a locating address outside of San Francisco, even if they were tested in San Francisco. \n\nThe data were de-duplicated by individual and date, so if a person gets tested multiple times on different dates, all tests will be included in this dataset (on the day each test was collected). If a person tested multiple times on the same date, only one test is included from that date. When there are multiple tests on the same date, a positive result, if one exists, will always be selected as the record for the person. If a PCR and antigen test are taken on the same day, the PCR test will supersede. If a person tests multiple times on the same day and the results are all the same (e.g. all negative or all positive) then the first test done is selected as the record for the person.\n\n<strong>The total number of positive test results is not equal to the total number of COVID-19 cases in San Francisco.</strong>\n\nWhen a person gets tested for COVID-19, they may be asked to report information about themselves. One piece of information that might be requested is a person's race and ethnicity. These data are often incomplete in the laboratory and provider reports of the test results sent to the health department. The data can be missing or incomplete for several possible reasons:\n\n\t\u2022 The person was not asked about their race and ethnicity.\n\t\u2022 The person was asked, but refused to answer.\n\t\u2022 The person answered, but the testing provider did not include the person's answers in the reports.\n\t\u2022 The testing provider reported the person's answers in a format that could not be used by the health department.\n\nFor any of these reasons, a person's race/ethnicity will be recorded in the dataset as \u201cUnknown.\u201d\n\n<strong>B. NOTE ON RACE/ETHNICITY</strong>\nThe different values for Race/Ethnicity in this dataset are \"Asian;\" \"Black or African             American;\" \"Hispanic or Latino/a, all races;\" \"American Indian or Alaska Native;\" \"Native                           Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander;\" \"White;\" \"Multi-racial;\" \"Other;\" and \u201cUnknown.\"\n\nThe Race/Ethnicity categorization increases data clarity by emulating the methodology used by the U.S. Census in the American Community Survey. Specifically, persons who identify as \"Asian,\" \"Black or African American,\" \"American Indian or Alaska Native,\" \"Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,\" \"White,\" \"Multi-racial,\" or \"Other\" do NOT include any person who identified as Hispanic/Latino at any time in their testing reports that either (1) identified them as SF residents or (2) as someone who tested without a locating address by an SF provider. All persons across all races who identify as Hispanic/Latino are recorded as \u201c\"Hispanic or Latino/a, all races.\" This categorization increases data accuracy by correcting the way \u201cOther\u201d persons were counted. Previously, when a person reported \u201cOther\u201d for Race/Ethnicity, they would be recorded \u201cUnknown.\u201d Under the new categorization, they are counted as \u201cOther\u201d and are distinct from \u201cUnknown.\u201d\n\nIf a person records their race/ethnicity as \u201cAsian,\u201d \u201cBlack or African American,\u201d \u201cAmerican Indian or Alaska Native,\u201d \u201cNative Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,\u201d \u201cWhite,\u201d or \u201cOther\u201d for their first COVID-19 test, then this data will not change\u2014even if a different race/ethnicity is reported for this person for any future COVID-19 test.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Deaths by Population Characteristics Over Time", "id": "kkr3-wq7h", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset shows San Francisco COVID-19 deaths by population characteristics and by date. Deaths are included on the date the individual died.\n\nPopulation characteristics are subgroups, or demographic cross-sections, like age, race, or gender. The City tracks how deaths have been distributed among different subgroups. This information can reveal trends and disparities among groups.\n\nData is lagged by five days, meaning the most date included is 5 days prior to today. All data update daily as more information becomes available. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCOVID-19 deaths are suspected to be associated with COVID-19. This means COVID-19 is listed as a cause of death or significant condition on the death certificate.  \n\nData on the population characteristics of COVID-19 deaths are from: \n* Case interviews \n* Laboratories \n* Medical providers \n\nThese multiple streams of data are merged, deduplicated, and undergo data verification processes. It takes time to process this data. Because of this, data is lagged by 5 days and death totals for previous days may increase or decrease. More recent data is less reliable. \n\nData are continually updated to maximize completeness of information and reporting on San Francisco COVID-19 deaths.\n\nData notes on each population characteristic type is listed below.\n\n<u> Race/ethnicity</u> \n* We include all race/ethnicity categories that are collected for COVID-19 cases.\n\n<u>Gender</u>\n* The City collects information on gender identity using <u><a href=\"https://www.sfdph.org/dph/files/PoliciesProcedures/COM5_SexGenderGuidelines.pdf\">these guidelines</a></u>.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 AM Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 AM and 09:00 AM in case of pipeline failure.\n\nDataset will not update on the business day following any federal holiday.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nPopulation estimates are only available for age groups and race/ethnicity categories. San Francisco population estimates for race/ethnicity and age groups can be found in a <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/cedd-86uf\">view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset</a>. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS). \n\nThis dataset includes many different types of characteristics. Filter the \u201cCharacteristic Type\u201d column to explore a topic area. Then, the \u201cCharacteristic Group\u201d column shows each group or category within that topic area and the number of deaths on each date. \n\nNew deaths are the count of deaths within that characteristic group on that specific date. Cumulative deaths are the running total of all San Francisco COVID-19 deaths in that characteristic group up to the date listed.\n\nThis data may not be immediately available for more recent deaths. Data updates as more information becomes available. \n\nTo explore data on the total number of deaths, use <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-19-Deaths-Over-Time/g2di-xufg\">the COVID-19 Deaths Over Time dataset</a></u>.\n\n<strong>E. ARCHIVED DATA</strong>\nCertain population characteristics that were once included in this dataset are no longer being reported publicly. An archived copy of these data can be found at this dataset here: <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/w6fd-iq9e\">ARCHIVED: COVID-19 Deaths by Population Characteristics Over Time</a>.\n\nThe archived dataset contains data on the following population characteristics that are no longer being reported publicly: \n<UL><LI>Skilled Nursing Facility Occupancy\n<LI>Sexual orientation\n<LI>Comorbidities\n<LI>Homelessness\n<LI>Single Room Occupancy (SRO) tenancy\n<LI>Transmission Type</UL>\n\n<strong>F.

An \u201cinterested party\u201d is a person who is a party, participant or agent of a party or participant to certain types of proceedings before the official in question. Those proceedings are limited to administrative enforcement proceedings and proceedings regarding permits, licenses, or other entitlements for use. A party to such a proceeding is someone who files an application for a license, permit, or entitlement for use or is the subject of the administrative enforcement. A participant in such a proceeding is someone who is not a party to the proceeding but who actively supports or opposes a particular decision in the proceeding and has a financial interest in the decision. An agent is someone who represents a party or a participant in such a proceeding.\n\nThe filing deadline for Form SFEC-3610(b) depends on the circumstances under which the behested payment was made.\n\nIf the behested payment was made while the proceeding involving the interested party is pending before the official, then the form must be filed within thirty days of the payment being made. If there is a series of behested payments, the form is due within 30 days of the payment that makes the total $1,000 or more.\n\nIf the behested payment was made within six months following the date on which a final decision was made in the proceeding involving the interested party, then the form must be filed within thirty days of the payment. If there is a series of behested payments, the form is due within 30 days of the payment that makes the total $1,000 or more.\n\nFinally, if the behested payment was made in the 12 months prior to the commencement of the proceeding involving the interested party, the form is due within 30 days of the date the official knew or should have known that the source of the behested payment became an interested party.\n\nEach row in this dataset represents information about payors reported in the \"Payors Information\" sub-table of a Form SFEC-3610(b) filed with the Ethics Commission.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Testing Over Time", "id": "nfpa-mg4g", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nCase information on COVID-19 Laboratory testing. This data includes a daily count of test results reported, and how many of those were positive, negative, and indeterminate. Reported tests include tests with a positive, negative or indeterminate result. Indeterminate results, which could not conclusively determine whether COVID-19 virus was present, are not included in the calculation of percent positive. Testing for the novel coronavirus is available through commercial, clinical, and hospital laboratories, as well as the SFDPH Public Health Laboratory.\n\nTests are de-duplicated by an individual and date. This means that if a person gets tested multiple times on different dates in the last 30 days, all of those individual tests will be included in this data as individual tests (on each specimen collection date).\n\n<strong>Total positive test results is not equal to the total number of COVID-19 cases in San Francisco.</strong>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nLaboratory test volume and positivity for COVID-19 is based on electronic laboratory test reports. Deduplication, quality assurance measures and other data verification processes maximize accuracy of laboratory test information.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nDue to the high degree of variation in the time needed to complete tests by different labs there is a delay in this reporting. On March 24 the Health Officer ordered all labs in the City to report complete COVID-19 testing information to the local and state health departments. In order to track trends over time, a data user can analyze this data by \"result_date\" and see how the count of reported results and positivity rate have changed over time.\n\n<strong>E. CHANGE LOG</strong>\n<UL><LI>6/21/2023 - A small number of additional COVID-19 testing records were released as part of our ongoing data cleaning efforts. \n<LI>1/31/2023 - renamed column \u201clast_updated_at\u201d to \u201cdata_as_of\u201d. \n<LI>1/31/2023 - added columns \u201ccumulative_tests\u201d, \u201ccumulative_positive_tests\u201d, \u201ccumulative_negative_tests\u201d, \u201ccumulative_indeterminate_tests\u201d. \n<LI>4/16/2021 - dataset updated to refresh with a five-day data lag.</UL>", "attribution": "Department of Public Health - Population Health Division", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-07-11T14:01:46.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-04-06T17:31:05.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-07-11T14:01:43.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-07-11T14:01:46.000Z", "columns_name": ["specimen_collection_date", "tests", "pos", "pct", "neg", "indeterminate", "cumulative_tests", "cumulative_positive_tests", "cumulative_negative_tests", "cumulative_indeterminate_tests", "data_as_of", "data_loaded_at"], "columns_field_name": ["specimen_collection_date", "tests", "pos", "pct", "neg", "indeterminate", "cumulative_tests", "cumulative_positive_tests", "cumulative_negative_tests", "cumulative_indeterminate_tests", "data_as_of", "data_loaded_at"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Calendar date"], "columns_description": ["Date that test was collected\u202f", "Total tests collected on the specified date", "Positive tests collected on the specified date", "Percent of tests that are positive on the specified date, as calculated by: the sum of all positive tests divided by the total number of positive and negative tests (indeterminate tests are excluded) ", "Negative tests collected on the specified date", "Indeterminate tests collected on the specified date ", "Total cumulative tests collected as of the specified date", "Cumulative positive tests collected as of the specified date", "Cumulative negative tests collected as of the specified date", "Cumulative indeterminate tests collected as of the specified date", "Timestamp for last update date in source system", "Timestamp when data entered the Socrata system"], "columns_format": [{"view": "date_ymd"}, {}, {}, {"precision": "3"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2023-01-31T18:15:07.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["public safety"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "COVID-19", "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Department-Metrics_Publishing-Department", "value": "Public Health"}, {"key": "Detailed-Descriptive_Geographic-unit", "value": "Other"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Data-change-frequency", "value": "Daily"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Publishing-frequency", "value": "Daily"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.sfgov.org", "license": "Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License"}, "permalink": "https://data.sfgov.org/d/nfpa-mg4g", "link": "https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-19-Testing-Over-Time/nfpa-mg4g", "owner": {"id": "dbag-6qd9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "OpenData"}, "creator": {"id": "dbag-6qd9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "OpenData"}}

Survey methodology was changed in 2015 from a mail to a phone survey, and expanded to include in-person and online options in 2023. Comparisons to previous years should be interpreted with caution. \n\nResults should be weighted using the column \"weight\" in order to adjust for demographic differences between the City Survey sample and San Francisco's population. Please note that survey results were originally reported as unweighted until 1997. From 1997 onward, all City Survey results were reweighted with the exception of data from 2011. For ease of use, the column \"weight\" has been coded with a value of one for these years. \n\nA code book is also attached to this dataset under About > Attachments.

{"resource": {"name": "Traffic Crashes Resulting in Injury: Victims Involved", "id": "nwes-mmgh", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis table contains all victims (parties who are injured) involved in a traffic crash resulting in an injury in the City of San Francisco. Fatality year-to-date crash data is obtained from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OME) death records, and only includes those cases that meet the San Francisco Vision Zero Fatality Protocol maintained by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH), San Francisco Police Department (SFPD), and San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). Injury crash data is obtained from SFPD\u2019s Interim Collision System for 2018 to YTD, Crossroads Software Traffic Collision Database (CR) for years 2013-2017 and the Statewide Integrated Transportation Record System (SWITRS) maintained by the California Highway Patrol for all years prior to 2013. Only crashes with valid geographic information are mapped. All geocodable crash data is represented on the simplified San Francisco street centerline model maintained by the Department of Public Works (SFDPW). Collision injury data is queried and aggregated on a quarterly basis. Crashes occurring at complex intersections with multiple roadways are mapped onto a single point and injury and fatality crashes occurring on highways are excluded.\n\nThe crash, party, and victim tables have a relational structure. The traffic crashes table contains information on each crash, one record per crash. The party table contains information from all parties involved in the crashes, one record per party. Parties are individuals involved in a traffic crash including drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and parked vehicles. The victim table contains information about each party injured in the collision, including any passengers. Injury severity is included in the victim table. \n\nFor example, a crash occurs (1 record in the crash table) that involves a driver party and a pedestrian party (2 records in the party table). Only the pedestrian is injured and thus is the only victim (1 record in the victim table).\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nTraffic crash injury data is collected from the California Highway Patrol 555 Crash Report as submitted by the police officer within 30 days after the crash occurred. All fields that match the SWITRS data schema are programmatically extracted, de-identified, geocoded, and loaded into TransBASE. See Section D below for details regarding TransBASE. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nAfter review by SFPD and SFDPH staff, the data is made publicly available approximately a month after the end of the previous quarter (May for Q1, August for Q2, November for Q3, and February for Q4). \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis data is being provided as public information as defined under San Francisco and California public records laws. SFDPH, SFMTA, and SFPD cannot limit or restrict the use of this data or its interpretation by other parties in any way. Where the data is communicated, distributed, reproduced, mapped, or used in any other way, the user should acknowledge TransBASE.sfgov.org as the source of the data, provide a reference to the original data source where also applicable, include the date the data was pulled, and note any caveats specified in the associated metadata documentation provided. However, users should not attribute their analysis or interpretation of this data to the City of San Francisco. While the data has been collected and/or produced for the use of the City of San Francisco, it cannot guarantee its accuracy or completeness. Accordingly, the City of San Francisco, including SFDPH, SFMTA, and SFPD make no representation as to the accuracy of the information or its suitability for any purpose and disclaim any liability for omissions or errors that may be contained therein. As all data is associated with methodological assumptions and limitations, the City recommends that users review methodological documentation associated with the data prior to its analy",

{"resource": {"name": "Sheriff Jail Bookings by Age Group", "id": "pfbp-75pz", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nTo confirm the completeness of this dataset please contact the Sheriff's Office at sheriff.tech.services@sfgov.org\n\nThe dataset provides summary information on individuals booked into the San Francisco City and County Jail since 2012, categorized by age group. The table provides a breakdown of the total number of bookings by month and age group. The unit of measure is the jail booking number. The data is collected by the Sheriff's Office and includes self-reported and assigned data.\n\nThe booking process refers to the procedure that occurs after an individual has been arrested and is taken into custody. The process begins with the arrest of an individual by law enforcement officers. The arrest can take place on the scene or at a later time if a warrant is issued. Once the individual has been arrested, and statutory law requires incarceration, they would be transported to the jail for booking. The arresting officer will record the reason for the arrest, along with any other relevant information. The sheriff\u2019s deputies will then book the individual into jail, which involves taking their fingerprints, photograph, and recording personal information. The jail will assign a booking number, which is used to identify the individual throughout their time in custody. Once the booking process is complete, the individual will be incarcerated and will remain in custody until they are released per court order.\n\nDisclaimer: The San Francisco Sheriff's Office does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information as the data is subject to change as modifications and updates are completed.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nWhen an arrest is presented to the Sheriff\u2019s Office, relevant data is manually entered into the Sheriff Office's jail management system. Data reports are pulled from this system on a semi-regular basis, and added to Open Data.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThis dataset is scheduled to update monthly\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis data can be used to identify trends and patterns in the jail population over time. The date in this dataset is based on the date the suspect was booked into county jail for the arresting incident. The unit of measurement for this dashboard is the booking number. A jail booking number is a unique identifier assigned to each individual who is booked into a jail facility. It is used to track the individual throughout their time in custody and to link their records to other relevant information, such as court appearances and medical records. \n\n<strong>E.

This dataset combines all schedules, pages, and includes unitemized totals. Only transactions from the \"most recent\" version of a filing (original/amendment) appear here.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCommittees file campaign statements with the Ethics Commission on a periodic basis. Those statements are stored with the Commission's data provider. Data is generally presented as-filed by committees.\n\nIf a committee files an amendment, the data from that filing completely replaces the original and any prior amendments in the filing sequence.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nEach night starting at midnight Pacific time a script runs to check for new filings with the Commission's database, and updates this dataset with transactions from new filings. The update process can take a variable amount of time to complete. Viewing or downloading this dataset while the update is running may result in incomplete data, therefore it is highly recommended to view or download this data before midnight or after 8am.\n\nDuring the update, some fields are copied from the Filings dataset into this dataset for viewing convenience. The copy process may occasionally fail for some transactions due to timing issues but should self-correct the following day. Transactions with a blank 'Filing Id Number' or 'Filing Date' field are such transactions, but can be joined with the appropriate record using the 'Filing Activity Nid' field shared between Filing and Transaction datasets.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>  \nTransactions from rejected filings are not included in this dataset. Transactions from many different FPPC forms and schedules are combined in this dataset, refer to the column \"Form Type\" to differentiate transaction types.\nProperties suffixed with \"-nid\" can be used to join the data between Filers, Filings, and Transaction datasets.\nRefer to the <a href=\"https://sfethics.org/disclosures/campaign-finance-disclosure/campaign-finance-disclosure-data\">Ethics

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Testing by Geography Over Time", "id": "qhc5-mubk", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset includes COVID-19 tests by resident neighborhood and specimen collection date (the day the test was collected). Specifically, this dataset includes tests of San Francisco residents who listed a San Francisco home address at the time of testing. These resident addresses were then geo-located and mapped to neighborhoods. The resident address associated with each test is hand-entered and susceptible to errors, therefore neighborhood data should be interpreted as an approximation, not a precise nor comprehensive total.\n\nIn recent months, about 5% of tests are missing addresses and therefore cannot be included in any neighborhood totals. In earlier months, more tests were missing address data. Because of this high percentage of tests missing resident address data, this neighborhood testing data for March, April, and May should be interpreted with caution (see below)\n\nPercentage of tests missing address information, by month in 2020\nMar - 33.6%\nApr - 25.9%\nMay - 11.1%\nJun - 7.2%\nJul - 5.8%\nAug - 5.4%\nSep - 5.1%\nOct (Oct 1-12) - 5.1%\n\nTo protect the privacy of residents, the City does not disclose the number of tests in neighborhoods with resident populations of fewer than 1,000 people. These neighborhoods are omitted from the data (they include Golden Gate Park, John McLaren Park, and Lands End).\n\nTests for residents that listed a Skilled Nursing Facility as their home address are not included in this neighborhood-level testing data. Skilled Nursing Facilities have required and repeated testing of residents, which would change neighborhood trends and not reflect the broader neighborhood's testing data.\n\nThis data was de-duplicated by individual and date, so if a person gets tested multiple times on different dates, all tests will be included in this dataset (on the day each test was collected). \n\n<strong>The total number of positive test results is not equal to the total number of COVID-19 cases in San Francisco. </strong>During this investigation, some test results are found to be for persons living outside of San Francisco and some people in San Francisco may be tested multiple times (which is common). To see the number of new confirmed cases by neighborhood, reference this map: https://sf.gov/data/covid-19-case-maps#new-cases-maps\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCOVID-19 laboratory test data is based on electronic laboratory test reports. Deduplication, quality assurance measures and other data verification processes maximize accuracy of laboratory test information. All testing data is then geo-coded by resident address. Then data is aggregated by analysis neighborhood and specimen collection date.\n\nData are prepared by close of business Monday through Saturday for public display.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nSan Francisco population estimates for geographic regions can be found in a <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/35v5-seg9\">view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset</a>. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS). \n\nDue to the high degree of variation in the time needed to complete tests by different labs there is a delay in this reporting. On March 24 the Health Officer ordered all labs in the City to report complete COVID-19 testing information to the local and state health departments. \n\nIn order to track trends over time, a data user can analyze this data by \"specimen_collection_date\".\n\nCalculating Percent Positivity: The positivity rate is the percentage of tests that return a positive result for COVID-19 (positive tests divided by the sum of positive and negative tests).

Trips by visitors to the Bay Area and for commercial purposes are not included.\n\u2022 Provide additional trip details, including trip purpose for each trip in the mode share question series.\n\u2022 Collect demographic data on the population of Bay Area residents who travel to, from, and within San Francisco.\n\u2022 Collect data on travel behavior and opinions that support other SFMTA strategy and project evaluation needs.\n\nThe survey was conducted as a telephone study among 801 Bay Area residents aged 18 and older. Interviewing was conducted in English, Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Tagalog. Surveying was conducted via random digit dial (RDD) and cell phone sample.\nAll survey datasets incorporate respondent weighting based on age and home location; utilize the \u201cweight\u201d field when appropriate in your analysis.\n\nThe survey period for this survey is as follows:\n2019: May - August 2019\n\nThe margin of error is related to sample size (n). For the total sample, the margin of error is 3.3% for a confidence level of 95%. When looking at subsets of the data, such as just the SF population, just the female population, or just the population of people who bicycle, the sample size decreases and the margin of error increases. Below is a guide of the margin of error for different samples sizes. Be cautious in making conclusions based off of small sample sizes.\n\nAt the 95% confidence level is:\n\u2022 n = 801(Total Sample). Margin of error = +/- 3.3%\n\u2022 n = 400. Margin of error = +/- 4.85%\n\u2022 n = 100.

The location also includes the Cultural Districts and Supervisor District that an artwork resides in. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nDataset is exported manually by staff from internal collections database and re-formatted manually by staff.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nDataset is updated as needed manually by staff.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nArtworks may be located at a specific addresses (traditional building number, street name format) or other locations (City Parks, Piers, SFO, etc.) that don't meet the traditional address format; in these cases, the closest intersection or building address has been used. Please look at the \"Location Description\" field for the location of the artwork (floor 2, International terminal, Northwest corner, etc.). An individual artwork can consist of a single piece or multiple pieces, this will be reflected in the last part of it's accession number with either a letter or number (i.e. 1904.2.a-b or 1999.22.1-2). A single artwork may have multiple entries, one for each part, or may have a single group entry. Therefore, the number of entries is not equivalent to the number of artworks. Generally, if an artworks' pieces are spread out over a distance, each piece will have an entry and if they are grouped at one location, there will be one group entry. When an artwork spans multiple blocks one end point was chosen for the address/map point. The data column \"number_of_districts\" refers to how many Cultural Districts a mural is in. If a mural is in more than Cultural Districts, the districts will be listed in the \"Cultural_District\" column and separated by a semicolon.

SUMMARY</strong>\nData on daily hospital bed use and available capacity at San Francisco acute care hospitals from April 2020 onward. Long Term Care facilities (like Laguna Honda and Kentfield) are not included in this data as acute care patients cannot be admitted to these facilities.\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis hospital capacity information is based on data that all SF acute care hospitals report to the San Francisco Department of Public Health.\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. This data is on a 4-day lag to account for the time needed to complete and validate data from all SF acute care hospitals. \n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis data provides visibility into current occupancy levels and use of San Francisco acute care hospitals and potential ability to accommodate anticipated surges of COVID patients. \nData includes current census of COVID-19 patients (including both confirmed cases and suspected COVID patients) and other patients in acute care hospitals, shown in the \u201cStatus\u201d column. The \u201cStatus\u201d column also includes all available beds.\nThis daily census information is stratified by type of bed (acute care, intensive care, and surge) in the \u201cBed Type\u201d column. Acute care beds treat patients with illnesses and injuries including recovery from surgeries. Intensive care (ICU) beds are for sicker patients in need of critical and life support services that can include the use of a ventilator. Surge beds are the additional beds that can be made available to handle an influx of COVID-19 patients; surge beds are differentiated between acute care surge beds and ICU surge beds.\nNote: The current census of COVID patients shown here may not always match the hospitalizations data (https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-19-Hospitalizations/nxjg-bhem), as that data includes all hospitals and long term care facilities.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Vaccinations Given to SF Residents Over Time", "id": "rutu-rpar", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong> \nThis dataset represents the COVID-19 vaccinations given to residents of San Francisco over time. All vaccines given to SF residents are included, no matter where the vaccination took place (the vaccine may have been administered in San Francisco or outside of San Francisco). This dataset also includes COVID-19 vaccinations given to SF residents by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) over time. \n\nData provides counts for residents who have received at least one dose, residents who have completed a primary vaccine series, residents who have received one or two monovalent (not bivalent) booster doses, and residents who have received a bivalent booster dose. A primary vaccine series is complete after an individual has received all intended doses of the initial series. There are one, two, and three dose primary vaccine series. \n \n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong> \nInformation on doses administered to those who live in San Francisco is from the <a href=\"https://cdph.ca.gov/CAIR\">California Immunization Registry (CAIR2)</a>, run by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). \n \n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> \nUpdated daily via automated process \n \n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong> \nBefore analysis, you must filter the dataset to the desired stratification of data using the \"administering_provider_type\" column. To get vaccination counts of all SF residents regardless of provider, filter to \"administering_provider_type\" = \u2018All Providers\u2019. To get vaccination counts administered by SFDPH to SF residents, filter to \"administering_provider_type\" = \u2018DPH Only\u2019. \n\nTo count the number of individuals vaccinated (with any primary series dose) for the first time on a given day, use the \"new_recipients\" column. To count the number of individuals who have completed their primary vaccine series on a given day, use the \"new_series_completed\" column. To count the number of primary series doses administered on a day (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or single doses), use the \"new_primary_series_doses\" column. \n \nTo count the number of individuals who received their first or second monovalent (not bivalent) booster dose on a given day, use the \"new_booster_recipients\" and \"new_2nd_booster_recipients\" columns. To count the number of individuals who received their first bivalent booster dose on a given day, use the \"new_bivalent_booster_recipients\" column. To count the number of monovalent (not including bivalent) or bivalent booster doses administered on a given day, use the \"new_booster_doses\" or \"new_bivalent_booster_doses\" columns.  \n\nTo count the number of individuals who have received a vaccine up to a certain date, use the columns beginning with \"cumulative_...\" \n\n<strong>E.

CHANGE LOG</strong> \n<UL><LI>10/27/2022 - the datasets COVID Vaccinations Given to SF Residents Over Time and COVID Vaccinations Given to SF Residents by SF DPH Over Time were merged into a single dataset. The column \u201cadministering_provider_type\u201d can be used to filter between the two metrics. These previous datasets can be found in the ARCHIVED DATA section. \n<LI>10/27/2022 - the columns \u201cnew_1st_doses\u201d, \u201cnew_2nd_doses\u201d, and \u201cnew_single_doses\u201d were removed and consolidated into the column \u201cnew_primary_series_doses\u201d (which also includes 3rd doses for the Pfizer Under 5 series). Similarly, the columns \u201ccumulative_1st_doses\u201d, \u201ccumulative_2nd_doses\u201d, \u201ccumulative_single_doses\u201d, were replaced by \u201ccumulative_primary_series_doses\u201d.</UL>", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-07-10T15:16:39.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-10-05T21:59:47.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-07-10T15:16:37.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-07-10T15:16:39.000Z", "columns_name": ["cumulative_2nd_booster_recipients", "cumulative_bivalent_booster_doses", "cumulative_booster_recipients", "cumulative_booster_doses", "cumulative_series_completed", "cumulative_recipients", "new_bivalent_booster_recipients", "new_bivalent_booster_doses", "new_recipients", "new_primary_series_doses", "date_administered", "cumulative_bivalent_booster_recipients", "new_series_completed", "cumulative_primary_series_doses", "new_2nd_booster_recipients", "new_booster_recipients", "new_booster_doses", "data_updated_at", "data_as_of", "administering_provider_type", "data_loaded_at"], "columns_field_name": ["cumulative_2nd_booster_recipients", "cumulative_bivalent_booster_doses", "cumulative_booster_recipients", "cumulative_booster_doses", "cumulative_series_completed", "cumulative_recipients", "new_bivalent_booster_recipients", "new_bivalent_booster_doses", "new_recipients", "new_primary_series_doses", "date_administered", "cumulative_bivalent_booster_recipients", "new_series_completed", "cumulative_primary_series_doses", "new_2nd_booster_recipients", "new_booster_recipients", "new_booster_doses", "data_updated_at", "data_as_of", "administering_provider_type", "data_loaded_at"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Text", "Calendar date"], "columns_description": ["Cumulative total individuals who have received their second monovalent booster dose.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Vaccinations Given to SF Residents by Demographics Over Time", "id": "sej3-bbrc", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong> \nThis dataset represents the COVID-19 vaccinations given to residents of San Francisco over time. All vaccines given to SF residents are included, no matter where the vaccination took place (the vaccine may have been administered in San Francisco or outside of San Francisco). The data are broken down by multiple demographic stratifications. This dataset also includes COVID-19 vaccinations given to SF residents by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) over time. \n\nData provides counts for residents who have received at least one dose, residents who have completed a primary vaccine series, residents who have received one or two monovalent (not bivalent) booster doses, and residents who have received a bivalent booster dose. A primary vaccine series is complete after an individual has received all intended doses of the initial series. There are one, two, and three dose primary vaccine series. \n \n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong> \nInformation on doses administered to those who live in San Francisco is from the <a href=\"https://cdph.ca.gov/CAIR \">California Immunization Registry (CAIR2)</a>, run by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The information on individuals\u2019 city of residence, age, race, and ethnicity are also recorded in CAIR and are self-reported at the time of vaccine administration. \n\nIn order to estimate the percent of San Franciscans vaccinated, we provide the 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) population estimates for each demographic group.\n \n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> \nUpdated daily via automated process \n \n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong> \nSan Francisco population estimates for race/ethnicity and age groups can be found in a <a href=\" https://data.sfgov.org/d/cedd-86uf\">view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset</a>. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS). \n\nBefore analysis, you must filter the dataset to the desired stratification of data using the \"overall_segment\" column. \n \nFor example, filtering \"overall_segment\" to \"All SF Residents by Age Bracket, Administered by All Providers\" will filter the data to residents whose vaccinations were administered by any provider. You can then further segment the data and calculate percentages by Age Brackets. \n \nIf you filter \"overall_segment\" to \"All SF Residents by Race/Ethnicity, Administered by DPH Only\", you will see the race/ethnicity breakdown for residents who received vaccinations from the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). \n\nIf you filter \"overall_segment\" to \"All SF Residents by Age Group, Administered by All Providers\" you will see vaccination counts of various age eligibility groups that were administered by any provider. \n\nTo count the number of individuals vaccinated (with any primary series dose) for the first time on a given day, use the \"new_recipients\" column. To count the number of individuals who have completed their primary vaccine series on a given day, use the \"new_series_completed\" column. To count the number of primary series doses administered on a day (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or single doses), use the \"new_primary_series_doses\" column. \n \nTo count the number of individuals who received their first or second monovalent (not bivalent) booster dose on a given day, use the \"new_booster_recipients\" and \"new_2nd_booster_recipients\" columns. To count the number of individuals who received their first bivalent booster dose on a given day, use the \"new_bivalent_booster_recipients\" column. To count the number of monovalent (not including bivalent) or bivalent booster doses administered on a given day, use the \"new_booster_doses\" or \"new_bivalent_booster_doses\" columns.  \n\nTo count the number of individuals who have received a vaccine up to a certain date, use the columns beginning with \"cumulative_...\" \n\n<strong>E.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Cases and Deaths Summarized by Geography", "id": "tpyr-dvnc", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nMedical provider confirmed COVID-19 cases and confirmed COVID-19 related deaths in San Francisco, CA aggregated by several different geographic areas and normalized by 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates for population data to calculate rate per 10,000 residents.\n\nOn September 12, 2021, a new case definition of COVID-19 was introduced that includes criteria for enumerating new infections after previous probable or confirmed infections (also known as reinfections). A reinfection is defined as a confirmed positive PCR lab test more than 90 days after a positive PCR or antigen test. The first reinfection case was identified on December 7, 2021.\n\nCases and deaths are both mapped to the residence of the individual, not to where they were infected or died. For example, if one was infected in San Francisco at work but lives in the East Bay, those are not counted as SF Cases or if one dies in Zuckerberg San Francisco General but is from another county, that is also not counted in this dataset.\n\nDataset is cumulative and covers cases going back to 3/2/2020 when testing began. \n\nGeographic areas summarized are:\n1. <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Analysis-Neighborhoods-2020-census-tracts-assigned/sevw-6tgi\">Analysis Neighborhoods</a>\n2. <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Census-2020-Tracts-for-San-Francisco/tmph-tgz9\">Census Tracts</a>\n3. <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html\">Census Zip Code Tabulation Areas</a>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nAddresses from medical data are geocoded by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). Those addresses are spatially joined to the geographic areas. Counts are generated based on the number of address points that match each geographic area. The 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) population estimates provided by the Census are used to create a rate which is equal to <i>([count] / [acs_population]) * 10000)</i> representing the number of cases per 10,000 residents.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nGeographic analysis is scripted by SFDPH staff and synced to this dataset daily at 7:30 Pacific Time. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nSan Francisco population estimates for geographic regions can be found in a <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/35v5-seg9\">view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset</a>. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS).\n\n<em>Privacy rules in effect</em>\nTo protect privacy, certain rules are in effect:\n1. Case counts greater than 0 and less than 10 are dropped - these will be null (blank) values\n2. Death counts greater than 0 and less than 10 are dropped - these will be null (blank) values\n3. Cases and deaths dropped altogether for areas where acs_population < 1000\n\n<em>Rate suppression in effect where counts lower than 20</em>\nRates are not calculated unless the case count is greater than or equal to 20. Rates are generally unstable at small numbers, so we avoid calculating them directly. We advise you to apply the same approach as this is best practice in epidemiology.\n\n<em>A note on Census ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)</em>\nZIP Code Tabulation Areas are special boundaries created by the U.S. Census based on ZIP Codes developed by the USPS. They are not, however, the same thing. ZCTAs are areal representations of routes. <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html\">Read how the Census develops ZCTAs on their website</a>.\n\n<em>Row included for Citywide case counts, incidence rate, and deaths</em>\nA single row is included that has the Citywide case counts and incidence rate. This can be used for comparisons. Citywide will capture all cases regardless of address quality.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset is a cleaned and anonymized version of survey data gathered in FY23 from nonprofits who contract with the City and County of San Francisco. Each row is one organization and data includes general information about the nonprofit's services, finances, and operations, and summary demographic data about each nonprofit's workforce. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis dataset was generated through conducting a two-tiered survey gathering data on organizational characteristics and position-level data from nonprofits who contract with the City and County of San Francisco in FY23. The survey was fielded in October and November of 2022. 152 nonprofits provided organizational-level data and summary data about their workforce. 29 of those organizations (referred to as \"Cohort Organizations\") provided additional position-level data. This dataset includes organization-level data for the 152 respondent organizations. For further details on survey methodology, please review page 39 of the Nonprofit Wage and Equity Survey report, linked below in \"Related Reports.\"\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nData is a one-time survey and will not update.\n\n<strong>D.

{"resource": {"name": "Traffic Crashes Resulting in Injury", "id": "ubvf-ztfx", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis table contains all crashes resulting in an injury in the City of San Francisco. Fatality year-to-date crash data is obtained from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OME) death records, and only includes those cases that meet the San Francisco Vision Zero Fatality Protocol maintained by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH), San Francisco Police Department (SFPD), and San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). Injury crash data is obtained from SFPD\u2019s Interim Collision System for 2018 through the current year-to-date, Crossroads Software Traffic Collision Database (CR) for years 2013-2017 and the Statewide Integrated Transportation Record System (SWITRS) maintained by the California Highway Patrol for all years prior to 2013. Only crashes with valid geographic information are mapped. All geocodable crash data is represented on the simplified San Francisco street centerline model maintained by the Department of Public Works (SFDPW). Collision injury data is queried and aggregated on a quarterly basis. Crashes occurring at complex intersections with multiple roadways are mapped onto a single point and injury and fatality crashes occurring on highways are excluded.\n\nThe crash, party, and victim tables have a relational structure. The traffic crashes table contains information on each crash, one record per crash. The party table contains information from all parties involved in the crashes, one record per party. Parties are individuals involved in a traffic crash including drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and parked vehicles. The victim table contains information about each party injured in the collision, including any passengers. Injury severity is included in the victim table. \n\nFor example, a crash occurs (1 record in the crash table) that involves a driver party and a pedestrian party (2 records in the party table). Only the pedestrian is injured and thus is the only victim (1 record in the victim table). \n\nTo learn more about the traffic injury datasets, see the <u><a href=\"https://tims.berkeley.edu/help/SWITRS.php\">TIMS documentation</a></u>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nTraffic crash injury data is collected from the California Highway Patrol 555 Crash Report as submitted by the police officer within 30 days after the crash occurred. All fields that match the SWITRS data schema are programmatically extracted, de-identified, geocoded, and loaded into TransBASE. See Section D below for details regarding TransBASE. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nAfter review by SFPD and SFDPH staff, the data is made publicly available approximately a month after the end of the previous quarter (May for Q1, August for Q2, November for Q3, and February for Q4). \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis data is being provided as public information as defined under San Francisco and California public records laws. SFDPH, SFMTA, and SFPD cannot limit or restrict the use of this data or its interpretation by other parties in any way. Where the data is communicated, distributed, reproduced, mapped, or used in any other way, the user should acknowledge TransBASE.sfgov.org as the source of the data, provide a reference to the original data source where also applicable, include the date the data was pulled, and note any caveats specified in the associated metadata documentation provided. However, users should not attribute their analysis or interpretation of this data to the City of San Francisco. While the data has been collected and/or produced for the use of the City of San Francisco, it cannot guarantee its accuracy or completeness. Accordingly, the City of San Francisco, including SFDPH, SFMTA, and SFPD make no representation as to the accuracy of the information or its suitability for any purpose and disclaim any liability for omissions or errors that may be contained therein.

{"resource": {"name": "Mpox Cases Over Time", "id": "vi7r-brsi", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset represents probable or confirmed mpox cases among San Francisco residents. Cases are included by the episode date, defined as either the date when self-reported symptoms began or, if that date is not available, the date the positive test was collected (i.e., specimen collection date). \n\nData are lagged by 5 days, meaning that the most recent date of self-reported symptom or specimen collection included is 1 day prior to today. All data update daily as more information becomes available. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCase information is based on confirmed or probable positive laboratory tests reported to the San Francisco Department of Public Health. Processes to provide quality assurance and other data verification are completed before the data are reported. \n\nThis data may not be immediately available for recently reported cases because of the time needed to process tests and validate cases. \n\nData are continually updated to maximize completeness of information and reporting on San Francisco residents with confirmed or probable mpox.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates to the data are made through automated and manual processes once each day, Monday through Friday.  \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset shows new cases and cumulative cases (probable and confirmed) by episode date. Episode date is the date of self-reported symptom onset, or, if not available, date of specimen collection (i.e., the date the person was tested). \n\nNew cases are the count of cases with a symptom onset or specimen collection date on the given episode date. Cumulative cases are the running total of all San Francisco cases through the episode date listed.\n\n<strong>D.

The Plant Finder recommends appropriate habitat-building plants for sidewalks, gardens and roofs that are adapted to San Francisco's unique environment and climate.\r\n\r\nThe plants in the database include California natives and Mediterranean climate exotics. A large subset of the California natives are actually local San Francisco natives. We strongly recommend local natives since they provide the best habitat for local pollinators and other wildlife with whom they have co-evolved. San Francisco natives are the most closely adapted to the climate and environment of the San Francisco peninsula of course, and so they are the best in terms of water and soil conservation, ecosystem health, and overall sustainability.\r\n\r\nYou can get the geographic ares for plant communities represented in this dataset here: https://data.sfgov.org/d/27u4-a5b3", "attribution": "Cit and County of San Francisco Planning Department", "attribution_link": "http://sfplantfinder.org", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-09-06T00:44:44.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-06-28T17:25:11.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-09-06T00:44:44.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-06-28T17:25:33.000Z", "columns_name": ["Additional_Characteristices_Notes", "PhotoCredit02", "Shady_Clay_int", "Bloom_Time", "Plant_Type", "PhotoCredit04", "Family_Name", "Super60_int", "Latin_Name", "Thrifty150_int", "Habitat_int", "Sandy_Soil", "Common_Name", "Flower_Color", "Suitable_Site_Conditions", "Soil_Type", "Habitat_Value", "Stormwater_Benefit", "Appropriate_Location", "Suggested_Green_Connection_Routes", "Street_Tree_List", "PhotoCredit01", "PhotoCredit03", "Additional_Species_Cultivars_Varieties", "Sidewalk_Landscaping_Plants", "Thrifty150", "Sandy_Soil_int", "Super60", "Top20_int", "Water_Needs", "Top20", "Sidewalk_Landscaping_Plants_int", "Habitat", "Special_List", "Nurseries", "Stormwater_int", "Pruning_Needs", "Climate_Appropriate_Plants", "Former_Latin_Name", "Shady_Clay", "Plant_Communities", "Associated_Wildlife", "Size_at_Maturity"], "columns_field_name": ["additional_characteristices_notes", "photocredit02", "shady_clay_int", "bloom_time", "plant_type", "photocredit04", "family_name", "super60_int", "latin_name", "thrifty150_int", "habitat_int", "sandy_soil", "common_name", "flower_color", "suitable_site_conditions", "soil_type", "habitat_value", "stormwater_benefit", "appropriate_location", "suggested_green_connection_routes", "street_tree_list", "photocredit01", "photocredit03", "additional_species_cultivars_varieties", "sidewalk_landscaping_plants", "thrifty150", "sandy_soil_int", "super60", "top20_int", "water_needs", "top20", "sidewalk_landscaping_plants_int", "habitat", "special_list", "nurseries", "stormwater_int", "pruning_needs", "climate_appropriate_plants", "former_latin_name", "shady_clay", "plant_communities", "associated_wildlife", "size_at_maturity"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-06-28T17:31:59.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Energy and Environment", "domain_tags": ["environment", "green connections", "planning", "plant", "plantfinder", "plants", "sf plant finder"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Department-Metrics_Publishing-Department", "value": "Environment"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Publishing-frequency", "value": "Annually"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Data-change-frequency", "value": "Annually"}, {"key": "Detailed-Descriptive_Geographic-unit", "value": "Not applicable"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.sfgov.org", "license": "Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License"}, "permalink": "https://data.sfgov.org/d/vmnk-skih", "link": "https://data.sfgov.org/Energy-and-Environment/San-Francisco-Plant-Finder-Data/vmnk-skih", "owner": {"id": "wh9h-jktj", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "mikewynne"}, "creator": {"id": "wh9h-jktj", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "mikewynne"}}

A pedestrian safety zone is a painted buffered curb-side space between the sidewalk and moving vehicles. Their footprint resembles a bulb out, helping to emphasize that the space should not be treated as part of the roadway. As a low-cost, easily-implemented treatment, painted safety zones enhance pedestrian safety by (1) Improving line of sight between pedestrians and motorists and (2) Providing motorists with visual cues that encourage careful maneuvering near pedestrians. Painted safety zones do not extend the sidewalk, as pedestrians still wait to start their crossing at the existing curb line. However, their future conversion to concrete bulbouts will provide all the benefits of a wider sidewalk.\n\nB.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset contains a growing list of all \"Public Water Assets\" managed by the City and County of San Francisco. The data is split up into two main categories: \"Restrooms\" and \"Drinking Water.\" The goal of this dataset is to provide a centralized list of water assets regardless of departmental ownership or location.\n\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis dataset combines water asset information from multiple departments including: Recreation and Parks, Public Utilities Commission, Department of Public Works. Data is pulled from each department's system or via file extract, it is then combined into a data model, and published.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThis dataset will be updated as needed. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset can be used to locate restrooms and drinking fountains across the city. It can also be used to populate maps where this information would be valuable to the user. \n\n<strong>E.

DataSF staff are delayed on a full update because of the ongoing COVID-19 response but are working with departments to complete that annual update by end of July.\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThe dataset inventory provides a list of data maintained by departments that are candidates for open data publishing or have already been published and is collected in accordance with Chapter 22D of the Administrative Code. The inventory will be used in conjunction with department publishing plans to track progress toward meeting plan goals for each department. Department publishing plans are available at https://datasf.org/publishing/plans\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis dataset is collated through 2 ways:\n1. Ongoing updates are made throughout the year to reflect new datasets, this process involves DataSF staff reconciling publishing records after datasets are published\n2. Annual bulk updates - departments review their inventories and identify changes and updates and submit those to DataSF for a once a year bulk update - not all departments will have changes or their changes will have been captured over the course of the prior year already as ongoing updates\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe dataset is synced automatically daily, but the underlying data changes manually throughout the year as needed\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\n<em>Interpreting dates in this dataset</em>\nThis dataset has 3 dates:\n1. Date Added - when the dataset was added to the inventory itself\n2. First Published - when the dataset was initially published on the platform\n3. Date Created on Platform - the open data portal automatically captures the date the dataset was first created, this is that system generated date\n\nNote that in certain cases we may have published a dataset prior to it being added to the inventory. We do our best to have an accurate accounting of when something was added to this inventory and when it was published. In most cases the inventory addition will happen prior to publishing, but in certain cases it will be published and we will have missed updating the inventory as this is a manual process. \n\nFirst published will give an  accounting of when it was actually available on the open data catalog and date added when it was added to this list. \n\nDate Created on Platform will show when a dataset was initially created. Because datasets are created and re-created as underlying systems changed, this date can be after the first published date if, for example, there was a new dataset published as an improvement over a previous one. Additionally, for new datasets, this date is often prior to the first published date as it is created, reviewed, QA'd and prepared for release.\n\n<em>Companion systems inventory dataset</em>\nThis is a list of datasets published and unpublished, a companion <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Inventory-of-citywide-enterprise-systems-of-record/ebux-gcnq\">dataset of citywide enterprise systems of record can be accessed online</a> as well.", "attribution": "GSA - City Administrator's Office: DataSF", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-07-11T07:37:20.000Z", "createdAt": "2015-03-26T18:22:56.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-04-20T22:56:27.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-07-11T07:37:20.000Z", "columns_name": ["Date Created on Platform", "Dataset ID", "Date Added", "Department Priority", "Dataset Name", "Category", "Publishing Status", "Dataset Description", "Publishing Approach", "First Published", "Value", "Automated By", "Inventory ID", "Dataset Link", "Data Classification", "Department or Division"], "columns_field_name": ["date_created_on_platform", "dataset_id", "date_added", "department_priority", "dataset_name", "category", "publishing_status", "dataset_description", "publishing_approach", "first_published", "value", "automated_by", "inventory_id", "dataset_link", "data_classification", "department_or_division"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "URL", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["This is the date the dataset was created in the platform.

SUMMARY</strong>\nSnapshot of San Francisco's Development Pipeline. Tracking of construction and entitlement activity based on data from Department of Building Inspection's Permit Tracking System and the Planning Department's Project & Permit Tracking System, processed quarterly. For more information please see http://sfplanning.org/pipeline-report\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe dataset is created by combining projects data from the City Planning Department and permit data from the Building Inspection Department to create a quarterly snapshot that shows when a project is filed to construction.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe Development Pipeline is updated as a quarterly snapshot of the construction development in the City of San Francisco.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nEach row or record is a project or permit. They are fitted with information such as address, block lot, project case number and spatial data that allow users to find the specific project. Each row also contains project specific information such as project description and details to illustrate the scope of the project.\n\n<strong>E. DATA NOTES </strong>\n\n<strong>Reporting Update</strong>\nSignificant data and systems improvements are underway to produce a more accurate quarterly pipeline, so the data may change at any time. Weekly and monthly data on Planning Applications and Building Permits can be accessed via the City's Open Data Portal.\n\n<strong>Change in Status Definitions</strong>\nThe following changes have been made in status definitions since the 2022 Q1 Pipeline Report to align the Quarterly Pipeline Reports with other Housing Reports (Housing Inventory and Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) Annual Progress)  <br>\n<strong> (1) Construction: </strong> projects that are authorized for construction deemed to be in the construction stage. A project is considered to be authorized for construction if it has:\no\tan issued full building permit, OR<br>\no\tan issued site permit with an approved first construction document<br>\nPast definition: projects that had their first inspection were deemed to be in the construction stage.<br>\n<strong> (2) Building Permit Issued: </strong> includes projects that have an issued site permit but don\u2019t yet have their first construction document. Housing units for these projects are not yet counted toward RHNA progress.<br>\nPast definition: included projects with any type of permit (site or full building permit) in the issued status.\n\nA data dictionary can be downloaded from the following link: \nhttps://sfplanninggis.s3.amazonaws.com/PipelineDataDictionary_10262022.xlsx", "attribution": "City and County of San Francisco, City Planning Department", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-12-22T00:56:01.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-12-13T21:27:46.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-12-22T00:56:01.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-12-13T21:35:39.000Z", "columns_name": ["Neighborhoods", "HOTEL_ROOM_NET", "ADU", "MIPS_EXIST", "SD22", "State Density ALL", "BESTSTAT", "MED", "YEAR_QTR", "CIE_EXIST", "Latitude", "UNITS", "YEAR", "LANDUSE", "HOTEL_ROOM_PROP", "SECTION415", "HOTEL_ROOM_EXIST", "LEGALIZATION", "SF Find Neighborhoods", "Current Police Districts", "Current Supervisor Districts", "Analysis Neighborhoods", "ObjectID", "BLKLOT", "NAMEADDR", "Entitled", "BESTDATE", "TCOCFC_DATE", "TCOCFC_UNITS", "UNITSNET", "Pipeline_Units", "AFFORDABLENET", "Aff_Projection", "AFF_TARGET", "TENURE_TYPE", "CASENO", "BPAPPLNO", "DESCRIPT", "DBIDESC", "TOTAL_GSF", "NET_GSF", "CIE", "CIENET", "MED_EXIST", "MEDNET", "MIPS", "MIPSNET", "PDR_EXIST", "PDR", "PDRNET", "RET_EXIST", "RET", "RETNET", "VISIT_EXIST", "VISIT", "VISITNET", "PLANNER", "SPONSOR", "CONTACT", "CONTACTPH", "DA", "PD", "NHOOD_37", "NHOOD_41", "ZONING", "HEIGHT_BUL", "PDA", "SUD", "PLANS", "Longitude", "QTR", "Lat/Long"], "columns_field_name": [":@computed_region_jwn9_ihcz", "hotel_room_net", "adu", "mips_exist", "sd22", "state_density_all", "beststat", "med", "year_qtr", "cie_exist", "latitude", "units", "year", "landuse", "hotel_room_prop", "section415", "hotel_room_exist", "legalization", ":@computed_region_6qbp_sg9q", ":@computed_region_qgnn_b9vv", ":@computed_region_26cr_cadq", ":@computed_region_ajp5_b2md", "objectid", "blklot", "nameaddr", "entitled", "bestdate", "tcocfc_date", "tcocfc_units", "unitsnet", "pipeline_units", "affordablenet", "aff_projection", "aff_target", "tenure_type", "caseno", "bpapplno", "descript", "dbidesc", "total_gsf", "net_gsf", "cie", "cienet", "med_exist", "mednet", "mips", "mipsnet", "pdr_exist", "pdr", "pdrnet", "ret_exist", "ret", "retnet", "visit_exist", "visit", "visitnet", "planner", "sponsor", "contact", "contactph", "da", "pd", "nhood_37", "nhood_41", "zoning", "height_bul", "pda", "sud", "plans", "longitude", "qtr", "lat_long"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Checkbox", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Checkbox", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Checkbox", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Point"], "columns_description": ["This column was automatically created in order to record in what polygon from the dataset 'Neighborhoods' (jwn9-ihcz) the point in column 'lat_long' is located.

SUMMARY</strong>\n\n<strong><i>Please note that the \"Data Last Updated\" date on this page denotes the most recent DataSF update and does not reflect the most recent update to this dataset. To confirm the completeness of this dataset please contact the District Attorney's office at <u><a href=\u201dmailto:districtattorney@sfgov.org\u201d>districtattorney@sfgov.org</a></u>.</strong></i>\n\nThis data set includes all criminal cases prosecuted by the District Attorney\u2019s Office that have reached a final resolution, or disposition. A case is resolved when a final determination has been made in court (i.e., an acquittal, conviction, dismissal, or a judge finds a defendant has successfully completed diversion).\n\nA case may also be resolved through other means. For example, a case may be re-indicted, a defendant may be released to another agency's custody, etc. Because of the case tracking systems used in the San Francisco Superior Court, these cases are assigned new court numbers and thus show up as distinct cases in the data available to the District Attorney\u2019s Office. Lastly, sometimes a defendant will have multiple criminal cases related to the same incident or similar types of crimes. The defendant may plead guilty to one case, and in exchange, the other cases will be dropped. The San Francisco Superior Court codes these cases as \"1385 PC - Guilty Plea to Other Charge\".\n\nMore information about this dataset can be found under the \u201cCase Resolutions\u201d section on the <u><a href=\"https://sfdistrictattorney.org/policy/data-dashboards/#case-resolutions\">Data Dashboards page</a></u>\n\n<strong><i>Disclaimer: The San Francisco District Attorney's Office does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information as the data is subject to change as modifications and updates are completed.</strong></i>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\n\nWhen a case prosecuted by the District Attorney\u2019s Office reaches a final resolution, or disposition, relevant data is manually entered into the District Attorney Office's case management system. Data reports are pulled from this system on a semi-regular basis, cleaned, anonymized, and added to Open Data.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\n\nWe strive to update this dataset at the beginning of every week.

The centroid of each footprint was used to join a property identifier from a draft of the San Francisco Enterprise GIS Program's cartographic base, which provides continuous coverage with distinct right-of-way areas as well as selected nearby parcels from adjacent counties.

{"resource": {"name": "SF Development Pipeline 2022 Q3", "id": "ywks-3zda", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nSnapshot of San Francisco's Development Pipeline. Tracking of construction and entitlement activity based on data from Department of Building Inspection's Permit Tracking System and the Planning Department's Project & Permit Tracking System, processed quarterly. For more information please see http://sfplanning.org/pipeline-report\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe dataset is created by combining projects data from the City Planning Department and permit data from the Building Inspection Department to create a quarterly snapshot that shows when a project is filed to construction.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe Development Pipeline is updated as a quarterly snapshot of the construction development in the City of San Francisco.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nEach row or record is a project or permit. They are fitted with information such as address, block lot, project case number and spatial data that allow users to find the specific project. Each row also contains project specific information such as project description and details to illustrate the scope of the project.\n\n<strong>E. DATA NOTES </strong>\n\n<strong>Reporting Update</strong>\nSignificant data and systems improvements are underway to produce a more accurate quarterly pipeline, so the data may change at any time. Weekly and monthly data on Planning Applications and Building Permits can be accessed via the City's Open Data Portal.\n\n<strong>Change in Status Definitions</strong>\nThe following changes have been made in status definitions since the 2022 Q1 Pipeline Report to align the Quarterly Pipeline Reports with other Housing Reports (Housing Inventory and Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) Annual Progress)  <br>\n<strong> (1) Construction: </strong> projects that are authorized for construction deemed to be in the construction stage. A project is considered to be authorized for construction if it has:\no\tan issued full building permit, OR<br>\no\tan issued site permit with an approved first construction document<br>\nPast definition: projects that had their first inspection were deemed to be in the construction stage.<br>\n<strong> (2) Building Permit Issued: </strong> includes projects that have an issued site permit but don\u2019t yet have their first construction document. Housing units for these projects are not yet counted toward RHNA progress.<br>\nPast definition: included projects with any type of permit (site or full building permit) in the issued status.\n\nA data dictionary can be downloaded from the following link: \nhttps://sfplanninggis.s3.amazonaws.com/PipelineDataDictionary_10262022.xlsx", "attribution": "City and County of San Francisco, City Planning Department", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-12-01T02:41:39.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-12-01T02:26:46.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-12-01T02:41:39.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-12-01T02:41:27.000Z", "columns_name": ["NET_GSF", "PLANNER", "SPONSOR", "CONTACT", "CONTACTPH", "DA", "LEGALIZATION", "ADU", "PD", "SD22", "NHOOD_37", "NHOOD_41", "ZONING", "HEIGHT_BUL", "PDA", "SUD", "PLANS", "Longitude", "Latitude", "YEAR", "QTR", "YEAR_QTR", "Lat/Long", "CIE_EXIST", "CIE", "CIENET", "MED_EXIST", "MED", "MEDNET", "MIPS_EXIST", "MIPS", "MIPSNET", "PDR_EXIST", "PDR", "PDRNET", "RET_EXIST", "RET", "RETNET", "Current Supervisor Districts", "Analysis Neighborhoods", "ObjectID", "Current Police Districts", "SF Find Neighborhoods", "Neighborhoods", "State Density ALL", "LANDUSE", "BLKLOT", "VISIT_EXIST", "VISIT", "VISITNET", "HOTEL_ROOM_EXIST", "HOTEL_ROOM_PROP", "NAMEADDR", "HOTEL_ROOM_NET", "Entitled", "BESTSTAT", "BESTDATE", "UNITS", "TCOCFC_DATE", "TCOCFC_UNITS", "UNITSNET", "Pipeline_Units", "AFFORDABLENET", "Aff_Projection", "SECTION415", "AFF_TARGET", "TENURE_TYPE", "CASENO", "BPAPPLNO", "DESCRIPT", "DBIDESC", "TOTAL_GSF"], "columns_field_name": ["net_gsf", "planner", "sponsor", "contact", "contactph", "da", "legalization", "adu", "pd", "sd22", "nhood_37", "nhood_41", "zoning", "height_bul", "pda", "sud", "plans", "longitude", "latitude", "year", "qtr", "year_qtr", "lat_long", "cie_exist", "cie", "cienet", "med_exist", "med", "mednet", "mips_exist", "mips", "mipsnet", "pdr_exist", "pdr", "pdrnet", "ret_exist", "ret", "retnet", ":@computed_region_26cr_cadq", ":@computed_region_ajp5_b2md", "objectid", ":@computed_region_qgnn_b9vv", ":@computed_region_6qbp_sg9q", ":@computed_region_jwn9_ihcz", "state_density_all", "landuse", "blklot", "visit_exist", "visit", "visitnet", "hotel_room_exist", "hotel_room_prop", "nameaddr", "hotel_room_net", "entitled", "beststat", "bestdate", "units", "tcocfc_date", "tcocfc_units", "unitsnet", "pipeline_units", "affordablenet", "aff_projection", "section415", "aff_target", "tenure_type", "caseno", "bpapplno", "descript", "dbidesc", "total_gsf"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Checkbox", "Checkbox", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Point", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Checkbox", "Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "This column was automatically created in order to record in what polygon from the dataset 'Current Supervisor Districts' (26cr-cadq) the point in column 'lat_long' is located.
