SUMMARY</strong>\nCase information on COVID-19 Laboratory testing. This data includes a daily count of test results reported, and how many of those were positive, negative, and indeterminate. Reported tests include tests with a positive, negative or indeterminate result. Indeterminate results, which could not conclusively determine whether COVID-19 virus was present, are not included in the calculation of percent positive. Testing for the novel coronavirus is available through commercial, clinical, and hospital laboratories, as well as the SFDPH Public Health Laboratory.\n\nTests are de-duplicated by an individual and date. This means that if a person gets tested multiple times on different dates in the last 30 days, all of those individual tests will be included in this data as individual tests (on each specimen collection date).\n\n<strong>Total positive test results is not equal to the total number of COVID-19 cases in San Francisco.</strong> Each positive test result is investigated. During this investigation, some test results are found to be for persons living outside of San Francisco and some are duplicates of previously received positive results. These are not included in the total San Francisco COVID-19 case count. Additionally, investigation of positive test results might not be completed on the day of receipt; new cases will be added to the total case count after full investigation and verification. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nLaboratory test volume and positivity for COVID-19 is based on electronic laboratory test reports. Deduplication, quality assurance measures and other data verification processes maximize accuracy of laboratory test information.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nDue to the high degree of variation in the time needed to complete tests by different labs there is a delay in this reporting. On March 24 the Health Officer ordered all labs in the City to report complete COVID-19 testing information to the local and state health departments. In order to track trends over time, a data user can analyze this data by \"result_date\" and see how the count of reported results and positivity rate have changed over time.\n\n<strong>E.

{"resource": {"name": "Law Enforcement Dispatched Calls for Service: Closed", "id": "2zdj-bwza", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>  \nDispatched Calls-For-Service \u2013 Closed Calls includes all calls for service which generate a record in the Department of Emergency Management's Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System, and typically have a law enforcement unit dispatched to the location. Calls originate from the public via calls to the 911 call center or from law enforcement officers in the field upon viewing an incident (\u2018On-View\u2019). The Closed Calls dataset includes only calls for service that have been closed, and is updated every 24 hours, to include the initial call type, final call type and call disposition. Not all Calls for Service generate a Police Incident Report, so data does not directly correlate to the Police Incidents Report dataset. All relevant time intervals are also included. Dataset contains calls handled by law enforcement which can include Police, MTA parking enforcement, the Sheriff\u2019s Office, and others. Some Calls for Service data is suppressed, due to the nature of the call and privacy concerns related to the incident. \n\nPlease refer to the <u><a href=\"https://datasf.gitbook.io/datasf-dataset-explainers/law-enforcement-dispatched-calls-for-service\"> Dispatched Calls for Service Explainer </a></u> for full documentation\n\n<strong>B.

Speed limits are indicated primarily for streets that have speeds greater than 25 MPH, unless the speed limit has been changed from a higher speed or a speed survey has been conducted to enforce the de facto speed limit of 25 MPH. 25 MPH is the de fact speed limit for most residential and commercial streets, and apply to streets on this map denoted by a 0 MPH label. Alleys narrower than 25 feet can have de facto speed limits of 15 MPH. \n\nB. METHODOLOGY  Speed limit legislation information is taken from MTAB legislation and in some cases directives from engineers in the 5212 classification.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset represents probable and confirmed mpox cases per CDC case definitions among San Francisco residents reported to the San Francisco Department of Public Health. Data are lagged by 4 days, based on the most recent date a case is received by the source system.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCase information is based on confirmed or probable positive laboratory tests reported to the San Francisco Department of Public Health. Processes to provide quality assurance and other data verification are completed before the data are reported.\n\nThese data may not be immediately available for recently reported cases because of the time needed to process tests and validate cases. Data are continually updated to maximize completeness of information and reporting on San Francisco residents with confirmed or probable mpox.\n\nTo ensure data privacy, we suppress data when cumulative counts are between 1-4. The exception to this rule is for the response option \u201cUnknown\u201d which does not provide any identifying information. If only one response option has a count <5 we also suppress the response option with the second lowest count (including \u201cUnknown\u201d or a response option with a count of 0). If the second lowest response option is 0, both response options will display \u201c<5\u201d. If the second lowest response option is a number greater than 0 both response options will display \u201c< [sum of two lowest counts]\u201d.\n\nData notes for population characteristic types are listed below.\n\n<u> Race/ethnicity</u>\n* The response option \"Other\" is categorized by the source system, and the response option \"Unknown\" refers to a lack of data.\n\n<u> Gender</u>\n* The response option \"Other\" is categorized by the source system, and the response option \"Unknown\" refers to a lack of data.\n\n<u> Sexual orientation</u>\n* The response option \"Other\" is categorized by the source system, and the response option \"Unknown/Declined\" refers to a lack of data or those who did not disclose their sexual orientation.\n* The response option \u201cGay, Lesbian, or Same-Gender Loving\u201d is a standard reporting option and cannot be split into individual categories. This is a limitation of the data from the source system.\n\n<u> Sexual contact during incubation period</u>\n* We track whether mpox cases had sexual contact during the 21 days prior to symptom(s) onset. This timeframe is the incubation period.\n* The response option \"Unknown/Declined\" refers to a lack of data or those who did not disclose their sexual contact history.\n\nFor convenience, we provide <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/4qbq-hvtt\"> the 2020 5-year American Community Survey population estimates</a>.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates to the data are made through automated and manual processes Monday through Friday.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset shows total cases (probable and confirmed) by population characteristics. Filter the \u201ccharacteristic_type\u201d column to explore a topic area. Then, the \u201ccharacteristic_group\u201d column shows each group or category within that topic area and the total count of cases identified within that population subgroup.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-01-04T17:41:13.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-09-16T17:16:48.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-01-04T17:41:13.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-01-04T15:00:54.000Z", "columns_name": ["data_as_of", "cases_suppressed_reason", "max_received_date", "percent_of_all_SF_cases", "population_estimate", "characteristic_type", "total_cases", "characteristic_group", "data_loaded_at"], "columns_field_name": ["data_as_of", "cases_suppressed_reason", "max_received_date", "percent_of_all_sf_cases", "population_estimate", "characteristic_type", "total_cases", "characteristic_group", "data_loaded_at"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Calendar date"], "columns_description": ["Timestamp when the record (row) was last updated in the source system", "Case totals between 1 and 4 will be suppressed to protect data privacy (displayed as \"< 5 cases\").

The goal was to \u201cprovide in the downtown quality open space in sufficient quantity and variety to meet the needs of downtown workers, residents and visitors.\u201d (See Planning Code Section 138 for regulations). Since then, project sponsors for residential projects may provide POPOS instead of their required open spaces in the Downtown Residential (DTR) and Eastern Neighborhoods (Section 135 of the Planning Code).

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis data set reports key performance metrics for departments and programs in the City and County of San Francisco.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCity departments report updates about their key metrics to the Controller\u2019s Office. The Controller's Office uses an online application to collect and organize this data. Departments update most metrics once or twice each year. Some metrics may not display data for every year.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nMost metrics update twice each year. Updates with results for the first 6 months of each fiscal year are published in the spring, typically between April and May. Updates with results for each full fiscal year are published in the fall, typically in November.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nEach row represents one metric and one fiscal year for a department, with multiple values for each fiscal year. Some metrics do not include values for all fields or fiscal years. Some results for the latest fiscal year are unavailable because of known lags in reporting. Users should review any data notes reported for each row for guidance about interpreting values. All values are reported as numbers without formatting, but the column [Measure Data Type] describes the intended format. For example, a value appearing as \u201c0.50\u201d with [Measure Data Type] reported as \u201cPercent\u201d should be displayed as \u201c50%\u201d.\n\n<strong>E. DATA NOTES</strong>\nDecember 1, 2022: The Controller\u2019s Office is in the process of correcting a data system issue affecting historical performance data for the Department of Public Works and the Department of Sanitation and Streets for Fiscal Year 2017-2018, Fiscal Year 2018-2019, and Fiscal Year 2019-2020.

Tracking of construction and entitlement activity based on data from Department of Building Inspection's Permit Tracking System and the Planning Department's Project & Permit Tracking System, processed quarterly. For more information please see http://sfplanning.org/pipeline-report\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe dataset is created by combining projects data from the City Planning Department and permit data from the Building Inspection Department to create a quarterly snapshot that shows when a project is filed to construction.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe Development Pipeline is updated as a quarterly snapshot of the construction development in the City of San Francisco.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nEach row or record is a project or permit. They are fitted with information such as address, block lot, project case number and spatial data that allow users to find the specific project. Each row also contains project specific information such as project description and details to illustrate the scope of the project.\n\n<strong>E. DATA NOTES </strong>\n\n<strong>Reporting Update</strong>\nSignificant data and systems improvements are underway to produce a more accurate quarterly pipeline, so the data may change at any time. Weekly and monthly data on Planning Applications and Building Permits can be accessed via the City's Open Data Portal.\n\n<strong>Change in Status Definitions</strong>\nThe following changes have been made in status definitions since the 2022 Q1 Pipeline Report to align the Quarterly Pipeline Reports with other Housing Reports (Housing Inventory and Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) Annual Progress)  <br>\n<strong> (1) Construction: </strong> projects that are authorized for construction deemed to be in the construction stage. A project is considered to be authorized for construction if it has:\no\tan issued full building permit, OR<br>\no\tan issued site permit with an approved first construction document<br>\nPast definition: projects that had their first inspection were deemed to be in the construction stage.<br>\n<strong> (2) Building Permit Issued: </strong> includes projects that have an issued site permit but don\u2019t yet have their first construction document. Housing units for these projects are not yet counted toward RHNA progress.<br>\nPast definition: included projects with any type of permit (site or full building permit) in the issued status.\n\nA data dictionary can be downloaded from the following link: \nhttps://sfplanninggis.s3.amazonaws.com/PipelineDataDictionary_10262022.xlsx", "attribution": "City and County of San Francisco, City Planning Department", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-02-27T21:02:38.000Z", "createdAt": "2023-02-27T20:55:59.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-02-27T21:02:38.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-27T21:02:19.000Z", "columns_name": ["PD", "Lat_Long", "YEAR_QTR", "QTR", "Latitude", "Longitude", "PLANS", "SUD", "PDA", "HEIGHT_BUL", "ZONING", "NHOOD_41", "NHOOD_37", "SD22", "State Density ALL", "ADU", "DA", "CONTACTPH", "CONTACT", "SPONSOR", "PLANNER", "HOTEL_ROOM_NET", "HOTEL_ROOM_PROP", "HOTEL_ROOM_EXIST", "VISIT", "VISIT_EXIST", "RETNET", "RET", "RET_EXIST", "PDRNET", "PDR_EXIST", "MIPSNET", "MIPS", "MIPS_EXIST", "MED_EXIST", "CIENET", "CIE", "NET_GSF", "TOTAL_GSF", "BPAPPLNO", "CASENO", "AFF_TARGET", "SECTION415", "Aff_Projection", "AFFORDABLENET", "Pipeline_Units", "UNITSNET", "TCOCFC_UNITS", "TCOCFC_DATE", "UNITS", "BESTDATE", "BESTSTAT", "NAMEADDR", "BLKLOT", "LANDUSE", "Recreation and Parks Properties", "Analysis Neighborhoods", "Current Supervisor Districts", "Current Police Districts", "Neighborhoods", "DBIDESC", "VISITNET", "Entitled", "MEDNET", "ObjectID", "LEGALIZATION", "TENURE_TYPE", "CIE_EXIST", "DESCRIPT", "PDR", "MED", "YEAR"], "columns_field_name": ["pd", "lat_long", "year_qtr", "qtr", "latitude", "longitude", "plans", "sud", "pda", "height_bul", "zoning", "nhood_41", "nhood_37", "sd22", "state_density_all", "adu", "da", "contactph", "contact", "sponsor", "planner", "hotel_room_net", "hotel_room_prop", "hotel_room_exist", "visit", "visit_exist", "retnet", "ret", "ret_exist", "pdrnet", "pdr_exist", "mipsnet", "mips", "mips_exist", "med_exist", "cienet", "cie", "net_gsf", "total_gsf", "bpapplno", "caseno", "aff_target", "section415", "aff_projection", "affordablenet", "pipeline_units", "unitsnet", "tcocfc_units", "tcocfc_date", "units", "bestdate", "beststat", "nameaddr", "blklot", "landuse", ":@computed_region_bz92_g22m", ":@computed_region_ajp5_b2md", ":@computed_region_26cr_cadq", ":@computed_region_qgnn_b9vv", ":@computed_region_jwn9_ihcz", "dbidesc", "visitnet", "entitled", "mednet", "objectid", "legalization", "tenure_type", "cie_exist", "descript", "pdr", "med", "year"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Point", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Checkbox", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Checkbox", "Number", "Number", "Checkbox", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "This column was automatically created in order to record in what polygon from the dataset 'Recreation and Parks Properties' (bz92-g22m) the point in column 'lat_long' is located.

An \u201cinterested party\u201d is a person who is a party, participant or agent of a party or participant to certain types of proceedings before the official in question. Those proceedings are limited to administrative enforcement proceedings and proceedings regarding permits, licenses, or other entitlements for use. A party to such a proceeding is someone who files an application for a license, permit, or entitlement for use or is the subject of the administrative enforcement. A participant in such a proceeding is someone who is not a party to the proceeding but who actively supports or opposes a particular decision in the proceeding and has a financial interest in the decision. An agent is someone who represents a party or a participant in such a proceeding.\n\nThe filing deadline for Form SFEC-3610(b) depends on the circumstances under which the behested payment was made.\n\nIf the behested payment was made while the proceeding involving the interested party is pending before the official, then the form must be filed within thirty days of the payment being made. If there is a series of behested payments, the form is due within 30 days of the payment that makes the total $1,000 or more.\n\nIf the behested payment was made within six months following the date on which a final decision was made in the proceeding involving the interested party, then the form must be filed within thirty days of the payment. If there is a series of behested payments, the form is due within 30 days of the payment that makes the total $1,000 or more.\n\nFinally, if the behested payment was made in the 12 months prior to the commencement of the proceeding involving the interested party, the form is due within 30 days of the date the official knew or should have known that the source of the behested payment became an interested party.\n\nEach row on this table represents the contents of a Form SFEC-3610(b) filed with the Ethics Commission.

For some elections, separate pamphlets were created for each voting district or a combination of each voting district and political party, and there is no singular representative pamphlet which includes all of the candidates for that election. As a result, the hard copies of the various pamphlets were bound together to represent that particular election, and this resulted in extra-large digitized versions. \n\nBecause the PDF files of the voter pamphlets are images instead of text, they cannot be searched electronically. San Francisco Public Library staff developed the San Francisco Ballot Propositions Database to provide keyword access to San Francisco propositions, pass/fail outcomes and other information, and links to the full-text PDF Voter Information Pamphlet.\n \n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\n\nThis dataset is updated when the final election results from the <a href=\"https://sfelections.sfgov.org/results\">San Francisco Department of Elections</a> are available.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\n\nThis dataset contains the number and percentage of ballots cast, percentage required to pass, as well as pass/fail outcomes, the full text of each proposition, and a link to a PDF version of the Voter Information Pamphlet for that election, if available.", "attribution": "San Francisco Public Library", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2021-03-05T23:23:26.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-12-23T19:42:09.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2021-03-05T23:23:26.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2021-03-05T23:23:25.000Z", "columns_name": ["Description", "Voter_Information_Pamphlet", "Percent_Vote_Yes", "Kind", "Month", "Vote_Counts_Yes", "Percent_Required_To_Pass", "PROPTitle", "Year", "Date", "Vote_Counts_No", "Percent_Vote_No", "PASS_FAIL", "HowPlaced", "Day", "PROPLetter"], "columns_field_name": ["description", "voter_information_pamphlet", "percent_vote_yes", "kind", "month", "vote_counts_yes", "percent_required_to_pass", "proptitle", "year", "date", "vote_counts_no", "percent_vote_no", "pass_fail", "howplaced", "day", "propletter"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "URL", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Proposition Text", "link to Voter Information Pamphlet", "Percentage of Yes votes", "Type of Measure", "Month", "Number of Yes votes", "Percent required to pass", "Proposition Title", "Year", "Date", "Number of No votes", "Percentage of No votes", "Outcome", "How it got on the ballot", "Day", "Proposition Letter"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2021-03-05T23:23:26.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["politics", "economy", "infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "City Management and Ethics", "domain_tags": ["ballot measure", "elections", "propositions"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Department-Metrics_Publishing-Department", "value": "Public Library"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Publishing-frequency", "value": "As needed"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Data-change-frequency", "value": "As needed"}, {"key": "Detailed-Descriptive_Geographic-unit", "value": "Not applicable"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.sfgov.org", "license": "Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License"}, "permalink": "https://data.sfgov.org/d/88s2-6ua9", "link": "https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/San-Francisco-Ballot-Propositions-Database-Histori/88s2-6ua9", "owner": {"id": "2u3r-hdus", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Freya Channing"}, "creator": {"id": "2u3r-hdus", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Freya Channing"}}

{"resource": {"name": "Traffic Crashes Resulting in Injury: Parties Involved", "id": "8gtc-pjc6", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis table contains all parties involved in a traffic crash resulting in an injury in the City of San Francisco. Fatality year-to-date crash data is obtained from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OME) death records, and only includes those cases that meet the San Francisco Vision Zero Fatality Protocol maintained by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH), San Francisco Police Department (SFPD), and San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). Injury crash data is obtained from SFPD\u2019s Interim Collision System for 2018 to YTD, Crossroads Software Traffic Collision Database (CR) for years 2013-2017 and the Statewide Integrated Transportation Record System (SWITRS) maintained by the California Highway Patrol for all years prior to 2013. Only crashes with valid geographic information are mapped. All geocodable crash data is represented on the simplified San Francisco street centerline model maintained by the Department of Public Works (SFDPW). Collision injury data is queried and aggregated on a quarterly basis. Crashes occurring at complex intersections with multiple roadways are mapped onto a single point and injury and fatality crashes occurring on highways are excluded.\n\nThe crash, party, and victim tables have a relational structure. The traffic crashes table contains information on each crash, one record per crash. The party table contains information from all parties involved in the crashes, one record per party. Parties are individuals involved in a traffic crash including drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and parked vehicles. The victim table contains information about each party injured in the collision, including any passengers. Injury severity is included in the victim table. \n\nFor example, a crash occurs (1 record in the crash table) that involves a driver party and a pedestrian party (2 records in the party table). Only the pedestrian is injured and thus is the only victim (1 record in the victim table). \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nTraffic crash injury data is collected from the California Highway Patrol 555 Crash Report as submitted by the police officer within 30 days after the crash occurred. All fields that match the SWITRS data schema are programmatically extracted, de-identified, geocoded, and loaded into TransBASE. See Section D below for details regarding TransBASE. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nAfter review by SFPD and SFDPH staff, the data is made publicly available approximately a month after the end of the previous quarter (May for Q1, August for Q2, November for Q3, and February for Q4). \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis data is being provided as public information as defined under San Francisco and California public records laws. SFDPH, SFMTA, and SFPD cannot limit or restrict the use of this data or its interpretation by other parties in any way. Where the data is communicated, distributed, reproduced, mapped, or used in any other way, the user should acknowledge TransBASE.sfgov.org as the source of the data, provide a reference to the original data source where also applicable, include the date the data was pulled, and note any caveats specified in the associated metadata documentation provided. However, users should not attribute their analysis or interpretation of this data to the City of San Francisco. While the data has been collected and/or produced for the use of the City of San Francisco, it cannot guarantee its accuracy or completeness. Accordingly, the City of San Francisco, including SFDPH, SFMTA, and SFPD make no representation as to the accuracy of the information or its suitability for any purpose and disclaim any liability for omissions or errors that may be contained therein. As all data is associated with methodological assumptions and limitations, the City recommends that users review methodological documentation associated with the data prior to its analysis,

Developers must file five forms with the Ethics Commission over the course of about a year disclosing donations to nonprofit organizations that have contacted City officials about their project. The first form is due within 30 days of certification of an Environmental Impact Report (\"EIR\") by a local agency or, if the project relies on a program EIR, within 30 days of the adoption of a final environmental determination under the California Environmental Quality Act. Disclosure is not required for a residential development project with four or fewer dwelling units. A disclosure report must be completed and filed by the developer of any \"major project.\" A major project is a real estate development project located in the City and County of San Francisco with estimated construction costs exceeding $1,000,000 where either: The Planning Commission or any other local lead agency certifies an Environmental Impact Review (\"EIR\") for the project under the California Environmental Quality Act (\"CEQA\"); or The project relies on a program EIR and the Planning Department, Planning Commission, or any other local lead agency adopts any final environmental determination under CEQA. (See below to determine when a final environmental determination is adopted.)A major project does not include a residential development project with four or fewer dwelling units. For purposes of this filing requirement, a \"developer\" includes the individual or entity that is the project sponsor responsible for filing a completed Environmental Evaluation Application (\"EEA\") with the Planning Department (or other lead agency) under CEQA.

{"resource": {"name": "Campaign Finance - Summary Totals", "id": "9ggq-m8hp", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset contains current summary information for electronically filed FPPC campaign forms. The columns in this dataset correspond to the figures reported on the summary page of FPPC forms 450, 460, 461, and 465. Refer to the <a href=\"https://fppc.ca.gov/forms.html\">FPPC Forms represented in this dataset</a>.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCommittees file campaign statements with the Ethics Commission on a periodic basis. Those statements are stored with the Commission's provider. Data is generally presented as-filed by committees.\nIf a committee files an amendment, the data from that filing completely replaces the original and any prior amendments in the filing sequence.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nEach night starting at midnight Pacific time a script runs to check for new filings with the Commission's database, and updates this dataset with transactions from new filings. The update process can take a variable amount of time to complete. Viewing or downloading this dataset while the update is running may result in incomplete data, therefore it is highly recommended to view or download this data before midnight or after 8am.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nTransactions from rejected and superseded filings are not included in this dataset. Transactions from many different FPPC forms are combined in this dataset, refer to the column \"Form Type\" to differentiate transaction types.\n\nA row with no value in the SyncFlag column indicates a paper filing amended an electronic filing. The SFEC is working on how to automatically deal with these cases.\n\nProperties suffixed with \"-nid\" can be used to join the data between Filers, Filings, and Transaction datasets.\n\nRefer to the <a href=\"https://sfethics.org/disclosures/campaign-finance-disclosure/campaign-finance-disclosure-data\">Ethics Commission's webpage</a> for more information.\n\n<strong>RELATED DATASETS</strong>\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Campaign-Finance-San-Francisco-Campaign-Filers/4c8t-ngau\">San Francisco Campaign Filers</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Campaign-Finance-Filings-Received-by-SFEC/qizs-bwft\">Filings Received by SFEC</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Campaign-Finance-Summary-Totals/9ggq-m8hp\">Summary Totals</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Campaign-Finance-Transactions/pitq-e56w\">Transactions</a></li>\n</ul>", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-03-27T08:15:51.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-03-01T23:23:00.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-10-03T20:24:20.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-03-27T08:15:51.000Z", "columns_name": ["Schedule I Line 2", "Schedule I Line 1", "Schedule H Line 1", "Schedule E Line 1", "Schedule D Line 1", "Schedule C Line 3", "Schedule B1 Line 3", "Schedule A Line 1", "Line 15 Col A", "Line 10 Col B", "Line 10 Col A", "Line 8 Col B", "Line 5 Col B", "Line 4 Col B", "Line 3 Col B", "Line 3 Col A", "Filing Date", "Form Type", "Schedule D Line 2", "Schedule B1 Line 1", "Line 4 Col A", "Latest Filing Activity Nid", "Filing Nid", "Filing Start Date", "Schedule F Line 3", "Line 20 Col A", "Line 9 Col A", "Filer Nid", "Filer Type", "Schedule E Line 4", "Schedule E Line 2", "Schedule C Line 2", "Schedule C Line 1", "Line 18 Col A", "Line 12 Col A", "Line 7 Col B", "Line 6 Col B", "Line 6 Col A", "Line 5 Col A", "Schedule D Line 3", "Line 16 Col A", "Schedule H Line 3", "Schedule A Line 2", "Line 21 Col A", "Line 7 Col A", "Line 2 Col A", "Line 1 Col A", "Schedule H Line 2", "Schedule B1 Line 2", "Schedule A Line 3", "Line 22A Col A", "Line 14 Col A", "Line 13 Col A", "Schedule F Line 2", "Schedule E Line 3", "Filing Id Number", "Line 1 Col B", "Data Loaded At", "Line 11 Col B", "Filer Name", "Schedule F Line 1", "Data As Of", "Line 9 Col B", "Schedule I Line 3", "Line 17 Col A", "Line 20 Col B", "Line 22C Col A", "Line 21 Col B", "Sync Flag", "Line 19 Col A", "Line 11 Col A", "Line 8 Col A", "FPPC Id", "Filing End Date", "Line 2 Col B", "Schedule I Line 4", "Line 22B Col A", "Filing Type"], "columns_field_name": ["schedulei_line_2", "schedulei_line_1", "scheduleh_line_1", "schedulee_line_1", "scheduled_line_1", "schedulec_line_3", "scheduleb1_line_3", "schedulea_line_1", "line_15_col_a", "line_10_col_b", "line_10_col_a", "line_8_col_b", "line_5_col_b", "line_4_col_b", "line_3_col_b", "line_3_col_a", "filing_date", "form_type", "scheduled_line_2", "scheduleb1_line_1", "line_4_col_a", "filing_activity_nid", "filing_nid", "start_date", "schedulef_line_3", "line_20_col_a", "line_9_col_a", "filer_nid", "filer_type", "schedulee_line_4", "schedulee_line_2", "schedulec_line_2", "schedulec_line_1", "line_18_col_a", "line_12_col_a", "line_7_col_b", "line_6_col_b", "line_6_col_a", "line_5_col_a", "scheduled_line_3", "line_16_col_a", "scheduleh_line_3", "schedulea_line_2", "line_21_col_a", "line_7_col_a", "line_2_col_a", "line_1_col_a", "scheduleh_line_2", "scheduleb1_line_2", "schedulea_line_3", "line_22a_col_a", "line_14_col_a", "line_13_col_a", "schedulef_line_2", "schedulee_line_3", "filing_id_number", "line_1_col_b", "data_loaded_at", "line_11_col_b", "filer_name", "schedulef_line_1", "data_as_of", "line_9_col_b", "schedulei_line_3", "line_17_col_a", "line_20_col_b", "line_22c_col_a", "line_21_col_b", "sync_flag", "line_19_col_a", "line_11_col_a", "line_8_col_a", "fppc_id", "end_date", "line_2_col_b", "schedulei_line_4", "line_22b_col_a", "filing_type"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Checkbox", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Form 460 Only -

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset is derived from <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Parcels-Active-and-Retired/acdm-wktn\">parcels</a> and several other overlay administrative boundaries (listed below). The dataset was developed by DataSF as a convenience for matching parcels to districts where appropriate. This can be simpler than running a geospatial process every time you want to join parcels to a boundary. The districts provided here run along streets and are non-overlapping so that the parcels will be contained within a single district.\n\nThe boundaries included are:\n1. <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Analysis-Neighborhoods/p5b7-5n3h\">Analysis Neighborhoods</a>\n2. <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Current-Supervisor-Districts/8nkz-x4ny\">Supervisor Districts</a>\n3. <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Current-Police-Districts/wkhw-cjsf\">Police Districts</a>\n4. <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Planning-Districts/ttns-6zj3\">Planning Districts</a>\n\n<strong>B.

HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nYou can use this dataset to match to administrative districts provided here to datasets that contain a parcel number.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset contains the current San Francisco Board of Supervisor district boundaries approved by the <u><a href=\"https://sf.gov/public-body/2020-census-redistricting-task-force#:~:text=The%20Redistricting%20Task%20Force%20consists,following%20each%20federal%20decennial%20census.\">San Francisco Redistricting Task Force</a></u>. This dataset was created in April 2022 following redistricting based on the 2020 Decennial Census. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis dataset will be updated to reflect the most current Supervisor District boundaries available. It currently reflects the same boundaries found in <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/f2zs-jevy\">Supervisor Districts (2022)</a></u>. More information on how this was created can be found in the datasets by year: <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/f2zs-jevy\">Supervisor Districts (2022)</a></u> and <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/keex-zmn4\">Supervisor Districts (2012)</a></u>\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nSupervisor District boundaries are updated every 10 years following the federal Decennial Census. The Supervisor District boundaries reflected in this dataset will be manually updated after the next Decennial Census in 2030.\n\nThe dataset is also manually updated as new members of the Board of Supervisors are elected or appointed. The most recent manual update date is reflected in the 'data_as_of' field. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset can be joined to other datasets for analysis and reporting at the Supervisor District level. \n\nIf you are building an automated reporting pipeline using Socrata API access, we recommend using this dataset if you would like the boundaries to automatically update after each decennial census to reflect the most recent Supervisor District boundaries. If you'd like your boundaries to remain static, see the <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/f2zs-jevy\">Supervisor Districts (2022)</a></u> dataset. \n\n<strong>E.

{"resource": {"name": "Supplier Contracts", "id": "cqi5-hm2d", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "The San Francisco Controller's Office maintains a database of contracts and payments made to Suppliers (vendors, contractors and grantees). The Supplier Contracts shown here include all fully executed, expenditure-only contracts, including City contracts for commodities, professional and general services, and construction from fiscal year 2018 forward, based upon the contracting departments' inputs. This data set includes both departmental and citywide contracts.\n\nThis data is presented on the Supplier Contracts report hosted at http://openbook.sfgov.org, and is also available in CSV format, which lists summary data by contract. We have removed sensitive contracts and information from this data in order to balance disclosure requirements and protected/confidential data. For example, we have removed contracts related to certain legal proceedings that are exempt from disclosure.  New data is added on a weekly basis.\n\n\nRevenue contracts, including concessions and rental income contracts, are not included in this data set; they are tracked in departmental subsystems and currently are not available in SF Open Book. For more information about Revenue Contracts, please contact the respective City Department that awards the contract, e.g. for Airport Concession Contracts, contact the San Francisco Airport Commission which maintains these records.\n\nCity Department spending may occur three ways: 1) from Contract to Purchase Order (i.e. a PO with an accounting Encumbrance) to Payment (i.e. an accounting Voucher), AKA On-Contract spending, 2) direct-to-Purchase Order (no contract, only a PO agreement and accounting Encumbrance) to Payment, and 3) Direct Voucher Payment (for limited one-time, non-recurring payments, e.g. a membership or a subscription).  Therefore, it is helpful to use both the Supplier Contracts and Supplier Payments reports on SFOpenBook, as well as on DataSF.\n\nThe data included in the Supplier Contracts dataset reflects supplier expenditure contracts that were awarded by City Departments after 7/1/2017, the date the City & County of San Francisco implemented the PeopleSoft Financial & Procurement System, as well as the remaining not-to-exceed contract authority for all supplier expenditure contracts that were still active along with their associated purchase order (PO) available, unexpended balances as of 7/1/2017. For partially used contract authority, the Contract Award Amount only includes the portion that was unutilized and available as of 7/1/2017, unless the Contract Award Amount was updated by the department after July 1, 2017. Contracts that were expired before 7/1/2017 as well as contracts that had no remaining contracting authority from which to issue new purchase orders were not converted or loaded into PeopleSoft. For information requests regarding the latter as well as for the portion of contract of authority used prior to 7/1/2017 for otherwise unexpired contract balances that were converted and still active as of 7/1/2017, please contact the City department(s) that issued the contract.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-03-20T12:35:50.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-02-20T21:32:27.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-03-20T12:35:44.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-03-20T12:35:50.000Z", "columns_name": ["Contract Title", "Contract Number", "Remaining Contract Award Amount", "Scope of Work", "Contract Type", "Contract Awarded Amount", "Purchasing Authority", "Purchase Orders Outstanding", "Term End Date", "Supplier Name", "Department", "Department Code", "Term Start Date", "Non-Profit", "Supplier Type", "project_team_lbe_status", "Supplier Name (Prime Contractor)", "Payments Made", "Sole Source"], "columns_field_name": ["contract_title", "contract_no", "remaining_amt", "scope_of_work", "contract_type", "agreed_amt", "purchasing_authority", "consumed_amt", "term_end_date", "project_team_supplier", "department", "department_code", "term_start_date", "non_profit", "project_team_constituent", "project_team_lbe_status", "prime_contractor", "pmt_amt", "sole_source_flg"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["The general description of goods or services provided", "A unique number assigned to the contract", "The remaining award amount on the contract", "The type of good or service provided by the project team member", "The type of contract", "The portion of the contract award allocated to the project team member", "The City legal or statutory authority permitting the contract", "The balance of outstanding purchase orders released against the contract", "The expiration date of the contract term", "The name of the prime contractor, subcontractor, or jont venture constituent performing work on the contract", "The name of the City department entering into the contract", "The three-digit code of the City department entering into the contract", "The start date of the contract term", "Indicates whether the supplier has been certified as a non-profit entity", "The type of supplier (prime contractor, subcontractor, or jont venture constituent) performing work on the contract", "", "The name of the prime contractor responsible for the contract", "The sum of payments from the City to the prime contractor, or from the prime contractor to a subcontractor", "Indicates whether the purchasing authority of the contract permits sole source purchases"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "currency", "currencyStyle": "USD", "precision": "2"}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "currency", "precision": "2", "align": "left"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "currency", "precision": "2", "align": "left"}, {"view": "date_ymd"}, {}, {}, {}, {"view": "date_ymd"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "currency", "precision": "2", "align": "left"}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-04-20T10:02:03.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["environment"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "City Management and Ethics", "domain_tags": ["award", "contract", "prime contractor", "procurement", "project team", "purchasing", "subcontractor", "supplier", "vendor"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Department-Metrics_Publishing-Department", "value": "Controller"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Publishing-frequency", "value": "Weekly"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Data-change-frequency", "value": "Daily"}, {"key": "Detailed-Descriptive_Geographic-unit", "value": "Not applicable"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.sfgov.org", "license": "Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License"}, "permalink": "https://data.sfgov.org/d/cqi5-hm2d", "link": "https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Supplier-Contracts/cqi5-hm2d", "owner": {"id": "9ufn-6bwh", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Alex Levitsky"}, "creator": {"id": "9ufn-6bwh", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Alex Levitsky"}}

SUMMARY</strong>\n\n<strong><i>Please note that the \"Data Last Updated\" date on this page denotes the most recent DataSF update and does not reflect the most recent update to this dataset. To confirm the completeness of this dataset please contact the District Attorney's office at <u><a href=\u201dmailto:districtattorney@sfgov.org\u201d>districtattorney@sfgov.org</a></u>.</strong></i>\n\nThis dataset includes information on every arrest that has been presented to the SFDA since 2011 and the \u201caction\u201d decision made by the office on each, based on data from the SFDA\u2019s internal case management system.\n\nAfter law enforcement has made an arrest for suspected criminal activity, the arresting agency presents its evidence to the District Attorney\u2019s Office to determine what, if any, charges can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. This prosecutorial decision to file or to reject arrest charges represents the first, and one of the most important, decisions of the District Attorney\u2019s Office. In addition to either filing new charges or declining to file charges (\u201cdischarging\u201d the arrest), the prosecutor may also take other actions, such as initiating a motion to revoke probation or parole, referring the case back to the arresting agency for further investigation, or referring the case to another criminal justice agency.\n\nMore information about this dataset can be found under the \u201cDistrict Attorney Actions on Arrests Presented\u201d section on the <u><a href=\"https://sfdistrictattorney.org/policy/data-dashboards/#sfda-actions-on-arrests-presented\">Data Dashboards page</a></u>\n\n<strong><i>Disclaimer: The San Francisco District Attorney's Office does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information as the data is subject to change as modifications and updates are completed.</strong></i>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\n\nWhen an arrest is presented to the District Attorney\u2019s office, relevant data is manually entered into the District Attorney Office's case management system. Data reports are pulled from this system on a semi-regular basis, cleaned, anonymized, and added to Open Data.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\n\nWe strive to update this dataset at the beginning of every week.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Cases by Geography Over Time", "id": "d2ef-idww", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset contains COVID-19 positive confirmed cases aggregated by several different geographic areas and by day. COVID-19 cases are mapped to the residence of the individual and shown on the date the positive test was collected. In addition, 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) population estimates are included to calculate the cumulative rate per 10,000 residents.\n\nDataset covers cases going back to 3/2/2020 when testing began. This data may not be immediately available for recently reported cases and data will change to reflect as information becomes available. Data updated daily.\n\nGeographic areas summarized are:\n1. <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Analysis-Neighborhoods/p5b7-5n3h\">Analysis Neighborhoods</a>\n2. <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Census-2010-Tracts-for-San-Francisco/rarb-5ahf\">Census Tracts</a>\n3. <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html\">Census Zip Code Tabulation Areas</a>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nAddresses from the COVID-19 case data are geocoded by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). Those addresses are spatially joined to the geographic areas. Counts are generated based on the number of address points that match each geographic area for a given date.\n\nThe 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) population estimates provided by the Census are used to create a cumulative rate which is equal to <i>([cumulative count up to that date] / [acs_population]) * 10000)</i> representing the number of total cases per 10,000 residents (as of the specified date).\n\nCOVID-19 case data undergo quality assurance and other data verification processes and are continually updated to maximize completeness and accuracy of information. This means data may change for previous days as information is updated.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nGeographic analysis is scripted by SFDPH staff and synced to this dataset daily at 05:00 Pacific Time.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nSan Francisco population estimates for geographic regions can be found in a <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/35v5-seg9\">view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset</a>. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS).\n\nThis dataset can be used to track the spread of COVID-19 throughout the city, in a variety of geographic areas. Note that the new cases column in the data represents the number of new cases confirmed in a certain area on the specified day, while the cumulative cases column is the cumulative total of cases in a certain area as of the specified date.\n\n<em>Privacy rules in effect</em>\nTo protect privacy, certain rules are in effect:\n1. Any area with a cumulative case count less than 10 are dropped for all days the cumulative count was less than 10. These will be null values.\n2. Once an area has a cumulative case count of 10 or greater, that area will have a new row of case data every day following.\n3. Cases are dropped altogether for areas where acs_population < 1000\n4. Deaths data are not included in this dataset for privacy reasons. The low COVID-19 death rate in San Francisco, along with other publicly available information on deaths, means that deaths data by geography and day is too granular and potentially risky. Read more in our <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-19-Data-Tracker-Publishing-Privacy-Guideline/9aj4-um47\">privacy guidelines</a>\n\n<em>Rate suppression in effect where counts lower than 20</em>\nRates are not calculated unless the cumulative case count is greater than or equal to 20. Rates are generally unstable at small numbers, so we avoid calculating them directly. We advise you to apply the same approach as this is best practice in epidemiology.\n\n<em>A note on Census ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)</em>\nZIP Code Tabulation Areas are spec", "attribution": "Department of Public Health - Population Health Division", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-03-27T12:08:14.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-07-17T18:49:47.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-03-27T12:07:50.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-03-27T12:08:14.000Z", "columns_name": ["data_loaded_at", "cumulative_confirmed_cases", "new_confirmed_cases", "acs_population", "specimen_collection_date", "id", "rate_of_cumulative_confirmed_cases", "data_as_of", "area_type"], "columns_field_name": ["data_loaded_at", "cumulative_confirmed_cases", "new_confirmed_cases", "acs_population", "specimen_collection_date", "id", "rate_of_cumulative_confirmed_cases", "data_as_of", "area_type"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Calendar date", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Timestamp when data entered the Socrata system", "The cumulative total cases in the area as of the specified date", "The count of new cases in the area on the specified date", "The population from the latest 5-year estimates from the American Community Survey (2015-2019)", "Date the positive test was collected for the confirmed cases ", "The identifier for the area type", "The rate of cases in the area, calculated as (count/acs_population) * 10000 which is a rate per 10,000 residents", "Timestamp for last update date in source system", "Type of geographic area, one of: Citywide, Census Tract, Analysis Neighborhood, or ZCTA (ZIP Code Tabulation Area)"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {"view": "date_ymd"}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2023-01-31T19:16:06.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "health", "public safety"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "COVID-19", "domain_tags": ["cases", "census tract", "covid", "covid-19", "mapping", "maps", "neighborhoods", "zip", "zip code"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Department-Metrics_Publishing-Department", "value": "Public Health"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Publishing-frequency", "value": "Daily"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Data-change-frequency", "value": "Daily"}, {"key": "Detailed-Descriptive_Geographic-unit", "value": "Other"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.sfgov.org", "license": "Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License"}, "permalink": "https://data.sfgov.org/d/d2ef-idww", "link": "https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-19-Cases-by-Geography-Over-Time/d2ef-idww", "owner": {"id": "dbag-6qd9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "OpenData"}, "creator": {"id": "dbag-6qd9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "OpenData"}}

SUMMARY</strong>\n\n<strong><i>Please note that the \"Data Last Updated\" date on this page denotes the most recent DataSF update and does not reflect the most recent update to this dataset. To confirm the completeness of this dataset please contact the District Attorney's office at <u><a href=\u201dmailto:districtattorney@sfgov.org\u201d>districtattorney@sfgov.org</a></u>.</strong></i>\n\nThis dataset includes information on all cases presented to the District Attorney\u2019s Office in which the office has taken action to prosecute a case, either by filing new criminal charges or by filing a motion to revoke probation or parole (MTR). This does not include cases in which the San Francisco Adult Probation Department or the state Division of Adult Parole Operations files a motion to revoke.\n\nFor cases in which SFDA files a new criminal charge, the most serious offense type is categorized as the most serious offense for which SFDA prosecuted the defendant. For cases in which SFDA files an MTR, the most serious offense is categorized as the most serious offense for which the person was initially prosecuted. This is because a filing of an MTR means that new criminal charges were not filed for the new arresting offense, but rather that the District Attorney\u2019s Office is seeking a new sanction as part of the sentence of a prior criminal conviction. For MTRs, the filing date is based on the date when SFDA filed the MTR for the new arrest.\n\nMore information about this dataset can be found under the \u201cCases Prosecuted\u201d section on the <u><a href=\"https://sfdistrictattorney.org/policy/data-dashboards/#cases-prosecuted\">Data Dashboards page</a></u>\n\n<strong><i>Disclaimer: The San Francisco District Attorney's Office does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information as the data is subject to change as modifications and updates are completed.</strong></i>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\n\nWhen District Attorney\u2019s Office takes action to prosecute a case, relevant data is manually entered into the District Attorney Office's case management system. Data reports are pulled from this system on a semi-regular basis, cleaned, anonymized, and added to Open Data.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\n\nWe strive to update this dataset at the beginning of every week. However, the creation of this dataset requires a manual pull from the Office's case management system and is dependent on staff availability.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\n\nPlease review the \u201cCases Prosecuted\u201d section on the <u><a href=\"https://sfdistrictattorney.org/policy/data-dashboards/#cases-prosecuted\">Data Dashboards page</a></u> for more information about this dataset.\n\n<strong>E.

SUMMARY</strong>\nCensus blocks with Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay water clipped out. Census blocks are the smallest geographic area for which the Bureau of the Census collects and tabulates decennial census data, are formed by streets, roads, railroads, streams and other bodies of water, other visible physical and cultural features, and the legal boundaries shown on Census Bureau maps. More information on the census tracts can be found <u><a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2011/07/what-are-census-blocks.html\">here</a></u>.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe boundaries are uploaded from TIGER/Line shapefiles provided by the <u><a href=\"https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php?year=2021&layergroup=Blocks+%282020%29\">U.S. Census Bureau</a></u> and clipped using the <u><a href=\"https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php?year=2021&layergroup=Water\">water boundaries</a></u> provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. \n \n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThis dataset is static. Changes to the census blocks are tracked in multiple datasets.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Vaccinations Given to SF Residents by Geography", "id": "ejrc-vnwu", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong> \nThis dataset represents the COVID-19 vaccinations given to residents of San Francisco summarized by the geographic region of their residential address. All vaccines given to SF residents are included, no matter where the vaccination took place (the vaccine may have been administered in San Francisco or outside of San Francisco).  \n\nData provides counts for residents who have received at least one dose, residents who have completed a primary vaccine series, residents who have received one or two monovalent (not bivalent) booster doses, and residents who have received a bivalent booster dose. A primary vaccine series is complete after an individual has received all intended doses of the initial series. There are one, two, and three dose primary vaccine series. \n \n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong> \nInformation on doses administered to those who live in San Francisco is from the <a href=\"https://cdph.ca.gov/CAIR\">California Immunization Registry (CAIR2)</a>, run by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The information on individuals\u2019 residential addresses is recorded in CAIR and are self-reported at the time of vaccine administration. San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) then runs additional processes to spatially match each address to a geographical region. \n\nIn order to estimate the percent of San Francisco residents vaccinated, we provide the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) population estimates for each analysis neighborhood.\n \n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> \nUpdated daily via automated process \n \n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong> \nSan Francisco population estimates for geographic regions can be found in a <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/35v5-seg9\">view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset</a>. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS). \n\nThis data is grouped by SF residents\u2019 analysis neighborhoods of residence. To query counts of individuals vaccinated by analysis neighborhood, filter to \"area_type\" = \u2018Analysis Neighborhood\u2019, and \"id\" will contain the analysis neighborhood name. To query summarized counts of all vaccinated individuals in San Francisco and whether the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) was able to match their residential address to a location, filter to \"area_type\" = \u2018Summary\u2019. \n\nTo count the number of individuals vaccinated (with any primary series dose), use the \"count_vaccinated\" column. To count the number of individuals vaccinated (with any primary series dose) by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH), use the \"count_vaccinated_by_dph\" column.  To count the number of individuals who have completed their primary vaccine series, use the \"count_series_completed\" column. To count the number of individuals who received one or two monovalent (not bivalent) boosters, use the \"count_received_booster\" and \"count_received_2nd_booster\" columns. To count the number of individuals who received at least one bivalent booster, use the \"count_received_bivalent_booster\" columns. \n\n<strong>E. ARCHIVED DATA</strong> \nA previous version of this dataset was archived on 10/27/2022.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset contains San Francisco Board of Supervisor district boundaries approved by the <u><a href=\"https://sf.gov/public-body/2020-census-redistricting-task-force#:~:text=The%20Redistricting%20Task%20Force%20consists,following%20each%20federal%20decennial%20census.\">San Francisco Redistricting Task Force</a></u> in April 2022 following redistricting based on the 2020 Decennial Census. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe dataset was created from the <u><a href=\"https://sfgov.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=57159538a9a3422a9d22ef75d66565b6\">final map</a></u> submitted by the San Francisco Redistricting Task Force. Boundaries in this map were decided using data from the 2020 Census on the number of people living in each census block in the City and County. This data includes the number of individuals incarcerated in facilities under the control of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation based on their last known residential address. This information is made available by the <u><a href=\"https://statewidedatabase.org/\">Statewide Database</a></u> based on U.S. Census Bureau Census Redistricting Data (P.L. 94-171).\n\nThese map boundaries were trimmed to align with the city and county's physical boundaries for greater usability. This trimming mainly consisted of excluding the water around the City and County from the boundaries.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nSupervisor District boundaries are updated every 10 years following the federal Decennial Census. The Supervisor Districts reflected in this dataset will remain unchanged until after the next Decennial Census in 2030. A new dataset will be created after the next Decennial Census and redistricting process are completed. \n\nThe dataset is manually updated as new members of the Board of Supervisors are elected or appointed. The most recent manual update date is reflected in the 'data_as_of' field. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset can be joined to other datasets for analysis and reporting at the Supervisor District level. \n\n<strong>E.

{"resource": {"name": "Mpox Vaccinations Given to SF Residents by Demographics", "id": "fk8q-nu3s", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>UPDATE 1/3/2023: Due to low case numbers, this page will no longer include vaccinations after 12/31/2022. </strong>\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY </strong>\nThis dataset represents doses of mpox vaccine (JYNNEOS) administered in California to residents of San Francisco ages 18 years or older. This dataset only includes doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine given on or after 5/1/2022. All vaccines given to people who live in San Francisco are included, no matter where the vaccination took place. The data are broken down by multiple demographic stratifications.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED </strong>\nInformation on doses administered to those who live in San Francisco is from the <a href=\"https://cdph.ca.gov/CAIR\">California Immunization Registry (CAIR2)</a>, run by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). Information on individuals\u2019 city of residence, age, race, ethnicity, and sex are recorded in CAIR2 and are self-reported at the time of vaccine administration. Because CAIR2 does not include information on sexual orientation, we pull information from the San Francisco Department of Public Health\u2019s  Epic Electronic Health Record (EHR). The populations represented in our Epic data and the CAIR2 data are different. Epic data only include vaccinations administered at SFDPH managed sites to SF residents.  \n\nData notes for population characteristic types are listed below. \n\n<u>Age </u>\n* Data only include individuals who are 18 years of age or older. \n \n<u>Race/ethnicity </u>\n* The response option \"Other Race\" is categorized by the data source system, and the response option \"Unknown\" refers to a lack of data. \n \n<u>Sex </u>\n* The response option \"Other\" is categorized by the source system, and the response option \"Unknown\" refers to a lack of data. \n\n<u>Sexual orientation </u>\n* The response option \u201cUnknown/Declined\u201d refers to a lack of data or individuals who reported multiple different sexual orientations during their most recent interaction with SFDPH. \n\nFor convenience, we provide <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/4qbq-hvtt\"> the 2020 5-year American Community Survey population estimates</a>.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS </strong>\nUpdated daily via automated process.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET </strong>\nThis dataset includes many different types of demographic groups. Filter the \u201cdemographic_group\u201d column to explore a topic area. Then, the \u201cdemographic_subgroup\u201d column shows each group or category within that topic area and the total count of doses administered to that population subgroup.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-01-03T19:22:03.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-09-13T23:06:13.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-01-03T19:22:03.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-01-01T15:45:32.000Z", "columns_name": ["data_loaded_at", "demographic_subgroup", "data_source", "data_updated_at", "max_date_administered", "percent_of_recipients", "population_estimate", "data_as_of", "demographic_group", "total_recipients"], "columns_field_name": ["data_loaded_at", "demographic_subgroup", "data_source", "data_updated_at", "max_date_administered", "percent_of_recipients", "population_estimate", "data_as_of", "demographic_group", "total_recipients"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Timestamp when the data was last updated here (in the open data portal)", "Specific demographic group counted in a given record (e.g. 18-24, Asian)", "This field indicates whether data are coming from CAIR2, operated by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), or being collected by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) in Epic.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset represents San Francisco COVID-19 related deaths by day. Deaths are included on the date the individual died.\n\nData is lagged by five days, meaning the most date included is 5 days prior to today. All data update daily as more information becomes available. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCOVID-19 deaths are suspected to be associated with COVID-19. This means COVID-19 is listed as a cause of death or significant condition on the death certificate.  \n\nDeaths may be reported by: \n\n* Healthcare providers \n* The California Department of Public Health Vital Records \n* Case investigation or outbreak investigation  \n* The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner \n\nIt takes time to process this data. Because of this, data is lagged by 5 days and death totals for previous days may increase or decrease. More recent data is less reliable. \n\nData are continually updated to maximize completeness of information and reporting on San Francisco COVID-19 deaths.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 AM Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 AM and 09:00 AM in case of pipeline failure.\n\nDataset will not update on the business day following any federal holiday.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset shows new deaths and cumulative deaths by date of death. New deaths are the count of deaths on that specific date. Cumulative deaths are the running total of all San Francisco COVID-19 deaths up to the date listed.\n\nUse the <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/kkr3-wq7h\">Deaths by Population Characteristics Over Time dataset</a> to see deaths by different subgroups including race/ethnicity, age, gender, and homelessness.\n\n<strong>E.

{"resource": {"name": "On-street Carshare Parking", "id": "g2t6-cyw6", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "A. SUMMARY This dataset was first created as part of the SFMTA On Street Car Share Pilot Program (approved by the MTA Board in July 2013) to illustrate the location of implemented and planned (various stages) spaces throughout the city.\n\nB. METHODOLOGY  The locations were originally provided to the MTA as requests by the three car share organizations (CSOs). These were given as a .kml file, which was converted to a .shp. Additional fields were created using spatial joins (zipcode, supervisor district, CNN, etc). Use definition query tool to display those locations with a certain attribute. For example, query Existing = 1 to display those locations that are on street operating. 500 submissions were given by CSOs to the MTA, but only a portion of those were brought to the MTA Board for approval, and even fewer were implemented as operational on street spaces. With no definition query, you can see all spaces as features, with varying levels of data completion. \n\nC. UPDATE FREQUENCY  During periods of implementation/construction, updates were as frequent as daily or weekly. However, as the frequency of newly implemented spaces slowed over the course of the pilot, updates occurred less frequently--weekly or monthly. Updates will be needed as new spaces are implemented--many of the spaces not taken past MTA Board approval have incomplete data.  \n\nD. OTHER CRITICAL INFO  Each feature (or each row, or point) represents a single car share parking space. Some parking spaces belong to a \"pod\" where there are two adjacent car share parking spaces, indicated by the \"PodType\" field. To summarize or analyze by pod, use the \"POD\" field.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-03-27T17:00:29.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-04-24T21:36:20.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-03-27T17:00:28.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-03-27T17:00:29.000Z", "columns_name": ["OBJECTID", "SPACEID", "INFO", "POD", "SPACE_TYPE", "CSO", "DATESUBMIT", "DATEMODIFY", "EXISTING", "CONFLICT", "FLAG_NOTE", "POINT_X", "POINT_Y", "ST_NAME", "ST_TYPE", "STREETNAME", "ADDRANGE", "POST_ID", "PH_DATE", "TASC_DATE", "MTAB_DATE", "APPROVAL", "WO_LOG_NO", "WO_ROUND", "WO_STATUS", "WO_COMPLET", "OPER_DATE", "ADDRESS", "INTRSXN", "CNN_SEG", "CNN_INTXN", "PODTYPE", "ZIPCODE", "NHOOD", "PRICEZONE", "SUPNAME", "SUPDSTRICT", "STATUS", "CSO_NUM", "GLOBALID", "shape"], "columns_field_name": ["objectid", "spaceid", "info", "pod", "space_type", "cso", "datesubmit", "datemodify", "existing", "conflict", "flag_note", "point_x", "point_y", "st_name", "st_type", "streetname", "addrange", "post_id", "ph_date", "tasc_date", "mtab_date", "approval", "wo_log_no", "wo_round", "wo_status", "wo_complet", "oper_date", "address", "intrsxn", "cnn_seg", "cnn_intxn", "podtype", "zipcode", "nhood", "pricezone", "supname", "supdstrict", "status", "cso_num", "globalid", "shape"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Automatic unique identifier created by system", "Unique identifier for the on-street car sharing space (refers to the CSO and location of the space request, where City CarShare begins with C; Getaround with G; Zipcar with Z.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Vaccinations Given to SF Residents by Demographics", "id": "g8hh-rwgb", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong> \nThis dataset represents the COVID-19 vaccinations given to residents of San Francisco. All vaccines given to SF residents are included, no matter where the vaccination took place (the vaccine may have been administered in San Francisco or outside of San Francisco). The data are broken down by multiple demographic stratifications. This dataset also includes COVID-19 vaccinations given to SF residents by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). \n\nData provides counts for residents who have received at least one dose, residents who have completed a primary vaccine series, residents who have received one or two monovalent (not bivalent) booster doses, and residents who have received a bivalent booster dose. A primary vaccine series is complete after an individual has received all intended doses of the initial series. There are one, two, and three dose primary vaccine series. \n \n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong> \nInformation on doses administered to those who live in San Francisco is from the <a href=\"https://cdph.ca.gov/CAIR\">California Immunization Registry (CAIR2)</a>, run by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The information on individuals\u2019 city of residence, age, race, and ethnicity are also recorded in CAIR and are self-reported at the time of vaccine administration. \n\nIn order to estimate the percent of San Franciscans vaccinated, we provide the 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) population estimates for each demographic group.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> \nUpdated daily via automated process \n \n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong> \nSan Francisco population estimates for race/ethnicity and age groups can be found in a <a href=\" https://data.sfgov.org/d/cedd-86uf\">view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset</a>. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS). \n\nBefore analysis, you must filter the dataset to the desired stratification of data using the \"overall_segment\" column. \n \nFor example, filtering \"overall_segment\" to \"All SF Residents by Age Bracket, Administered by All Providers\" will filter the data to residents whose vaccinations were administered by any provider. You can then further segment the data and calculate percentages by Age Brackets. \n \nIf you filter \"overall_segment\" to \"All SF Residents by Race/Ethnicity, Administered by DPH Only\", you will see the race/ethnicity breakdown for residents who received vaccinations from the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). \n\nIf you filter \"overall_segment\" to \"All SF Residents by Age Group, Administered by All Providers\" you will see vaccination counts of various age eligibility groups that were administered by any provider. \n\nTo count the number of individuals vaccinated (with any primary series dose), use the \"total_recipients\" column. To count the number of individuals who have completed their primary vaccine series, use the \"total_series_completed\" column. To count the number of primary series doses administered (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or single doses), use the \"total_primary_series_doses\" column. \n \nTo count the number of individuals who received one or two monovalent (not bivalent) booster doses, use the \"total_booster_recipients\" and \"total_2nd_booster_recipients\" columns. To count the number of individuals who received their first bivalent booster dose, use the \"total_bivalent_booster_recipients\" column. To count the number of monovalent (not including bivalent) or bivalent booster doses administered, use the \"total_booster_doses\" or \"total_bivalent_booster_doses\" columns.  \n\n<strong>E.

For historical purposes, you can access the archived dataset at the following link:  \n\n<a href= \"https://data.sfgov.org/d/wv2h-rqwk\">ARCHIVED: COVID-19 Vaccine Doses Given to San Franciscans by Demographics</a>\n\n<strong>F.

SUMMARY</strong>\nLaw Enforcement Dispatched Calls for Service \u2013 Real-time dataset includes all calls for service  which generate a record in the Department of Emergency Management's Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System, and typically have a law enforcement unit dispatched to the location. Calls originate from the public via calls to the 911 call center or from law enforcement officers in the field upon viewing an incident (\u2018On-View\u2019).  \n \nThe Real-time dataset is delayed by 10 minutes, and represents a rolling 48 hour window of calls for service.  It contains both open and closed calls and is updated every 10 minutes.  It is delayed by 10 minutes. Open calls are active calls that are unverified, but being worked by law enforcement. Closed calls are calls that law enforcement have indicated are resolved.  Not all Calls for Service generate a Police Incident Report, so data does not directly correlate to the Police Incidents Report dataset. The dataset contains calls handled by law enforcement which can include Police, MTA parking enforcement, the Sheriff\u2019s Office, and others. All relevant time intervals are also included. Some Calls for Service data is suppressed, due to the nature of the call and privacy concerns related to the incident. \n\nPlease refer <u><a href=\"https://datasf.gitbook.io/datasf-dataset-explainers/law-enforcement-dispatched-calls-for-service\">Law Enforcement Dispatched Calls for Service Explainer</a></u> for full documentation \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>  \nOnce a received 911 call is dispatched, a record (CAD#) is generated in the Department of Emergency Management's Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System.   \n\n<strong>C.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset represents San Francisco COVID-19 positive confirmed cases by vaccination status over time, starting January 1, 2021. Cases are included on the date the positive test was collected (the specimen collection date). Cases are counted in three categories: (1) all cases; (2) unvaccinated cases; and (3) completed primary series cases.\n\n1.\tAll cases: Includes cases among all San Francisco residents regardless of vaccination status.\n\n2.\tUnvaccinated cases: Cases are considered unvaccinated if their positive COVID-19 test was before receiving any vaccine. Cases that are not matched to a COVID-19 vaccination record are considered unvaccinated.\n\n3.\tCompleted primary series cases: Cases are considered completed primary series if their positive COVID-19 test was 14 days or more after they received their 2nd dose in a 2-dose COVID-19 series or the single dose of a 1-dose vaccine. These are also called \u201cbreakthrough cases.\u201d \n\nOn September 12, 2021, a new case definition of COVID-19 was introduced that includes criteria for enumerating new infections after previous probable or confirmed infections (also known as reinfections). A reinfection is defined as a confirmed positive PCR lab test more than 90 days after a positive PCR or antigen test. The first reinfection case was identified on December 7, 2021. \n\nData is lagged by eight days, meaning the most recent specimen collection date included is eight days prior to today. All data updates daily as more information becomes available.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCase information is based on confirmed positive laboratory tests reported to the City. The City then completes quality assurance and other data verification processes.   Vaccination data comes from the California Immunization Registry (CAIR2). The California Department of Public Health runs CAIR2. Individual-level case and vaccination data are matched to identify cases by vaccination status in this dataset. Case records are matched to vaccine records using first name, last name, date of birth, phone number, and email address.    \n\nWe include vaccination records from all nine Bay Area counties in order to improve matching rates. This allows us to identify breakthrough cases among people who moved to the City from other Bay Area counties after completing their vaccine series. Only cases among San Francisco residents are included. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 08:00 AM Pacific Time each day. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nTotal San Francisco population estimates can be found in a <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/cedd-86uf\">view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset</a>. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS). To identify total San Francisco population estimates, filter the view on \u201cdemographic_category_label\u201d = \u201call ages\u201d. \n\nPopulation estimates by vaccination status are derived from our publicly reported vaccination counts, which can be found at <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/rutu-rpar\"> COVID-19 Vaccinations Given to SF Residents Over Time</a>. \n\nThe dataset includes new cases, 7-day average new cases, new case rates, 7-day average new case rates, percent of total cases, and 7-day average percent of total cases for each vaccination category. \n\nNew cases are the count of cases where the positive tests were collected on that specific specimen collection date. The 7-day rolling average shows the trend in new cases. The rolling average is calculated by averaging the new cases for a particular day with the prior 6 days.\n\nNew case rates are the count of new cases per 100,000 residents in each vaccination status group. The 7-day rolling average shows the trend in case rates. The rolling average is calculated by averaging the case rate for a particular day with the prior six days.

For more information please see http://sf-planning.org/pipeline-report\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe dataset is created by combining projects data from the City Planning Department and permit data from the Building Inspection Department to create a quarterly snapshot that shows when a project is filed to construction.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe Development Pipeline is updated as a quarterly snapshot of the construction development in the City of San Francisco.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nEach row or record is a project or permit. They are fitted with information such as address, block lot, project case number and spatial data that allow users to find the specific project. Each row also contains project specific information such as project description and details to illustrate the scope of the project.\n\n<strong>E. DATA NOTES </strong>\n\n<strong>Reporting Update</strong>\nSignificant data and systems improvements are underway to produce a more accurate quarterly pipeline, so the data may change at any time. Weekly and monthly data on Planning Applications and Building Permits can be accessed via the City's Open Data Portal.\n\n<strong>Change in Status Definitions</strong>\nThe following changes have been made in status definitions since the 2022 Q1 Pipeline Report to align the Quarterly Pipeline Reports with other Housing Reports (Housing Inventory and Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) Annual Progress)  <br>\n<strong> (1) Construction: </strong> projects that are authorized for construction deemed to be in the construction stage.

{"resource": {"name": "Dwelling Unit Completion Counts by Building Permit", "id": "j67f-aayr", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "A. SUMMARY \n\nThis dataset reports the number of new residential units made available for occupancy in San Francisco since January 2018. Each row in this dataset shows the change in the number of new units associated with a building permit application. Each row also includes the date those units were approved for occupancy, the type of document approving them, and their address.\n\nValues in the column [Number of Units Certified] can be added together to produce a count of new units approved for occupancy since January 2018. \n\nThese records provide a preliminary count of new residential units. The San Francisco Planning Department issues a Housing Inventory Report each year that provides a more complete account of new residential units, and those results may vary slightly from records in this dataset. The Housing Inventory Report is an in-depth annual research project requiring extensive work to validate information about projects. By comparison, this dataset is meant to provide more timely updates about housing production based on available administrative data. The Department of Building Inspection and Planning Department will reconcile these records with future Housing Inventory Reports.\n\nB. METHODOLOGY \n\nAt the end of each month, DBI staff manually calculate how many new units are available for occupancy for each building permit application and enters that information into this dataset. These records reflect counts for all types of residential units, including authorized accessory dwelling units. These records do not reflect units demolished or removed from the city\u2019s available housing stock.\n\nMultiple records may be associated with the same building permit application number, which means that new certifications or amendments were issued. Only changes to the net number of units associated with that permit application are recorded in subsequent records. \n\nFor example, Building Permit Application Number [201601010001] located at [123 1st Avenue] was issued an [Initial TCO] Temporary Certificate of Occupancy on [January 1, 2018] approving 10 units for occupancy. Then, an [Amended TCO] was issued on [June 1, 2018] approving [5] additional units for occupancy, for a total of 15 new units associated with that Building Permit Application Number. The building will appear as twice in the dataset, each row representing when new units were approved.\n\nIf additional or amended certifications are issued for a building permit application, but they do not change the number of units associated with that building permit application, those certifications are not recorded in this dataset. For example, if all new units associated with a project are certified for occupancy under an Initial TCO, then the Certificate of Final Completion (CFC) would not appear in the dataset because the CFC would not add new units to the housing stock.\nSee data definitions for more details.\n\nC. UPDATE FREQUENCY \n\nThis dataset is updated monthly.\n\nD. DOCUMENT TYPES\n\nSeveral documents issued near or at project completion can certify units for occupation. They are: Initial Temporary Certificate of Occupancy (TCO), Amended TCO, and Certificate of Final Completion (CFC). \n\n\u2022\tInitial TCO is a document that allows for occupancy of a unit before final project completion is certified, conditional on if the unit can be occupied safely. The TCO is meant to be temporary and has an expiration date. This field represents the number of units certified for occupancy when the TCO is issued. \n\u2022\tAmended TCO is a document that is issued when the conditions of the project are changed before final project completion is certified. These records show additional new units that have become habitable since the issuance of the Initial TCO. \n\u2022\tCertificate of Final Completion (CFC) is a document that is issued when all work is completed according to approved plans, and the building is ready for complete occupancy.

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset shows San Francisco COVID-19 cases by population characteristics and by specimen collection date. Cases are included on the date the positive test was collected.\n\nOn September 12, 2021, a new case definition of COVID-19 was introduced that includes criteria for enumerating new infections after previous probable or confirmed infections (also known as reinfections). A reinfection is defined as a confirmed positive PCR lab test more than 90 days after a positive PCR or antigen test. The first reinfection case was identified on December 7, 2021.\n\nPopulation characteristics are subgroups, or demographic cross-sections, like age, race, or gender. The City tracks how cases have been distributed among different subgroups. This information can reveal trends and disparities among groups.\n\nData is lagged by five days, meaning the most recent specimen collection date included is 5 days prior to today. Tests take time to process and report, so more recent data is less reliable.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nData on the population characteristics of COVID-19 cases and deaths are from: \n* Case interviews \n* Laboratories \n* Medical providers \n\nThese multiple streams of data are merged, deduplicated, and undergo data verification processes. This data may not be immediately available for recently reported cases because of the time needed to process tests and validate cases. Daily case totals on previous days may increase or decrease. <u><a href=\"https://sf.gov/information/covid-19-data-questions\">Learn more</a></u>. \n\nData are continually updated to maximize completeness of information and reporting on San Francisco residents with COVID-19.\n\nData notes on each population characteristic type is listed below.\n\n<u> Race/ethnicity</u>\n* We include all race/ethnicity categories that are collected for COVID-19 cases.\n* The population estimates for the \"Other\" or \u201cMulti-racial\u201d groups should be considered with caution. The Census definition is likely not exactly aligned with how the City collects this data. For that reason, we do not recommend calculating population rates for these groups.\n\n<u> Sexual orientation</u>\n* The City began asking adults 18 years old or older for their sexual orientation identification during case interviews as of April 28, 2020. Sexual orientation data prior to this date is unavailable.\n* The City doesn\u2019t collect or report information about sexual orientation for persons under 12 years of age.\n* Case investigation interviews transitioned to the California Department of Public Health, Virtual Assistant information gathering beginning December 2021. The Virtual Assistant is only sent to adults who are 18+ years old.<u><a href=\"https://www.sfdph.org/dph/files/PoliciesProcedures/COM9_SexualOrientationGuidelines.pdf\"> Learn more about our data collection guidelines pertaining to sexual orientation</a></u>. \n\n<u> Gender</u>\n* The City collects information on gender identity using <a href=\"https://www.sfdph.org/dph/files/PoliciesProcedures/COM5_SexGenderGuidelines.pdf\">these guidelines</a>. \n\n<u> Comorbidities</u>\n* Underlying conditions are reported when a person has one or more underlying health conditions at the time of diagnosis or death.\n\n<u> Transmission type</u> \n* Information on transmission of COVID-19 is based on case interviews with individuals who have a confirmed positive test. Individuals are asked if they have been in close contact with a known COVID-19 case. If they answer yes, transmission category is recorded as contact with a known case. If they report no contact with a known case, transmission category is recorded as community transmission. If the case is not interviewed or was not asked the question, they are counted as unknown.\n\n<u>Homelessness</u> \nPersons are identified as homeless based on several data sources: \n     * self-reported living situation  \n     * the location at the time of testing \n     * Department of Public Health homelessness and he", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-03-27T14:03:12.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-06-08T18:23:23.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-03-27T14:03:05.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-03-27T14:03:12.000Z", "columns_name": ["specimen_collection_date", "population_estimate", "new_cases", "data_loaded_at", "data_as_of", "cumulative_cases", "characteristic_type", "characteristic_group_sort_order", "characteristic_group"], "columns_field_name": ["specimen_collection_date", "population_estimate", "new_cases", "data_loaded_at", "data_as_of", "cumulative_cases", "characteristic_type", "characteristic_group_sort_order", "characteristic_group"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["The date the positive test was collected (the date the person was tested)", "2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) population estimate for a given characteristic type and characteristic group", "Cases are counted as confirmed on the date of specimen collection after a positive lab test result", "Timestamp when data entered the Socrata system", "Timestamp for last update date in source system", "Cumulative cases as of the specified date", "Overall topic area for a given population characteristic.

Areas within this boundary are highly likely to experience \u201cdeep and contiguous\u201d flooding during a 100-year storm. A 100-year storm is a storm that has a 1% chance of occurring in a given year. \u201cDeep and contiguous flooding\u201d means flooding at least 6-inches deep spanning an area at least the size of an average City block. The 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Zone does not provide the exact depth of flooding at a given location. It also does not show areas in the City that may experience shallower and/or more localized flooding in a 100-year storm. Finally, the 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Zone shows flood risk from storm runoff only. It does not consider flood risk in San Francisco from other causes such as shoreline overtopping and overland inundation from the San Francisco Bay or Pacific Ocean.\n\nIn addition to the 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Zone, the 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Map shows: \n\n\u2022\t\u201cAreas not served by the Combined Sewer and Stormwater Collection System\u201d - showing where data for rainfall driven storm runoff is not available, and where flood risk has not been analyzed.\n\u2022\t\u201cHistorical Shoreline\u201d, \u201cHistorical Creeks\u201d, and \u201cHistorical Waterbodies\u201d - historical hydrology layers to illustrate the general topography of low-lying areas in the City.\nThe Horizontal Datum used for the GIS layers is \u201cNAD_1983_2011_StatePlane_California_III_FIPS_0403_Ft_US.\u201d\n\nNotes on Usage\n\nAt a minimum, the 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Map is updated by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) on an annual basis on or before July 1 to account for any parcel review requests that remove properties from the Flood Zone.

Details for public facilities are compiled from city records, and energy usage is compiled from utility records; related metrics such as energy use intensity are calculated from the combination of such records. Data is subjected to quality assurance validation prior to publication.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Testing by Race/Ethnicity Over Time", "id": "kja3-qsky", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset includes San Francisco COVID-19 tests by race/ethnicity and by date. This dataset represents the daily count of tests collected, and the breakdown of test results (positive, negative, or indeterminate). Tests in this dataset include all those collected from persons who listed San Francisco as their home address at the time of testing. It also includes tests that were collected by San Francisco providers for persons who were missing a locating address. This dataset does not include tests for residents listing a locating address outside of San Francisco, even if they were tested in San Francisco. \n\nThe data were de-duplicated by individual and date, so if a person gets tested multiple times on different dates, all tests will be included in this dataset (on the day each test was collected). If a person tested multiple times on the same date, only one test is included from that date. When there are multiple tests on the same date, a positive result, if one exists, will always be selected as the record for the person. If a PCR and antigen test are taken on the same day, the PCR test will supersede. If a person tests multiple times on the same day and the results are all the same (e.g. all negative or all positive) then the first test done is selected as the record for the person.\n\n<strong>The total number of positive test results is not equal to the total number of COVID-19 cases in San Francisco.</strong> Each positive test result is investigated by the health department. While the city tries to only report on tests for San Francisco residents (or tests in San Francisco for those with no locating address listed), some test results purported to be for San Francisco residents are actually for people living outside the city. This can be discovered during a case investigation or data quality assurance. In such an instance, the test would be counted as a positive test in the SF data but would not be counted as a COVID-19 case in San Francisco. If a person tests positive for COVID-19 on different dates, they would be included each of those times in the testing data but only one case. To track the number of cases by race/ethnicity, see this dashboard:\nhttps://sf.gov/data/covid-19-population-characteristics#race-or-ethnicity-\n\nWhen a person gets tested for COVID-19, they may be asked to report information about themselves. One piece of information that might be requested is a person's race and ethnicity. These data are often incomplete in the laboratory and provider reports of the test results sent to the health department. The data can be missing or incomplete for several possible reasons:\n\n\t\u2022 The person was not asked about their race and ethnicity.\n\t\u2022 The person was asked, but refused to answer.\n\t\u2022 The person answered, but the testing provider did not include the person's answers in the reports.\n\t\u2022 The testing provider reported the person's answers in a format that could not be used by the health department.\n\nFor any of these reasons, a person's race/ethnicity will be recorded in the dataset as \u201cUnknown.\u201d\n\n<strong>B. NOTE ON RACE/ETHNICITY</strong>\nThe different values for Race/Ethnicity in this dataset are \"Asian;\" \"Black or African American;\" \"Hispanic or Latino/a, all races;\" \"American Indian or Alaska Native;\" \"Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander;\" \"White;\" \"Multi-racial;\" \"Other;\" and \u201cUnknown.\"\n\nOn February 10, 2022, the method for which race/ethnicity is categorized was updated for the sake of data accuracy, clarity, and stability. The new categorization increases data clarity by emulating the methodology used by the U.S. Census in the American Community Survey.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Deaths by Population Characteristics Over Time", "id": "kkr3-wq7h", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>Note: On 1/31/2023 we added the column \"population_estimate\" to reflect the 2020 Census Bureau American Community Survey (ACS) San Francisco Population estimates.</strong>\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset shows San Francisco COVID-19 deaths by population characteristics and by date. Deaths are included on the date the individual died.\n\nPopulation characteristics are subgroups, or demographic cross-sections, like age, race, or gender. The City tracks how deaths have been distributed among different subgroups. This information can reveal trends and disparities among groups.\n\nData is lagged by five days, meaning the most date included is 5 days prior to today. All data update daily as more information becomes available. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCOVID-19 deaths are suspected to be associated with COVID-19. This means COVID-19 is listed as a cause of death or significant condition on the death certificate.  \n\nData on the population characteristics of COVID-19 deaths are from: \n* Case interviews \n* Laboratories \n* Medical providers \n\nThese multiple streams of data are merged, deduplicated, and undergo data verification processes. It takes time to process this data. Because of this, data is lagged by 5 days and death totals for previous days may increase or decrease. More recent data is less reliable. \n\nData are continually updated to maximize completeness of information and reporting on San Francisco COVID-19 deaths.\n\nData notes on each population characteristic type is listed below.\n\n<u> Race/ethnicity</u> \n* We include all race/ethnicity categories that are collected for COVID-19 cases.\n\n<u> Sexual orientation</u> \n* The City began asking adults 18 years old or older for their sexual orientation identification during case interviews as of April 28, 2020. Sexual orientation data prior to this date is unavailable.\n* The City doesn\u2019t collect or report information about sexual orientation for persons under 12 years of age.\n* Case investigation interviews transitioned to Virtual Assistant information gathering starting December 2021. The California Department of Public Health, Virtual Assistant is only sent to adults who are 18+ years old.<u><a href=\"https://www.sfdph.org/dph/files/PoliciesProcedures/COM9_SexualOrientationGuidelines.pdf\"> Learn more about our data collection guidelines pertaining to sexual orientation</a></u>. \n\nGender\n* The City collects information on gender identity using <u><a href=\"https://www.sfdph.org/dph/files/PoliciesProcedures/COM5_SexGenderGuidelines.pdf\">these guidelines</a></u>. \n\n<u> Comorbidities</u> \n* Underlying conditions are reported when a person has one or more underlying health conditions at the time of diagnosis or death.\n\n<u> Transmission type</u> \n* Information on transmission of COVID-19 is based on case interviews with individuals who have a confirmed positive test. Individuals are asked if they have been in close contact with a known COVID-19 case. If they answer yes, transmission category is recorded as contact with a known case. If they report no contact with a known case, transmission category is recorded as community transmission. If the case is not interviewed or was not asked the question, they are counted as unknown.\n\n<u> Homelessness</u> \n Persons are identified as homeless based on several data sources: \n     * self-reported living situation  \n     * the location at the time of testing \n     * Department of Public Health homelessness and health databases \n     * Residents in Single-Room Occupancy hotels are not included in these figures.  \nThese methods serve as an estimate of persons experiencing homelessness. They may not meet other homelessness definitions. \n\n<u> Single Room Occupancy (SRO) tenancy</u> \n* SRO buildings are defined by the San Francisco Housing Code as having six or more \"residential guest rooms\" which may be attached to shared bathrooms, kitchens, and living spaces.\n* The details of a person's living arrangements are verifi", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-03-27T14:02:35.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-06-08T18:42:47.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-03-27T14:02:28.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-03-27T14:02:35.000Z", "columns_name": ["characteristic_group_sort_order", "new_deaths", "characteristic_type", "characteristic_group", "data_loaded_at", "cumulative_deaths", "date_of_death", "data_as_of", "population_estimate"], "columns_field_name": ["characteristic_group_sort_order", "new_deaths", "characteristic_type", "characteristic_group", "data_loaded_at", "cumulative_deaths", "date_of_death", "data_as_of", "population_estimate"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Sort order of characteristic group to aid in visualizing data", "Count of deaths on specified date", "Overall topic area for a given population characteristic.

An \u201cinterested party\u201d is a person who is a party, participant or agent of a party or participant to certain types of proceedings before the official in question. Those proceedings are limited to administrative enforcement proceedings and proceedings regarding permits, licenses, or other entitlements for use.

An agent is someone who represents a party or a participant in such a proceeding.\n\nThe filing deadline for Form SFEC-3610(b) depends on the circumstances under which the behested payment was made.\n\nIf the behested payment was made while the proceeding involving the interested party is pending before the official, then the form must be filed within thirty days of the payment being made.

If there is a series of behested payments, the form is due within 30 days of the payment that makes the total $1,000 or more.\n\nFinally, if the behested payment was made in the 12 months prior to the commencement of the proceeding involving the interested party, the form is due within 30 days of the date the official knew or should have known that the source of the behested payment became an interested party.\n\nEach row in this dataset represents information about payors reported in the \"Payors Information\" sub-table of a Form SFEC-3610(b) filed with the Ethics Commission.

Therefore, it is helpful to use both the Supplier Contracts and Supplier Payments reports on SFOpenBook, as well as on DataSF.\n\nSupplier payments represent payments to City contractors and vendors that provide goods and/or services to the City.

SUMMARY</strong>\nCase information on COVID-19 Laboratory testing. This data includes a daily count of test results reported, and how many of those were positive, negative, and indeterminate. Reported tests include tests with a positive, negative or indeterminate result. Indeterminate results, which could not conclusively determine whether COVID-19 virus was present, are not included in the calculation of percent positive. Testing for the novel coronavirus is available through commercial, clinical, and hospital laboratories, as well as the SFDPH Public Health Laboratory.\n\nTests are de-duplicated by an individual and date. This means that if a person gets tested multiple times on different dates in the last 30 days, all of those individual tests will be included in this data as individual tests (on each specimen collection date).\n\n<strong>Total positive test results is not equal to the total number of COVID-19 cases in San Francisco.</strong> Each positive test result is investigated. During this investigation, some test results are found to be for persons living outside of San Francisco and some are duplicates of previously received positive results. These are not included in the total San Francisco COVID-19 case count. Additionally, investigation of positive test results might not be completed on the day of receipt; new cases will be added to the total case count after full investigation and verification. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nLaboratory test volume and positivity for COVID-19 is based on electronic laboratory test reports. Deduplication, quality assurance measures and other data verification processes maximize accuracy of laboratory test information.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nDue to the high degree of variation in the time needed to complete tests by different labs there is a delay in this reporting. On March 24 the Health Officer ordered all labs in the City to report complete COVID-19 testing information to the local and state health departments. In order to track trends over time, a data user can analyze this data by \"result_date\" and see how the count of reported results and positivity rate have changed over time.\n\n<strong>E.

{"resource": {"name": "Traffic Crashes Resulting in Injury: Victims Involved", "id": "nwes-mmgh", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis table contains all victims (parties who are injured) involved in a traffic crash resulting in an injury in the City of San Francisco. Fatality year-to-date crash data is obtained from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OME) death records, and only includes those cases that meet the San Francisco Vision Zero Fatality Protocol maintained by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH), San Francisco Police Department (SFPD), and San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). Injury crash data is obtained from SFPD\u2019s Interim Collision System for 2018 to YTD, Crossroads Software Traffic Collision Database (CR) for years 2013-2017 and the Statewide Integrated Transportation Record System (SWITRS) maintained by the California Highway Patrol for all years prior to 2013. Only crashes with valid geographic information are mapped. All geocodable crash data is represented on the simplified San Francisco street centerline model maintained by the Department of Public Works (SFDPW). Collision injury data is queried and aggregated on a quarterly basis. Crashes occurring at complex intersections with multiple roadways are mapped onto a single point and injury and fatality crashes occurring on highways are excluded.\n\nThe crash, party, and victim tables have a relational structure. The traffic crashes table contains information on each crash, one record per crash. The party table contains information from all parties involved in the crashes, one record per party. Parties are individuals involved in a traffic crash including drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and parked vehicles. The victim table contains information about each party injured in the collision, including any passengers. Injury severity is included in the victim table. \n\nFor example, a crash occurs (1 record in the crash table) that involves a driver party and a pedestrian party (2 records in the party table). Only the pedestrian is injured and thus is the only victim (1 record in the victim table).\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nTraffic crash injury data is collected from the California Highway Patrol 555 Crash Report as submitted by the police officer within 30 days after the crash occurred. All fields that match the SWITRS data schema are programmatically extracted, de-identified, geocoded, and loaded into TransBASE. See Section D below for details regarding TransBASE. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nAfter review by SFPD and SFDPH staff, the data is made publicly available approximately a month after the end of the previous quarter (May for Q1, August for Q2, November for Q3, and February for Q4). \n\n<strong>D.

This dataset combines all schedules, pages, and includes unitemized totals. Only transactions from the \"most recent\" version of a filing (original/amendment) appear here.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCommittees file campaign statements with the Ethics Commission on a periodic basis. Those statements are stored with the Commission's data provider. Data is generally presented as-filed by committees.\n\nIf a committee files an amendment, the data from that filing completely replaces the original and any prior amendments in the filing sequence.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nEach night starting at midnight Pacific time a script runs to check for new filings with the Commission's database, and updates this dataset with transactions from new filings. The update process can take a variable amount of time to complete. Viewing or downloading this dataset while the update is running may result in incomplete data, therefore it is highly recommended to view or download this data before midnight or after 8am.\n\nDuring the update, some fields are copied from the Filings dataset into this dataset for viewing convenience. The copy process may occasionally fail for some transactions due to timing issues but should self-correct the following day. Transactions with a blank 'Filing Id Number' or 'Filing Date' field are such transactions, but can be joined with the appropriate record using the 'Filing Activity Nid' field shared between Filing and Transaction datasets.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>  \nTransactions from rejected filings are not included in this dataset. Transactions from many different FPPC forms and schedules are combined in this dataset, refer to the column \"Form Type\" to differentiate transaction types.\nProperties suffixed with \"-nid\" can be used to join the data between Filers, Filings, and Transaction datasets.\nRefer to the <a href=\"https://sfethics.org/disclosures/campaign-finance-disclosure/campaign-finance-disclosure-data\">Ethics

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Testing by Geography Over Time", "id": "qhc5-mubk", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset includes COVID-19 tests by resident neighborhood and specimen collection date (the day the test was collected). Specifically, this dataset includes tests of San Francisco residents who listed a San Francisco home address at the time of testing. These resident addresses were then geo-located and mapped to neighborhoods. The resident address associated with each test is hand-entered and susceptible to errors, therefore neighborhood data should be interpreted as an approximation, not a precise nor comprehensive total.\n\nIn recent months, about 5% of tests are missing addresses and therefore cannot be included in any neighborhood totals. In earlier months, more tests were missing address data. Because of this high percentage of tests missing resident address data, this neighborhood testing data for March, April, and May should be interpreted with caution (see below)\n\nPercentage of tests missing address information, by month in 2020\nMar - 33.6%\nApr - 25.9%\nMay - 11.1%\nJun - 7.2%\nJul - 5.8%\nAug - 5.4%\nSep - 5.1%\nOct (Oct 1-12) - 5.1%\n\nTo protect the privacy of residents, the City does not disclose the number of tests in neighborhoods with resident populations of fewer than 1,000 people. These neighborhoods are omitted from the data (they include Golden Gate Park, John McLaren Park, and Lands End).\n\nTests for residents that listed a Skilled Nursing Facility as their home address are not included in this neighborhood-level testing data. Skilled Nursing Facilities have required and repeated testing of residents, which would change neighborhood trends and not reflect the broader neighborhood's testing data.\n\nThis data was de-duplicated by individual and date, so if a person gets tested multiple times on different dates, all tests will be included in this dataset (on the day each test was collected). \n\n<strong>The total number of positive test results is not equal to the total number of COVID-19 cases in San Francisco. </strong>During this investigation, some test results are found to be for persons living outside of San Francisco and some people in San Francisco may be tested multiple times (which is common). To see the number of new confirmed cases by neighborhood, reference this map: https://sf.gov/data/covid-19-case-maps#new-cases-maps\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCOVID-19 laboratory test data is based on electronic laboratory test reports. Deduplication, quality assurance measures and other data verification processes maximize accuracy of laboratory test information. All testing data is then geo-coded by resident address. Then data is aggregated by analysis neighborhood and specimen collection date.\n\nData are prepared by close of business Monday through Saturday for public display.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nSan Francisco population estimates for geographic regions can be found in a <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/35v5-seg9\">view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset</a>.

{"resource": {"name": "Campaign Finance - Filings Received by SFEC", "id": "qizs-bwft", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset lists the current campaign filings received by the SFEC; Campaign forms include FPPC forms 410, 450, 460, 461, 465, 470, 496, 497. Refer to the <a href=\"https://fppc.ca.gov/forms.html\">FPPC page for forms represented in this dataset</a>.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCommittees file campaign statements with the Ethics Commission on a periodic basis. Those statements are stored with the Commission's provider. Data is generally presented as-filed by committees.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nEach night starting at midnight Pacific time a script runs to check for new filings with the Commission's database, and updates this dataset with transactions from new filings. The update process can take a variable amount of time to complete. Viewing or downloading this dataset while the update is running may result in incomplete data, therefore it is highly recommended to view or download this data before midnight or after 8am.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nFilings received on paper will not have corresponding data in the Transactions or Summary datasets.\nA \"rejected\" filing is usually one made in error, under the wrong filing account, or containing an error in reporting period.\nAmendment filings supersede all transactions from the original filing and any prior amendments. Transactions from prior filings are removed from the accompanying \"Transactions\" dataset in order to represent the most up-to-date version of transactions.\n\"Filer Name\" reflects the name of the committee at time of filing. Committees can change names over time.\n\nRefer to the <a href=\"https://sfethics.org/disclosures/campaign-finance-disclosure/campaign-finance-disclosure-data\">Ethics Commission's webpage</a> for more information.\n\n<strong>RELATED DATASETS</strong>\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Campaign-Finance-San-Francisco-Campaign-Filers/4c8t-ngau\">San Francisco Campaign Filers</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Campaign-Finance-Filings-Received-by-SFEC/qizs-bwft\">Filings Received by SFEC</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Campaign-Finance-Summary-Totals/9ggq-m8hp\">Summary Totals</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Campaign-Finance-Transactions/pitq-e56w\">Transactions</a></li>\n</ul>", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-03-27T08:12:05.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-03-01T23:14:09.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-10-03T20:23:53.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-03-27T08:12:05.000Z", "columns_name": ["Current Status", "Filing Nid", "Filer Nid", "Filing Start Date", "Filing Date", "Filer FPPC Id", "Data Loaded At", "Data As Of", "Redacted Rendering Nid", "Filer Name", "Attachments Nids", "Form Type", "Filing DateTime", "Filing Activity Nid", "Publish Sequence", "Sync Status", "Report Number", "Filing End Date", "Rejected", "Filing Mechanism", "Has Efile Content", "Filing Version", "Filing Id Number", "Filing Type", "Sync Flag", "Rendering URL"], "columns_field_name": ["current_status", "filing_nid", "filer_nid", "start_date", "filing_date", "fppc_id", "data_loaded_at", "data_as_of", "redacted_rendering_nid", "filer_name", "attachments_nids", "form_type", "filing_datetime", "filing_activity_nid", "publish_sequence", "sync_status", "report_number", "end_date", "rejected", "mechanism_type", "has_efile_content", "filing_version", "filing_id_number", "filing_type", "sync_flag", "rendering_url"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Text", "Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Calendar date", "Checkbox", "Text", "Checkbox", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Checkbox", "URL"], "columns_description": ["If this filing is superceded, the filingid that supercedes it; if current, the date of the sync update to this dataset; if this field is blank, there was an error during the sync update", "Unique identifier for the filing", "Unique identifier for the committee", "Starting date of the filing period for the filing (if applicable)", "Date the filing was submitted", "Committee FPPC Id (aka Filer Id, SOS Id) at time of filing.

Trips by visitors to the Bay Area and for commercial purposes are not included.\n\u2022 Provide additional trip details, including trip purpose for each trip in the mode share question series.\n\u2022 Collect demographic data on the population of Bay Area residents who travel to, from, and within San Francisco.\n\u2022 Collect data on travel behavior and opinions that support other SFMTA strategy and project evaluation needs.\n\nThe survey was conducted as a telephone study among 801 Bay Area residents aged 18 and older. Interviewing was conducted in English, Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Tagalog. Surveying was conducted via random digit dial (RDD) and cell phone sample.\nAll survey datasets incorporate respondent weighting based on age and home location; utilize the \u201cweight\u201d field when appropriate in your analysis.\n\nThe survey period for this survey is as follows:\n2019: May - August 2019\n\nThe margin of error is related to sample size (n). For the total sample, the margin of error is 3.3% for a confidence level of 95%. When looking at subsets of the data, such as just the SF population, just the female population, or just the population of people who bicycle, the sample size decreases and the margin of error increases. Below is a guide of the margin of error for different samples sizes. Be cautious in making conclusions based off of small sample sizes.\n\nAt the 95% confidence level is:\n\u2022 n = 801(Total Sample). Margin of error = +/- 3.3%\n\u2022 n = 400.

UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nDataset is updated as needed manually by staff.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nArtworks may be located at a specific addresses (traditional building number, street name format) or other locations (City Parks, Piers, SFO, etc.) that don't meet the traditional address format; in these cases, the closest intersection or building address has been used. Please look at the \"Location Description\" field for the location of the artwork (floor 2, International terminal, Northwest corner, etc.).

A single artwork may have multiple entries, one for each part, or may have a single group entry. Therefore, the number of entries is not equivalent to the number of artworks. Generally, if an artworks' pieces are spread out over a distance, each piece will have an entry and if they are grouped at one location, there will be one group entry. When an artwork spans multiple blocks one end point was chosen for the address/map point. The data column \"number_of_districts\" refers to how many Cultural Districts a mural is in.

SUMMARY</strong>\nData on daily hospital bed use and available capacity at San Francisco acute care hospitals from April 2020 onward. Long Term Care facilities (like Laguna Honda and Kentfield) are not included in this data as acute care patients cannot be admitted to these facilities.\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis hospital capacity information is based on data that all SF acute care hospitals report to the San Francisco Department of Public Health.\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. This data is on a 4-day lag to account for the time needed to complete and validate data from all SF acute care hospitals. \n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis data provides visibility into current occupancy levels and use of San Francisco acute care hospitals and potential ability to accommodate anticipated surges of COVID patients. \nData includes current census of COVID-19 patients (including both confirmed cases and suspected COVID patients) and other patients in acute care hospitals, shown in the \u201cStatus\u201d column. The \u201cStatus\u201d column also includes all available beds.\nThis daily census information is stratified by type of bed (acute care, intensive care, and surge) in the \u201cBed Type\u201d column. Acute care beds treat patients with illnesses and injuries including recovery from surgeries. Intensive care (ICU) beds are for sicker patients in need of critical and life support services that can include the use of a ventilator. Surge beds are the additional beds that can be made available to handle an influx of COVID-19 patients; surge beds are differentiated between acute care surge beds and ICU surge beds.\nNote: The current census of COVID patients shown here may not always match the hospitalizations data (https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-19-Hospitalizations/nxjg-bhem), as that data includes all hospitals and long term care facilities.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Vaccinations Given to SF Residents Over Time", "id": "rutu-rpar", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong> \nThis dataset represents the COVID-19 vaccinations given to residents of San Francisco over time. All vaccines given to SF residents are included, no matter where the vaccination took place (the vaccine may have been administered in San Francisco or outside of San Francisco). This dataset also includes COVID-19 vaccinations given to SF residents by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) over time. \n\nData provides counts for residents who have received at least one dose, residents who have completed a primary vaccine series, residents who have received one or two monovalent (not bivalent) booster doses, and residents who have received a bivalent booster dose. A primary vaccine series is complete after an individual has received all intended doses of the initial series. There are one, two, and three dose primary vaccine series. \n \n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong> \nInformation on doses administered to those who live in San Francisco is from the <a href=\"https://cdph.ca.gov/CAIR\">California Immunization Registry (CAIR2)</a>, run by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). \n \n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> \nUpdated daily via automated process \n \n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong> \nBefore analysis, you must filter the dataset to the desired stratification of data using the \"administering_provider_type\" column. To get vaccination counts of all SF residents regardless of provider, filter to \"administering_provider_type\" = \u2018All Providers\u2019. To get vaccination counts administered by SFDPH to SF residents, filter to \"administering_provider_type\" = \u2018DPH Only\u2019. \n\nTo count the number of individuals vaccinated (with any primary series dose) for the first time on a given day, use the \"new_recipients\" column. To count the number of individuals who have completed their primary vaccine series on a given day, use the \"new_series_completed\" column. To count the number of primary series doses administered on a day (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or single doses), use the \"new_primary_series_doses\" column. \n \nTo count the number of individuals who received their first or second monovalent (not bivalent) booster dose on a given day, use the \"new_booster_recipients\" and \"new_2nd_booster_recipients\" columns. To count the number of individuals who received their first bivalent booster dose on a given day, use the \"new_bivalent_booster_recipients\" column. To count the number of monovalent (not including bivalent) or bivalent booster doses administered on a given day, use the \"new_booster_doses\" or \"new_bivalent_booster_doses\" columns.  \n\nTo count the number of individuals who have received a vaccine up to a certain date, use the columns beginning with \"cumulative_...\" \n\n<strong>E. ARCHIVED DATA</strong> \nThis dataset is a combination of two previous datasets that were archived on 10/27/2022. For historical purposes, you can access the archived datasets at the following links:  \n\n<a href= \"https://data.sfgov.org/d/bqge-2y7k\">ARCHIVED: COVID Vaccinations Given to SF Residents Over Time</a> \n<a href= \"https://data.sfgov.org/d/9tca-udid\">ARCHIVED: COVID Vaccinations Given to SF Residents by SF DPH Over Time</a>\n\n<strong>F. CHANGE LOG</strong> \n<UL><LI>10/27/2022 - the datasets COVID Vaccinations Given to SF Residents Over Time and COVID Vaccinations Given to SF Residents by SF DPH Over Time were merged into a single dataset. The column \u201cadministering_provider_type\u201d can be used to filter between the two metrics. These previous datasets can be found in the ARCHIVED DATA section. \n<LI>10/27/2022 - the columns \u201cnew_1st_doses\u201d, \u201cnew_2nd_doses\u201d, and \u201cnew_single_doses\u201d were removed and consolidated into the column \u201cnew_primary_series_doses\u201d (which also includes 3rd doses for the Pfizer Under 5 series). Similarly, the columns \u201ccumulative_1st_doses\u201d, \u201ccumulative_2nd_doses\u201d, \u201ccumulative_single_doses\u201d, were replaced by \u201ccumulative_primary_series_doses\u201d.</UL>", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-03-27T15:16:30.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-10-05T21:59:47.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-03-27T15:16:26.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-03-27T15:16:30.000Z", "columns_name": ["data_loaded_at", "data_as_of", "cumulative_recipients", "administering_provider_type", "data_updated_at", "cumulative_bivalent_booster_doses", "new_2nd_booster_recipients", "cumulative_2nd_booster_recipients", "new_series_completed", "cumulative_primary_series_doses", "cumulative_series_completed", "date_administered", "new_booster_doses", "new_bivalent_booster_recipients", "cumulative_booster_doses", "cumulative_booster_recipients", "new_bivalent_booster_doses", "new_primary_series_doses", "new_booster_recipients", "cumulative_bivalent_booster_recipients", "new_recipients"], "columns_field_name": ["data_loaded_at", "data_as_of", "cumulative_recipients", "administering_provider_type", "data_updated_at", "cumulative_bivalent_booster_doses", "new_2nd_booster_recipients", "cumulative_2nd_booster_recipients", "new_series_completed", "cumulative_primary_series_doses", "cumulative_series_completed", "date_administered", "new_booster_doses", "new_bivalent_booster_recipients", "cumulative_booster_doses", "cumulative_booster_recipients", "new_bivalent_booster_doses", "new_primary_series_doses", "new_booster_recipients", "cumulative_bivalent_booster_recipients", "new_recipients"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Number", "Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Timestamp when the data was last updated here (in the open data portal)", "Timestamp when the data was last updated in the source system", "Cumulative total individuals vaccinated (with any dose) according to CA's records", "Scope of providers who administered each vaccine dose.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Vaccinations Given to SF Residents by Demographics Over Time", "id": "sej3-bbrc", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong> \nThis dataset represents the COVID-19 vaccinations given to residents of San Francisco over time. All vaccines given to SF residents are included, no matter where the vaccination took place (the vaccine may have been administered in San Francisco or outside of San Francisco). The data are broken down by multiple demographic stratifications. This dataset also includes COVID-19 vaccinations given to SF residents by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) over time. \n\nData provides counts for residents who have received at least one dose, residents who have completed a primary vaccine series, residents who have received one or two monovalent (not bivalent) booster doses, and residents who have received a bivalent booster dose. A primary vaccine series is complete after an individual has received all intended doses of the initial series. There are one, two, and three dose primary vaccine series. \n \n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong> \nInformation on doses administered to those who live in San Francisco is from the <a href=\"https://cdph.ca.gov/CAIR \">California Immunization Registry (CAIR2)</a>, run by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The information on individuals\u2019 city of residence, age, race, and ethnicity are also recorded in CAIR and are self-reported at the time of vaccine administration. \n\nIn order to estimate the percent of San Franciscans vaccinated, we provide the 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) population estimates for each demographic group.\n \n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> \nUpdated daily via automated process \n \n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong> \nSan Francisco population estimates for race/ethnicity and age groups can be found in a <a href=\" https://data.sfgov.org/d/cedd-86uf\">view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset</a>. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS). \n\nBefore analysis, you must filter the dataset to the desired stratification of data using the \"overall_segment\" column. \n \nFor example, filtering \"overall_segment\" to \"All SF Residents by Age Bracket, Administered by All Providers\" will filter the data to residents whose vaccinations were administered by any provider. You can then further segment the data and calculate percentages by Age Brackets. \n \nIf you filter \"overall_segment\" to \"All SF Residents by Race/Ethnicity, Administered by DPH Only\", you will see the race/ethnicity breakdown for residents who received vaccinations from the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). \n\nIf you filter \"overall_segment\" to \"All SF Residents by Age Group, Administered by All Providers\" you will see vaccination counts of various age eligibility groups that were administered by any provider. \n\nTo count the number of individuals vaccinated (with any primary series dose) for the first time on a given day, use the \"new_recipients\" column. To count the number of individuals who have completed their primary vaccine series on a given day, use the \"new_series_completed\" column. To count the number of primary series doses administered on a day (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or single doses), use the \"new_primary_series_doses\" column. \n \nTo count the number of individuals who received their first or second monovalent (not bivalent) booster dose on a given day, use the \"new_booster_recipients\" and \"new_2nd_booster_recipients\" columns. To count the number of individuals who received their first bivalent booster dose on a given day, use the \"new_bivalent_booster_recipients\" column. To count the number of monovalent (not including bivalent) or bivalent booster doses administered on a given day, use the \"new_booster_doses\" or \"new_bivalent_booster_doses\" columns.  \n\nTo count the number of individuals who have received a vaccine up to a certain date, use the columns beginning with \"cumulative_...\" \n\n<strong>E.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Cases and Deaths Summarized by Geography", "id": "tpyr-dvnc", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nMedical provider confirmed COVID-19 cases and confirmed COVID-19 related deaths in San Francisco, CA aggregated by several different geographic areas and normalized by 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates for population data to calculate rate per 10,000 residents.\n\nOn September 12, 2021, a new case definition of COVID-19 was introduced that includes criteria for enumerating new infections after previous probable or confirmed infections (also known as reinfections). A reinfection is defined as a confirmed positive PCR lab test more than 90 days after a positive PCR or antigen test. The first reinfection case was identified on December 7, 2021.\n\nCases and deaths are both mapped to the residence of the individual, not to where they were infected or died. For example, if one was infected in San Francisco at work but lives in the East Bay, those are not counted as SF Cases or if one dies in Zuckerberg San Francisco General but is from another county, that is also not counted in this dataset.\n\nDataset is cumulative and covers cases going back to 3/2/2020 when testing began. \n\nGeographic areas summarized are:\n1. <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Analysis-Neighborhoods-2020-census-tracts-assigned/sevw-6tgi\">Analysis Neighborhoods</a>\n2. <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Census-2020-Tracts-for-San-Francisco/tmph-tgz9\">Census Tracts</a>\n3. <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html\">Census Zip Code Tabulation Areas</a>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nAddresses from medical data are geocoded by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). Those addresses are spatially joined to the geographic areas. Counts are generated based on the number of address points that match each geographic area. The 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) population estimates provided by the Census are used to create a rate which is equal to <i>([count] / [acs_population]) * 10000)</i> representing the number of cases per 10,000 residents.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nGeographic analysis is scripted by SFDPH staff and synced to this dataset daily at 7:30 Pacific Time. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nSan Francisco population estimates for geographic regions can be found in a <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/35v5-seg9\">view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset</a>. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS).\n\n<em>Privacy rules in effect</em>\nTo protect privacy, certain rules are in effect:\n1. Case counts greater than 0 and less than 10 are dropped - these will be null (blank) values\n2. Death counts greater than 0 and less than 10 are dropped - these will be null (blank) values\n3. Cases and deaths dropped altogether for areas where acs_population < 1000\n\n<em>Rate suppression in effect where counts lower than 20</em>\nRates are not calculated unless the case count is greater than or equal to 20. Rates are generally unstable at small numbers, so we avoid calculating them directly. We advise you to apply the same approach as this is best practice in epidemiology.\n\n<em>A note on Census ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)</em>\nZIP Code Tabulation Areas are special boundaries created by the U.S. Census based on ZIP Codes developed by the USPS. They are not, however, the same thing. ZCTAs are areal representations of routes. <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html\">Read how the Census develops ZCTAs on their website</a>.\n\n<em>Row included for Citywide case counts, incidence rate, and deaths</em>\nA single row is included that has the Citywide case counts and incidence rate. This can be used for comparisons. Citywide will capture all cases regardless of address quality.

{"resource": {"name": "Traffic Crashes Resulting in Injury", "id": "ubvf-ztfx", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis table contains all crashes resulting in an injury in the City of San Francisco. Fatality year-to-date crash data is obtained from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OME) death records, and only includes those cases that meet the San Francisco Vision Zero Fatality Protocol maintained by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH), San Francisco Police Department (SFPD), and San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). Injury crash data is obtained from SFPD\u2019s Interim Collision System for 2018 through the current year-to-date, Crossroads Software Traffic Collision Database (CR) for years 2013-2017 and the Statewide Integrated Transportation Record System (SWITRS) maintained by the California Highway Patrol for all years prior to 2013. Only crashes with valid geographic information are mapped. All geocodable crash data is represented on the simplified San Francisco street centerline model maintained by the Department of Public Works (SFDPW). Collision injury data is queried and aggregated on a quarterly basis. Crashes occurring at complex intersections with multiple roadways are mapped onto a single point and injury and fatality crashes occurring on highways are excluded.\n\nThe crash, party, and victim tables have a relational structure. The traffic crashes table contains information on each crash, one record per crash. The party table contains information from all parties involved in the crashes, one record per party. Parties are individuals involved in a traffic crash including drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and parked vehicles. The victim table contains information about each party injured in the collision, including any passengers. Injury severity is included in the victim table. \n\nFor example, a crash occurs (1 record in the crash table) that involves a driver party and a pedestrian party (2 records in the party table). Only the pedestrian is injured and thus is the only victim (1 record in the victim table). \n\nTo learn more about the traffic injury datasets, see the <u><a href=\"https://tims.berkeley.edu/help/SWITRS.php\">TIMS documentation</a></u>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nTraffic crash injury data is collected from the California Highway Patrol 555 Crash Report as submitted by the police officer within 30 days after the crash occurred. All fields that match the SWITRS data schema are programmatically extracted, de-identified, geocoded, and loaded into TransBASE. See Section D below for details regarding TransBASE. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nAfter review by SFPD and SFDPH staff, the data is made publicly available approximately a month after the end of the previous quarter (May for Q1, August for Q2, November for Q3, and February for Q4). \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis data is being provided as public information as defined under San Francisco and California public records laws. SFDPH, SFMTA, and SFPD cannot limit or restrict the use of this data or its interpretation by other parties in any way. Where the data is communicated, distributed, reproduced, mapped, or used in any other way, the user should acknowledge TransBASE.sfgov.org as the source of the data, provide a reference to the original data source where also applicable, include the date the data was pulled, and note any caveats specified in the associated metadata documentation provided. However, users should not attribute their analysis or interpretation of this data to the City of San Francisco. While the data has been collected and/or produced for the use of the City of San Francisco, it cannot guarantee its accuracy or completeness. Accordingly, the City of San Francisco, including SFDPH, SFMTA, and SFPD make no representation as to the accuracy of the information or its suitability for any purpose and disclaim any liability for omissions or errors that may be contained therein.

{"resource": {"name": "Mpox Cases Over Time", "id": "vi7r-brsi", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset represents probable or confirmed mpox cases among San Francisco residents. Cases are included by the episode date, defined as either the date when self-reported symptoms began or, if that date is not available, the date the positive test was collected (i.e., specimen collection date). \n\nData are lagged by 5 days, meaning that the most recent date of self-reported symptom or specimen collection included is 1 day prior to today. All data update daily as more information becomes available. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCase information is based on confirmed or probable positive laboratory tests reported to the San Francisco Department of Public Health. Processes to provide quality assurance and other data verification are completed before the data are reported. \n\nThis data may not be immediately available for recently reported cases because of the time needed to process tests and validate cases. \n\nData are continually updated to maximize completeness of information and reporting on San Francisco residents with confirmed or probable mpox.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates to the data are made through automated and manual processes once each day, Monday through Friday.  \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset shows new cases and cumulative cases (probable and confirmed) by episode date. Episode date is the date of self-reported symptom onset, or, if not available, date of specimen collection (i.e., the date the person was tested). \n\nNew cases are the count of cases with a symptom onset or specimen collection date on the given episode date.

The Plant Finder recommends appropriate habitat-building plants for sidewalks, gardens and roofs that are adapted to San Francisco's unique environment and climate.\r\n\r\nThe plants in the database include California natives and Mediterranean climate exotics. A large subset of the California natives are actually local San Francisco natives. We strongly recommend local natives since they provide the best habitat for local pollinators and other wildlife with whom they have co-evolved. San Francisco natives are the most closely adapted to the climate and environment of the San Francisco peninsula of course, and so they are the best in terms of water and soil conservation, ecosystem health, and overall sustainability.\r\n\r\nYou can get the geographic ares for plant communities represented in this dataset here: https://data.sfgov.org/d/27u4-a5b3", "attribution": "Cit and County of San Francisco Planning Department", "attribution_link": "http://sfplantfinder.org", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-09-06T00:44:44.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-06-28T17:25:11.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-09-06T00:44:44.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-06-28T17:25:33.000Z", "columns_name": ["Plant_Type", "Bloom_Time", "Sidewalk_Landscaping_Plants", "Thrifty150", "Sandy_Soil_int", "Super60", "Top20_int", "Water_Needs", "Top20", "Former_Latin_Name", "Climate_Appropriate_Plants", "Pruning_Needs", "Stormwater_int", "Nurseries", "Special_List", "Habitat", "Sidewalk_Landscaping_Plants_int", "Super60_int", "Shady_Clay", "Shady_Clay_int", "Sandy_Soil", "Common_Name", "Flower_Color", "Suitable_Site_Conditions", "Soil_Type", "Habitat_Value", "Stormwater_Benefit", "Appropriate_Location", "Suggested_Green_Connection_Routes", "Street_Tree_List", "PhotoCredit01", "PhotoCredit04", "PhotoCredit02", "Additional_Characteristices_Notes", "Associated_Wildlife", "Plant_Communities", "Size_at_Maturity", "PhotoCredit03", "Additional_Species_Cultivars_Varieties", "Habitat_int", "Thrifty150_int", "Latin_Name", "Family_Name"], "columns_field_name": ["plant_type", "bloom_time", "sidewalk_landscaping_plants", "thrifty150", "sandy_soil_int", "super60", "top20_int", "water_needs", "top20", "former_latin_name", "climate_appropriate_plants", "pruning_needs", "stormwater_int", "nurseries", "special_list", "habitat", "sidewalk_landscaping_plants_int", "super60_int", "shady_clay", "shady_clay_int", "sandy_soil", "common_name", "flower_color", "suitable_site_conditions", "soil_type", "habitat_value", "stormwater_benefit", "appropriate_location", "suggested_green_connection_routes", "street_tree_list", "photocredit01", "photocredit04", "photocredit02", "additional_characteristices_notes", "associated_wildlife", "plant_communities", "size_at_maturity", "photocredit03", "additional_species_cultivars_varieties", "habitat_int", "thrifty150_int", "latin_name", "family_name"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-06-28T17:31:59.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Energy and Environment", "domain_tags": ["environment", "green connections", "planning", "plant", "plantfinder", "plants", "sf plant finder"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Department-Metrics_Publishing-Department", "value": "Environment"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Publishing-frequency", "value": "Annually"}, {"key": "Publishing-Details_Data-change-frequency", "value": "Annually"}, {"key": "Detailed-Descriptive_Geographic-unit", "value": "Not applicable"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.sfgov.org", "license": "Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License"}, "permalink": "https://data.sfgov.org/d/vmnk-skih", "link": "https://data.sfgov.org/Energy-and-Environment/San-Francisco-Plant-Finder-Data/vmnk-skih", "owner": {"id": "wh9h-jktj", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "mikewynne"}, "creator": {"id": "wh9h-jktj", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "mikewynne"}}

A pedestrian safety zone is a painted buffered curb-side space between the sidewalk and moving vehicles. Their footprint resembles a bulb out, helping to emphasize that the space should not be treated as part of the roadway. As a low-cost, easily-implemented treatment, painted safety zones enhance pedestrian safety by (1) Improving line of sight between pedestrians and motorists and (2) Providing motorists with visual cues that encourage careful maneuvering near pedestrians. Painted safety zones do not extend the sidewalk, as pedestrians still wait to start their crossing at the existing curb line. However, their future conversion to concrete bulbouts will provide all the benefits of a wider sidewalk.\n\nB.

The reports are categorized into the following groups based on how the report was received and the type of incident:\n\n<strong>Initial Reports</strong>: the first report filed for an incident \n<strong>Coplogic Reports</strong>: incident reports filed by members of the public using SFPD\u2019s online reporting system\n<strong>Vehicle Reports</strong>: any incident reports related to stolen and/or recovered vehicles\n\nDisclaimer: The San Francisco Police Department does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, timeliness or correct sequencing of the information as the data is subject to change as modifications and updates are completed.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nData is added to open data once incident reports have been reviewed and approved by a supervising Sergeant or Lieutenant. Incident reports may be removed from the dataset if in compliance with court orders to seal records or for administrative purposes such as active internal affair investigations and/or criminal investigations.\n\n<a href=\"https://support.datasf.org/help/police-department-incident-reports-2018-to-present-overview\">Read more about how incident reports are created and approved in the detailed overview of this dataset</a>.\n\n<strong>C.

{"resource": {"name": "Dataset inventory", "id": "y8fp-fbf5", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "<strong>Annual Inventory Update Notice</strong>\nWe have updated the inventory with provisional update as of July 1, 2020 based on an initial cleanup and reconciliation of records. DataSF staff are delayed on a full update because of the ongoing COVID-19 response but are working with departments to complete that annual update by end of July.\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThe dataset inventory provides a list of data maintained by departments that are candidates for open data publishing or have already been published and is collected in accordance with Chapter 22D of the Administrative Code. The inventory will be used in conjunction with department publishing plans to track progress toward meeting plan goals for each department. Department publishing plans are available at https://datasf.org/publishing/plans\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis dataset is collated through 2 ways:\n1. Ongoing updates are made throughout the year to reflect new datasets, this process involves DataSF staff reconciling publishing records after datasets are published\n2. Annual bulk updates - departments review their inventories and identify changes and updates and submit those to DataSF for a once a year bulk update - not all departments will have changes or their changes will have been captured over the course of the prior year already as ongoing updates\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe dataset is synced automatically daily, but the underlying data changes manually throughout the year as needed\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\n<em>Interpreting dates in this dataset</em>\nThis dataset has 3 dates:\n1. Date Added - when the dataset was added to the inventory itself\n2. First Published - when the dataset was initially published on the platform\n3. Date Created on Platform - the open data portal automatically captures the date the dataset was first created, this is that system generated date\n\nNote that in certain cases we may have published a dataset prior to it being added to the inventory. We do our best to have an accurate accounting of when something was added to this inventory and when it was published. In most cases the inventory addition will happen prior to publishing, but in certain cases it will be published and we will have missed updating the inventory as this is a manual process. \n\nFirst published will give an  accounting of when it was actually available on the open data catalog and date added when it was added to this list. \n\nDate Created on Platform will show when a dataset was initially created. Because datasets are created and re-created as underlying systems changed, this date can be after the first published date if, for example, there was a new dataset published as an improvement over a previous one. Additionally, for new datasets, this date is often prior to the first published date as it is created, reviewed, QA'd and prepared for release.\n\n<em>Companion systems inventory dataset</em>\nThis is a list of datasets published and unpublished, a companion <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Inventory-of-citywide-enterprise-systems-of-record/ebux-gcnq\">dataset of citywide enterprise systems of record can be accessed online</a> as well.", "attribution": "GSA - City Administrator's Office: DataSF", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-03-27T07:35:02.000Z", "createdAt": "2015-03-26T18:22:56.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-07-01T17:15:04.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-03-27T07:35:02.000Z", "columns_name": ["Date Created on Platform", "Status Notes", "Dataset ID", "Date Added", "Department Priority", "Dataset Name", "Inventory ID", "First Published", "Data Classification", "Department or Division", "Category", "Dataset Description", "Lag", "Value", "Automated By", "Lag Days", "On Time", "Natively Hosted", "Metadata Complete", "Dataset Link", "Publishing Status", "Required Fields Complete", "Data Dictionary or Equivalent", "Publishing Approach"], "columns_field_name": ["date_created_on_platform", "status_notes", "dataset_id", "date_added", "department_priority", "dataset_name", "inventory_id", "first_published", "data_classification", "department_or_division", "category", "dataset_description", "lag", "value", "automated_by", "lag_days", "on_time", "natively_hosted", "metadata_complete", "dataset_link", "publishing_status", "required_fields_complete", "data_dictionary", "publishing_approach"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Checkbox", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Checkbox", "Checkbox", "URL", "Text", "Checkbox", "Checkbox", "Text"], "columns_description": ["This is the date the dataset was created in the platform.

SUMMARY</strong>\nSnapshot of San Francisco's Development Pipeline. Tracking of construction and entitlement activity based on data from Department of Building Inspection's Permit Tracking System and the Planning Department's Project & Permit Tracking System, processed quarterly. For more information please see http://sfplanning.org/pipeline-report\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe dataset is created by combining projects data from the City Planning Department and permit data from the Building Inspection Department to create a quarterly snapshot that shows when a project is filed to construction.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe Development Pipeline is updated as a quarterly snapshot of the construction development in the City of San Francisco.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nEach row or record is a project or permit. They are fitted with information such as address, block lot, project case number and spatial data that allow users to find the specific project. Each row also contains project specific information such as project description and details to illustrate the scope of the project.\n\n<strong>E. DATA NOTES </strong>\n\n<strong>Reporting Update</strong>\nSignificant data and systems improvements are underway to produce a more accurate quarterly pipeline, so the data may change at any time. Weekly and monthly data on Planning Applications and Building Permits can be accessed via the City's Open Data Portal.\n\n<strong>Change in Status Definitions</strong>\nThe following changes have been made in status definitions since the 2022 Q1 Pipeline Report to align the Quarterly Pipeline Reports with other Housing Reports (Housing Inventory and Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) Annual Progress)  <br>\n<strong> (1) Construction: </strong> projects that are authorized for construction deemed to be in the construction stage. A project is considered to be authorized for construction if it has:\no\tan issued full building permit, OR<br>\no\tan issued site permit with an approved first construction document<br>\nPast definition: projects that had their first inspection were deemed to be in the construction stage.<br>\n<strong> (2) Building Permit Issued: </strong> includes projects that have an issued site permit but don\u2019t yet have their first construction document. Housing units for these projects are not yet counted toward RHNA progress.<br>\nPast definition: included projects with any type of permit (site or full building permit) in the issued status.\n\nA data dictionary can be downloaded from the following link: \nhttps://sfplanninggis.s3.amazonaws.com/PipelineDataDictionary_10262022.xlsx", "attribution": "City and County of San Francisco, City Planning Department", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-12-22T00:56:01.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-12-13T21:27:46.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-12-22T00:56:01.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-12-13T21:35:39.000Z", "columns_name": ["BLKLOT", "DESCRIPT", "BPAPPLNO", "CASENO", "TENURE_TYPE", "AFF_TARGET", "Aff_Projection", "AFFORDABLENET", "Pipeline_Units", "Lat/Long", "QTR", "Longitude", "PLANS", "SUD", "PDA", "HEIGHT_BUL", "ZONING", "NHOOD_41", "NHOOD_37", "PD", "DA", "CONTACTPH", "CONTACT", "SPONSOR", "PLANNER", "State Density ALL", "VISITNET", "VISIT", "VISIT_EXIST", "RETNET", "RET", "RET_EXIST", "PDRNET", "PDR", "PDR_EXIST", "HOTEL_ROOM_NET", "ADU", "MIPS_EXIST", "SD22", "MIPSNET", "MIPS", "MEDNET", "MED_EXIST", "CIENET", "CIE", "NET_GSF", "BESTSTAT", "MED", "YEAR_QTR", "CIE_EXIST", "Latitude", "UNITS", "YEAR", "LANDUSE", "HOTEL_ROOM_PROP", "SECTION415", "HOTEL_ROOM_EXIST", "LEGALIZATION", "Neighborhoods", "SF Find Neighborhoods", "Current Police Districts", "Current Supervisor Districts", "Analysis Neighborhoods", "ObjectID", "DBIDESC", "NAMEADDR", "Entitled", "BESTDATE", "TCOCFC_DATE", "TCOCFC_UNITS", "UNITSNET", "TOTAL_GSF"], "columns_field_name": ["blklot", "descript", "bpapplno", "caseno", "tenure_type", "aff_target", "aff_projection", "affordablenet", "pipeline_units", "lat_long", "qtr", "longitude", "plans", "sud", "pda", "height_bul", "zoning", "nhood_41", "nhood_37", "pd", "da", "contactph", "contact", "sponsor", "planner", "state_density_all", "visitnet", "visit", "visit_exist", "retnet", "ret", "ret_exist", "pdrnet", "pdr", "pdr_exist", "hotel_room_net", "adu", "mips_exist", "sd22", "mipsnet", "mips", "mednet", "med_exist", "cienet", "cie", "net_gsf", "beststat", "med", "year_qtr", "cie_exist", "latitude", "units", "year", "landuse", "hotel_room_prop", "section415", "hotel_room_exist", "legalization", ":@computed_region_jwn9_ihcz", ":@computed_region_6qbp_sg9q", ":@computed_region_qgnn_b9vv", ":@computed_region_26cr_cadq", ":@computed_region_ajp5_b2md", "objectid", "dbidesc", "nameaddr", "entitled", "bestdate", "tcocfc_date", "tcocfc_units", "unitsnet", "total_gsf"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Point", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Checkbox", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Checkbox", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Checkbox", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "This column was automatically created in order to record in what polygon from the dataset 'Neighborhoods' (jwn9-ihcz) the point in column 'lat_long' is located.

SUMMARY</strong>\n\n<strong><i>Please note that the \"Data Last Updated\" date on this page denotes the most recent DataSF update and does not reflect the most recent update to this dataset. To confirm the completeness of this dataset please contact the District Attorney's office at <u><a href=\u201dmailto:districtattorney@sfgov.org\u201d>districtattorney@sfgov.org</a></u>.</strong></i>\n\nThis data set includes all criminal cases prosecuted by the District Attorney\u2019s Office that have reached a final resolution, or disposition. A case is resolved when a final determination has been made in court (i.e., an acquittal, conviction, dismissal, or a judge finds a defendant has successfully completed diversion).\n\nA case may also be resolved through other means. For example, a case may be re-indicted, a defendant may be released to another agency's custody, etc. Because of the case tracking systems used in the San Francisco Superior Court, these cases are assigned new court numbers and thus show up as distinct cases in the data available to the District Attorney\u2019s Office. Lastly, sometimes a defendant will have multiple criminal cases related to the same incident or similar types of crimes. The defendant may plead guilty to one case, and in exchange, the other cases will be dropped. The San Francisco Superior Court codes these cases as \"1385 PC - Guilty Plea to Other Charge\".\n\nMore information about this dataset can be found under the \u201cCase Resolutions\u201d section on the <u><a href=\"https://sfdistrictattorney.org/policy/data-dashboards/#case-resolutions\">Data Dashboards page</a></u>\n\n<strong><i>Disclaimer: The San Francisco District Attorney's Office does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information as the data is subject to change as modifications and updates are completed.</strong></i>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\n\nWhen a case prosecuted by the District Attorney\u2019s Office reaches a final resolution, or disposition, relevant data is manually entered into the District Attorney Office's case management system. Data reports are pulled from this system on a semi-regular basis, cleaned, anonymized, and added to Open Data.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\n\nWe strive to update this dataset at the beginning of every week. However, the creation of this dataset requires a manual pull from the Office's case management system and is dependent on staff availability.\n\n<strong>D.

The centroid of each footprint was used to join a property identifier from a draft of the San Francisco Enterprise GIS Program's cartographic base, which provides continuous coverage with distinct right-of-way areas as well as selected nearby parcels from adjacent counties.

HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nEach row or record is a project or permit. They are fitted with information such as address, block lot, project case number and spatial data that allow users to find the specific project. Each row also contains project specific information such as project description and details to illustrate the scope of the project.\n\n<strong>E. DATA NOTES </strong>\n\n<strong>Reporting Update</strong>\nSignificant data and systems improvements are underway to produce a more accurate quarterly pipeline, so the data may change at any time. Weekly and monthly data on Planning Applications and Building Permits can be accessed via the City's Open Data Portal.\n\n<strong>Change in Status Definitions</strong>\nThe following changes have been made in status definitions since the 2022 Q1 Pipeline Report to align the Quarterly Pipeline Reports with other Housing Reports (Housing Inventory and Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) Annual Progress)  <br>\n<strong> (1) Construction: </strong> projects that are authorized for construction deemed to be in the construction stage. A project is considered to be authorized for construction if it has:\no\tan issued full building permit, OR<br>\no\tan issued site permit with an approved first construction document<br>\nPast definition: projects that had their first inspection were deemed to be in the construction stage.<br>\n<strong> (2) Building Permit Issued: </strong> includes projects that have an issued site permit but don\u2019t yet have their first construction document. Housing units for these projects are not yet counted toward RHNA progress.<br>\nPast definition: included projects with any type of permit (site or full building permit) in the issued status.\n\nA data dictionary can be downloaded from the following link: \nhttps://sfplanninggis.s3.amazonaws.com/PipelineDataDictionary_10262022.xlsx", "attribution": "City and County of San Francisco, City Planning Department", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-12-01T02:41:39.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-12-01T02:26:46.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-12-01T02:41:39.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-12-01T02:41:27.000Z", "columns_name": ["Neighborhoods", "Current Police Districts", "Current Supervisor Districts", "Analysis Neighborhoods", "ObjectID", "LANDUSE", "BLKLOT", "NAMEADDR", "Entitled", "BESTSTAT", "BESTDATE", "UNITS", "TCOCFC_DATE", "TCOCFC_UNITS", "UNITSNET", "Pipeline_Units", "AFFORDABLENET", "Aff_Projection", "SECTION415", "AFF_TARGET", "TENURE_TYPE", "CASENO", "BPAPPLNO", "DESCRIPT", "DBIDESC", "TOTAL_GSF", "NET_GSF", "CIE_EXIST", "CIE", "CIENET", "MED_EXIST", "MED", "MEDNET", "MIPS_EXIST", "MIPS", "MIPSNET", "PDR_EXIST", "PDR", "PDRNET", "RET_EXIST", "RET", "RETNET", "VISIT_EXIST", "VISIT", "VISITNET", "HOTEL_ROOM_EXIST", "HOTEL_ROOM_PROP", "HOTEL_ROOM_NET", "PLANNER", "SPONSOR", "CONTACT", "CONTACTPH", "DA", "LEGALIZATION", "ADU", "PD", "SD22", "NHOOD_37", "NHOOD_41", "ZONING", "HEIGHT_BUL", "PDA", "SUD", "PLANS", "Longitude", "Latitude", "YEAR", "QTR", "YEAR_QTR", "Lat/Long", "State Density ALL", "SF Find Neighborhoods"], "columns_field_name": [":@computed_region_jwn9_ihcz", ":@computed_region_qgnn_b9vv", ":@computed_region_26cr_cadq", ":@computed_region_ajp5_b2md", "objectid", "landuse", "blklot", "nameaddr", "entitled", "beststat", "bestdate", "units", "tcocfc_date", "tcocfc_units", "unitsnet", "pipeline_units", "affordablenet", "aff_projection", "section415", "aff_target", "tenure_type", "caseno", "bpapplno", "descript", "dbidesc", "total_gsf", "net_gsf", "cie_exist", "cie", "cienet", "med_exist", "med", "mednet", "mips_exist", "mips", "mipsnet", "pdr_exist", "pdr", "pdrnet", "ret_exist", "ret", "retnet", "visit_exist", "visit", "visitnet", "hotel_room_exist", "hotel_room_prop", "hotel_room_net", "planner", "sponsor", "contact", "contactph", "da", "legalization", "adu", "pd", "sd22", "nhood_37", "nhood_41", "zoning", "height_bul", "pda", "sud", "plans", "longitude", "latitude", "year", "qtr", "year_qtr", "lat_long", "state_density_all", ":@computed_region_6qbp_sg9q"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Checkbox", "Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Checkbox", "Checkbox", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Point", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["This column was automatically created in order to record in what polygon from the dataset 'Neighborhoods' (jwn9-ihcz) the point in column 'lat_long' is located.
