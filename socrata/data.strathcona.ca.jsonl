The census gathers information such as the number of people who live in the home, their ages and gender; the type of dwelling; and length of residency in Strathcona County. An up-to-date census count ensures the County receives the maximum grant dollars based on population. These dollars go toward municipal programs such as roads, transit, and community and family services. Census information is also used to plan for future services and programs.\nThe GIS Branch may use the household data for analysis; however, areas containing less than 50 people will not be reported. This practice is in line with Statistics Canada reporting. The data is not available directly to Strathcona County staff but is available upon request and permission from LLS. The data is not shared publicly at the household level.", "attribution": "Strathcona County", "attribution_link": "http://www.strathcona.ca", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt":
