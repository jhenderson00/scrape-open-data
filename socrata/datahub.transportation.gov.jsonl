Users can filter based on characteristics like manufacturer and component. The dataset can also be filtered by recall type: tires, vehicles, car seats, and equipment. The earliest campaign data is from 1966. The dataset displays the completion rate from the latest Recall Quarterly Report or Annual Report data from Year 2015 Quarter 1 (2015-1) onward.\n\nData Reporting Requirement:\nManufacturers who determine that a product or piece of original equipment either contains a safety defect or is not in compliance with Federal safety standards are required to notify NHTSA within 5 business days. NHTSA requires that manufacturers file a Defect and Noncompliance Report in compliance with Federal Regulation 49 (the National Traffic and Motor Safety Act) Part 573, which identifies the requirements for safety recalls. This information is stored in the NHTSA database referenced above.\n\nNotes:\nThe default visualization depicted here represents only the top 12 manufacturers for the current calendar year.
