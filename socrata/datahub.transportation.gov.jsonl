Users can filter based on characteristics like manufacturer and component. The dataset can also be filtered by recall type: tires, vehicles, car seats, and equipment. The earliest campaign data is from 1966. The dataset displays the completion rate from the latest Recall Quarterly Report or Annual Report data from Year 2015 Quarter 1 (2015-1) onward.\n\nData Reporting Requirement:\nManufacturers who determine that a product or piece of original equipment either contains a safety defect or is not in compliance with Federal safety standards are required to notify NHTSA within 5 business days. NHTSA requires that manufacturers file a Defect and Noncompliance Report in compliance with Federal Regulation 49 (the National Traffic and Motor Safety Act) Part 573, which identifies the requirements for safety recalls. This information is stored in the NHTSA database referenced above.\n\nNotes:\nThe default visualization depicted here represents only the top 12 manufacturers for the current calendar year.

This table only lists airport markets where the origin or destination airport is an airport that has other commercial airports in the same city. Midway Airport (MDW) and O'Hare (ORD) are examples of this.  All records are aggregated as directionless markets.  The combination of Airport_1 and Airport_2 define the airport pair market.  All traffic traveling in both directions is added together.\n\nhttps://www.transportation.gov/policy/aviation-policy/competition-data-analysis/research-reports", "attribution": "Department of Transportation Office of the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs", "attribution_link": "https://www.transportation.gov/policy/aviation-policy/competition-data-analysis/research-reports", "contact_email": "Randall.Keizer@dot.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-10-16T16:25:43.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-04-03T18:47:04.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-10-16T16:25:40.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-10-16T16:25:43.000Z", "columns_name": ["Geocoded_City2 (address)", "lf_ms", "large_ms", "passengers", "city1", "Geocoded_City2 (city)", "Geocoded_City1 (state)", "Geocoded_City1", "fare_low", "carrier_low", "carrier_lg", "airport_2", "airport_1", "airportid_2", "city2", "citymarketid_1", "Year", "fare", "airportid_1", "citymarketid_2", "Geocoded_City1 (address)", "nsmiles", "quarter", "Geocoded_City2", "fare_lg", "Geocoded_City2 (state)", "Geocoded_City2 (zip)", "Geocoded_City1 (zip)", "tbl", "tbl1apk", "Geocoded_City1 (city)"], "columns_field_name": ["location_2_address", "lf_ms", "large_ms", "passengers", "city1", "location_2_city", "location_1_state", "location_1", "fare_low", "carrier_low", "carrier_lg", "airport_2", "airport_1", "airportid_2", "city2", "citymarketid_1", "year", "fare", "airportid_1", "citymarketid_2", "location_1_address", "nsmiles", "quarter", "location_2", "fare_lg", "location_2_state", "location_2_zip", "location_1_zip", "tbl", "tbl1apk", "location_1_city"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Point", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Point", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "Market share for the lowest carrier", "Market share for the carrier with the largest market share", "Passenger per day", "City1 is used to consolidate airports serving the same city market", "", "", "Geocoded - City1 is used to consolidate airports serving the same city market with Latitude and Longitude", "Average fare for the lowest carrier", "Carrier with the lowest fare", "Carrier with the largest market share", "Airport code", "Airport code", "Airport ID is an identification number assigned by US DOT\nto identify a airport.", "City2 is used to consolidate airports serving the same city market", "City market ID is an identification number assigned by US DOT\nto identify a city market.

The Federal Highway Administration\u2019s Turner Fairbank Highway Research Center (TFHRC), in conjunction with the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center,  tested and evaluated this prototype system in 2016. Researchers in the Saxton Transportation Operations Laboratory at TFHRC designed and built the Cooperative Automated Research Mobility Applications (CARMA) platform version 1 that enables the implementation of the proof-of-concept CACC-based platooning in passenger vehicles equipped with production adaptive cruise control, and vehicle-to-vehicle communications using dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). The data characterize the state-of-the-art capability of the CACC application based on engineering tests that were performed on closed tracks by professional drivers and using prescribed test procedures. The test data are separated into sets that correspond to test date and time, and test run number. The data include performance parameters that were collected from the CACC application and data acquisition systems, including vehicle controller area network data, CARMA's MicroAutoBox, DSRC radios, and an independent measurement system.
