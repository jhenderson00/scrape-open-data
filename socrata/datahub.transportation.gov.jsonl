Users can filter based on characteristics like manufacturer and component. The dataset can also be filtered by recall type: tires, vehicles, car seats, and equipment. The earliest campaign data is from 1966. The dataset displays the completion rate from the latest Recall Quarterly Report or Annual Report data from Year 2015 Quarter 1 (2015-1) onward.\n\nData Reporting Requirement:\nManufacturers who determine that a product or piece of original equipment either contains a safety defect or is not in compliance with Federal safety standards are required to notify NHTSA within 5 business days. NHTSA requires that manufacturers file a Defect and Noncompliance Report in compliance with Federal Regulation 49 (the National Traffic and Motor Safety Act) Part 573, which identifies the requirements for safety recalls. This information is stored in the NHTSA database referenced above.\n\nNotes:\nThe default visualization depicted here represents only the top 12 manufacturers for the current calendar year.

The SourceId field determines which quality check is depicted in this field. \nFor SourceId = 1, this field depicts the Complete Test which test indicates whether that all of the WxDE quality check calculations configured for each observation type are done with their work.\nFor SourceId = 2, this field depicts the Combined Algorithm Test which is designed to take the results of all the previous quality check tests and combine them in order to assign a confidence to the observation that is being quality checked. It does not equate directly to pass/fail as do the other tests. Sensor Range Test. The sensor range test detects readings that fall outside the range of sensor hardware specifications or theoretical limits (i.e., a maximum and minimum value). If the observation value is greater than or equal to the minimum, and less than or equal to the maximum, the sensor reading passes this quality check.\nQuality checking results are interpreted from the output as follows:\n\"P\" - The observation passed the quality check.\n\"N\" - The observation did not pass the quality check.\n\"/\" - The quality check was not configured to run for the observation type.\n", "This field contains the quality check confidence value. This field is a number that is representative of the quality check performed on the data record across multiple criteria. An algorithm is run to evaluate the results of all the quality checking.

For each Path History point, the lat-long offset units support units of 1/10th micro degrees of lat and long. The elevation offset units are in 10cm units. The time is expressed in units of 10 milliseconds. The PositionalAccuracy entry uses 3 elements to relate the pseudorange noise measured in the system.

This table only lists airport markets where the origin or destination airport is an airport that has other commercial airports in the same city. Midway Airport (MDW) and O'Hare (ORD) are examples of this.  All records are aggregated as directionless markets.  The combination of Airport_1 and Airport_2 define the airport pair market.  All traffic traveling in both directions is added together.\n\nhttps://www.transportation.gov/policy/aviation-policy/competition-data-analysis/research-reports", "attribution": "Department of Transportation Office of the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs", "attribution_link": "https://www.transportation.gov/policy/aviation-policy/competition-data-analysis/research-reports", "contact_email": "Randall.Keizer@dot.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-10-16T16:25:43.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-04-03T18:47:04.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-10-16T16:25:40.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-10-16T16:25:43.000Z", "columns_name": ["airportid_2", "carrier_lg", "carrier_low", "tbl", "Geocoded_City1 (zip)", "Geocoded_City2 (zip)", "Geocoded_City2 (state)", "fare_lg", "fare_low", "Geocoded_City1", "Geocoded_City1 (state)", "lf_ms", "city2", "citymarketid_1", "Year", "fare", "large_ms", "Geocoded_City2 (city)", "Geocoded_City1 (city)", "Geocoded_City2 (address)", "Geocoded_City2", "city1", "quarter", "passengers", "nsmiles", "Geocoded_City1 (address)", "airportid_1", "tbl1apk", "citymarketid_2", "airport_1", "airport_2"], "columns_field_name": ["airportid_2", "carrier_lg", "carrier_low", "tbl", "location_1_zip", "location_2_zip", "location_2_state", "fare_lg", "fare_low", "location_1", "location_1_state", "lf_ms", "city2", "citymarketid_1", "year", "fare", "large_ms", "location_2_city", "location_1_city", "location_2_address", "location_2", "city1", "quarter", "passengers", "nsmiles", "location_1_address", "airportid_1", "tbl1apk", "citymarketid_2", "airport_1", "airport_2"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Point", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Point", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Airport ID is an identification number assigned by US DOT\nto identify a airport.", "Carrier with the largest market share", "Carrier with the lowest fare", "Name of data table", "", "", "", "Average fare for the carrier with the largest market share", "Average fare for the lowest carrier", "Geocoded - City1 is used to consolidate airports serving the same city market with Latitude and Longitude", "", "Market share for the lowest carrier", "City2 is used to consolidate airports serving the same city market", "City market ID is an identification number assigned by US DOT\nto identify a city market.

The Federal Highway Administration\u2019s Turner Fairbank Highway Research Center (TFHRC), in conjunction with the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center,  tested and evaluated this prototype system in 2016. Researchers in the Saxton Transportation Operations Laboratory at TFHRC designed and built the Cooperative Automated Research Mobility Applications (CARMA) platform version 1 that enables the implementation of the proof-of-concept CACC-based platooning in passenger vehicles equipped with production adaptive cruise control, and vehicle-to-vehicle communications using dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). The data characterize the state-of-the-art capability of the CACC application based on engineering tests that were performed on closed tracks by professional drivers and using prescribed test procedures. The test data are separated into sets that correspond to test date and time, and test run number. The data include performance parameters that were collected from the CACC application and data acquisition systems, including vehicle controller area network data, CARMA's MicroAutoBox, DSRC radios, and an independent measurement system. The tests were conducted at US Army\u2019s Aberdeen Test Center located at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD.
