Users can filter based on characteristics like manufacturer and component. The dataset can also be filtered by recall type: tires, vehicles, car seats, and equipment. The earliest campaign data is from 1966. The dataset displays the completion rate from the latest Recall Quarterly Report or Annual Report data from Year 2015 Quarter 1 (2015-1) onward.\n\nData Reporting Requirement:\nManufacturers who determine that a product or piece of original equipment either contains a safety defect or is not in compliance with Federal safety standards are required to notify NHTSA within 5 business days. NHTSA requires that manufacturers file a Defect and Noncompliance Report in compliance with Federal Regulation 49 (the National Traffic and Motor Safety Act) Part 573, which identifies the requirements for safety recalls. This information is stored in the NHTSA database referenced above.\n\nNotes:\nThe default visualization depicted here represents only the top 12 manufacturers for the current calendar year.

Specifically, the standard deviation and the mean of the observations along a 1-mile road segment during a 5-minute snapshot are taken, and then each observation is checked if it falls within a standard deviation, multiplied by a constant, of the mean of the road segment.\nQuality checking results are interpreted from the output as follows:\n\"P\" - The observation passed the quality check.\n\"N\" - The observation did not pass the quality check.\n\"-\" - The quality check was not run for the observation, usually due to insufficient background field data.\n\"/\" - The quality check was not configured to run for the observation type.\n", "This field contains the flag for a quality check for each data record. The SourceId field determines which quality check is depicted in this field. \nFor SourceId = 1, this field depicts the Like Instrument Test. This test verifies that observations from similar sensors on the same platform are within tolerance to each other.\nFor SourceId = 2, this field depicts the Persistence Test which detects whether sensor readings remain constant for a predefined period of time, which varies depending on the observation type. Consecutive sensor readings from the same sensor over the defined period preceding the current observation time are obtained. If one or more of the consecutive sensor values are different, the current sensor reading passes the persistence quality check. If all consecutive sensor values over the given time period are equivalent, the current sensor does not pass the persistence quality check.\nQuality checking results are interpreted from the output as follows:\n\"-\" - The quality check was not run for the observation, usually due to insufficient background field data.\n\"/\" - The quality check was not configured to run for the observation type.\n", "This field contains the name of the metric unit for the observation.\n\n"], "columns_format": [{"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"view": "address_coords", "align": "left"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"view": "date_time", "align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-11-14T22:33:08.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["infrastructure", "economy", "social services"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Automobiles", "domain_tags": ["arterial", "basic safety message (bsm)", "belle isle park", "connected vehicle data", "connected vehicles", "environment sensor stations", "fhwa road weather management program", "integrated mobile observation", "integrated mobile observation (imo)", "intelligent transportation systems (its)", "its joint program office (jpo)", "its world congress", "michigan", "michigan department of transportation (mdot)", "motorist advisories and warnings", "road weather demonstration", "sensor data", "simulated road weather", "vehicle data translator", "weather"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Email", "value": "Gene.McHale@dot.gov"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Last-Update", "value": "2015-05-07"}, {"key": "Common-Core_License", "value": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "021:013"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Public-Access-Level", "value": "public"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Temporal-Applicability", "value": "2014-09-05/2014-09-11"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Is-Quality-Data", "value": "True"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Geographic-Coverage", "value": "Belle Isle, Detroit, Michigan,"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "USDOT"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "irregular"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "021:15"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Issued", "value": "2015-05-07"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Name", "value": "Gene McHale"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "datahub.transportation.gov", "license": "Creative Commons Attribution | Noncommercial | Share Alike 3.0 Unported"}, "permalink": "https://datahub.transportation.gov/d/jc5e-psbx", "link": "https://datahub.transportation.gov/Automobiles/Road-Weather-Demonstration-Data/jc5e-psbx", "owner": {"id": "6iy3-3vyr", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "kathythompson"}, "creator": {"id": "6iy3-3vyr", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "kathythompson"}}

One use of this data is for reference in understanding ridership patterns (e.g., to develop to a full month estimate ahead of when the data reflecting the given month of service is released by FTA at the end of the following month). \n\nGenerally, FTA has defined the reference week to be the second or third full week of the month. All sampled agencies will report data referencing the same reference week. \n\nThe form collects the following service data points, as described in the metadata below: \n\u2022\tWeekday 5-day UPT total for the reference week; \n\u2022\tWeekday 5-day VRM total for the reference week; \n\u2022\tWeekend 2-day UPT total for either the weekend preceding or following the reference week; and \n\u2022\tWeekend 2-day VRM total for either the weekend preceding or following the reference week. \n\u2022\tVehicles Operated in Maximum Service (vanpool mode only) for the reference week.\n\nFTA has also derived the change from the prior month for the same agency/mode/type of service/data point.

The Federal Highway Administration\u2019s Turner Fairbank Highway Research Center (TFHRC), in conjunction with the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center,  tested and evaluated this prototype system in 2016. Researchers in the Saxton Transportation Operations Laboratory at TFHRC designed and built the Cooperative Automated Research Mobility Applications (CARMA) platform version 1 that enables the implementation of the proof-of-concept CACC-based platooning in passenger vehicles equipped with production adaptive cruise control, and vehicle-to-vehicle communications using dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). The data characterize the state-of-the-art capability of the CACC application based on engineering tests that were performed on closed tracks by professional drivers and using prescribed test procedures. The test data are separated into sets that correspond to test date and time, and test run number. The data include performance parameters that were collected from the CACC application and data acquisition systems, including vehicle controller area network data, CARMA's MicroAutoBox, DSRC radios, and an independent measurement system.
