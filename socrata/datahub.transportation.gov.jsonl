Users can filter based on characteristics like manufacturer and component. The dataset can also be filtered by recall type: tires, vehicles, car seats, and equipment. The earliest campaign data is from 1966. The dataset displays the completion rate from the latest Recall Quarterly Report or Annual Report data from Year 2015 Quarter 1 (2015-1) onward.\n\nData Reporting Requirement:\nManufacturers who determine that a product or piece of original equipment either contains a safety defect or is not in compliance with Federal safety standards are required to notify NHTSA within 5 business days. NHTSA requires that manufacturers file a Defect and Noncompliance Report in compliance with Federal Regulation 49 (the National Traffic and Motor Safety Act) Part 573, which identifies the requirements for safety recalls. This information is stored in the NHTSA database referenced above.\n\nNotes:\nThe default visualization depicted here represents only the top 12 manufacturers for the current calendar year.

This field is based on the J2735 Standard.", "BSM Part Two Supplemental Vehicle Extension basic vehicle role - provides a means to indicate the current role that a DSRC device is playing. This is most commonly employed when a vehicle needs to take on another role in order to send certain DSRC message types. As an example, when a public safety vehicle such as a police car wishes to send a signal request message (SRM) to an intersection to request a preemption service, the vehicle takes on the role \"police\" from the below list in both the SRM message itself and also in the type of security CERT which is sent (the SSP in the CERT it used to identify the requester as being of type \"police\" and that they are allowed to send this message in this way). The BasicVehicleRole entry is often used and combined with other information about the requester as well, such as details of why the request is being made. Use role \"transit\"for both HART buses and for TECO streetcars.

Because this value is used as a means to identify the local vehicles that are interacting during an encounter, it is used in the message set. Other devices, such as infrastructure (RSUs), may have a fixed value for the temporary ID value. See also DE_StationID which is used in other deployment regions.

A sender may initialize this element to any value in the range 0-127 when sending the first message with a given DSRCmsgID, or if the sender has changed identity (e.g. by changing its TemporaryID) since sending the most recent message with that DSRCmsgID. Depending on the application the sequence number may change with every message or may remain fixed during a stream of messages when the content within each message has not changed from the prior message sent. For this element, the value after 127 is zero.

{"resource": {"name": "Weekly Transit Service Reference Data", "id": "tnfy-euyi", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Beginning in 2023, certain agencies are required to submit one week of service data on a monthly basis to comply with FTA\u2019s Weekly Reference reporting requirement on form WE-20. This data release will therefore present the limited set of key indicators reported by transit agencies on this form and will be updated each month with the most current data.\n\nThe resulting dataset provides data users with data shortly after the transit service was provided and consumed, over one month in advance of FTA\u2019s routine update to the Monthly Ridership Time Series dataset. One use of this data is for reference in understanding ridership patterns (e.g., to develop to a full month estimate ahead of when the data reflecting the given month of service is released by FTA at the end of the following month). \n\nGenerally, FTA has defined the reference week to be the second or third full week of the month. All sampled agencies will report data referencing the same reference week. \n\nThe form collects the following service data points, as described in the metadata below: \n\u2022\tWeekday 5-day UPT total for the reference week; \n\u2022\tWeekday 5-day VRM total for the reference week; \n\u2022\tWeekend 2-day UPT total for either the weekend preceding or following the reference week; and \n\u2022\tWeekend 2-day VRM total for either the weekend preceding or following the reference week. \n\u2022\tVehicles Operated in Maximum Service (vanpool mode only) for the reference week.\n\nFTA has also derived the change from the prior month for the same agency/mode/type of service/data point. Users should take caution when aggregating this measure and are encouraged to use the dataset export to measure service trends at a higher level (i.e., by reporter or nationally).\n\nFor any questions regarding this dataset, please contact the NTD helpdesk at ntdhelp@dot.gov .", "attribution": "Federal Transit Administration", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "NTDHelp@dot.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-03-06T20:08:25.000Z", "createdAt": "2023-11-28T20:29:25.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-03-06T20:08:17.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-03-06T20:08:25.000Z", "columns_name": ["Begin Date", "UACE Code", "Agency Name", "UZA Name", "Change from Prior Month", "Type of Service", "Data Point", "Mode", "Value", "NTD ID", "Reported By", "End Date"], "columns_field_name": ["begin_date", "uace_code", "reporter_name", "uza_name", "percentage_change", "type_of_service", "data_point", "mode", "value", "ntd_id", "reported_by", "end_date"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date"], "columns_description": ["The first day of the reference week over which data is collected.

The Federal Highway Administration\u2019s Turner Fairbank Highway Research Center (TFHRC), in conjunction with the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center,  tested and evaluated this prototype system in 2016. Researchers in the Saxton Transportation Operations Laboratory at TFHRC designed and built the Cooperative Automated Research Mobility Applications (CARMA) platform version 1 that enables the implementation of the proof-of-concept CACC-based platooning in passenger vehicles equipped with production adaptive cruise control, and vehicle-to-vehicle communications using dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). The data characterize the state-of-the-art capability of the CACC application based on engineering tests that were performed on closed tracks by professional drivers and using prescribed test procedures. The test data are separated into sets that correspond to test date and time, and test run number. The data include performance parameters that were collected from the CACC application and data acquisition systems, including vehicle controller area network data, CARMA's MicroAutoBox, DSRC radios, and an independent measurement system. The tests were conducted at US Army\u2019s Aberdeen Test Center located at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD.
