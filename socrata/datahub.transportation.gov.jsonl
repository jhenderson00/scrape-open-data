Users can filter based on characteristics like manufacturer and component. The dataset can also be filtered by recall type: tires, vehicles, car seats, and equipment. The earliest campaign data is from 1966. The dataset displays the completion rate from the latest Recall Quarterly Report or Annual Report data from Year 2015 Quarter 1 (2015-1) onward.\n\nData Reporting Requirement:\nManufacturers who determine that a product or piece of original equipment either contains a safety defect or is not in compliance with Federal safety standards are required to notify NHTSA within 5 business days. NHTSA requires that manufacturers file a Defect and Noncompliance Report in compliance with Federal Regulation 49 (the National Traffic and Motor Safety Act) Part 573, which identifies the requirements for safety recalls. This information is stored in the NHTSA database referenced above.\n\nNotes:\nThe default visualization depicted here represents only the top 12 manufacturers for the current calendar year.

This table only lists airport markets where the origin or destination airport is an airport that has other commercial airports in the same city. Midway Airport (MDW) and O'Hare (ORD) are examples of this.  All records are aggregated as directionless markets.  The combination of Airport_1 and Airport_2 define the airport pair market.  All traffic traveling in both directions is added together.\n\nhttps://www.transportation.gov/policy/aviation-policy/competition-data-analysis/research-reports", "attribution": "Department of Transportation Office of the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs", "attribution_link": "https://www.transportation.gov/policy/aviation-policy/competition-data-analysis/research-reports", "contact_email": "Randall.Keizer@dot.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-10-16T16:25:43.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-04-03T18:47:04.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-10-16T16:25:40.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-10-16T16:25:43.000Z", "columns_name": ["Geocoded_City2", "Geocoded_City1 (zip)", "tbl1apk", "Geocoded_City2 (address)", "tbl", "nsmiles", "Geocoded_City1 (city)", "quarter", "lf_ms", "Geocoded_City2 (zip)", "Geocoded_City2 (state)", "large_ms", "passengers", "city1", "Geocoded_City2 (city)", "Geocoded_City1 (state)", "Geocoded_City1", "fare_low", "carrier_low", "carrier_lg", "airport_2", "airport_1", "airportid_2", "city2", "citymarketid_1", "Year", "fare", "airportid_1", "citymarketid_2", "Geocoded_City1 (address)", "fare_lg"], "columns_field_name": ["location_2", "location_1_zip", "tbl1apk", "location_2_address", "tbl", "nsmiles", "location_1_city", "quarter", "lf_ms", "location_2_zip", "location_2_state", "large_ms", "passengers", "city1", "location_2_city", "location_1_state", "location_1", "fare_low", "carrier_low", "carrier_lg", "airport_2", "airport_1", "airportid_2", "city2", "citymarketid_1", "year", "fare", "airportid_1", "citymarketid_2", "location_1_address", "fare_lg"], "columns_datatype": ["Point", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Point", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Geocoded - City2 is used to consolidate airports serving the same city market with Latitude and Longitude", "", "Primary Key for Table 1a,  Unique ID", "", "Name of data table", "Non-Stop market miles (using radian measure)", "", "Quarter", "Market share for the lowest carrier", "", "", "Market share for the carrier with the largest market share", "Passenger per day", "City1 is used to consolidate airports serving the same city market", "", "", "Geocoded - City1 is used to consolidate airports serving the same city market with Latitude and Longitude", "Average fare for the lowest carrier", "Carrier with the lowest fare", "Carrier with the largest market share", "Airport code", "Airport code", "Airport ID is an identification number assigned by US DOT\nto identify a airport.", "City2 is used to consolidate airports serving the same city market", "City market ID is an identification number assigned by US DOT\nto identify a city market.
