Users can filter based on characteristics like manufacturer and component. The dataset can also be filtered by recall type: tires, vehicles, car seats, and equipment. The earliest campaign data is from 1966. The dataset displays the completion rate from the latest Recall Quarterly Report or Annual Report data from Year 2015 Quarter 1 (2015-1) onward.\n\nData Reporting Requirement:\nManufacturers who determine that a product or piece of original equipment either contains a safety defect or is not in compliance with Federal safety standards are required to notify NHTSA within 5 business days. NHTSA requires that manufacturers file a Defect and Noncompliance Report in compliance with Federal Regulation 49 (the National Traffic and Motor Safety Act) Part 573, which identifies the requirements for safety recalls. This information is stored in the NHTSA database referenced above.\n\nNotes:\nThe default visualization depicted here represents only the top 12 manufacturers for the current calendar year.

This test is an application of the Barnes Spatial Test to dew point temperature values that are computed from air temperature and relative humidity values on the same platform.\nFor SourceId = 2, this field depicts the Spatial Test \u2013 Barnes and Interquartile Range (IQR) which are quality checks for air and pavement temperature and pressure leverage work performed for the WxDE specifically for spatial quality checks. Observations are compared to the same observation type from nearby platforms. Nearby platforms are currently defined as being within a 69-mile radius and 5-minute observation time from the data point being quality checked. Where there are more than 5 observations within a 69-mile radius and 5-minute observation time, the IQR is used as a more robust method for spatial quality check. In the instance where there are fewer observations than required for an IQR, the Barnes Spatial quality check is used instead. If the observation type is for atmospheric pressure, the observation is adjusted for sea level for comparison.\nQuality checking results are interpreted from the output as follows:\n\"P\" - The observation passed the quality check.\n\"N\" - The observation did not pass the quality check.\n\"-\" - The quality check was not run for the observation, usually due to insufficient background field data.\n\"/\" - The quality check was not configured to run for the observation type.\n", "This field contains the flag for a quality check for each data record. The SourceId field determines which quality check is depicted in this field. \nFor SourceId = 1, this field depicts the Sea Level Pressure Test. This test is an application of the Barnes Spatial Test to sea level pressure estimates computed by correcting barometric pressure measurements for elevation and relies on daily RADIOSONDE pressure reports as reference.\nFor SourceId = 2, this field depicts the Time-step which verifies that the change between an observation and previous observations from the same sensor is less than the maximum rate of change allowed for the sensor hardware that produced the observations.\nQuality checking results are interpreted from the output as follows:\n\"-\" - The quality check was not run for the observation, usually due to insufficient background field data.\n\"/\" - The quality check was not configured to run for the observation type.\n", "This field contains the flag for a quality check for each data record.

For each Path History point, the lat-long offset units support units of 1/10th micro degrees of lat and long. The elevation offset units are in 10cm units. The time is expressed in units of 10 milliseconds. The PositionalAccuracy entry uses 3 elements to relate the pseudorange noise measured in the system.

This table only lists airport markets where the origin or destination airport is an airport that has other commercial airports in the same city. Midway Airport (MDW) and O'Hare (ORD) are examples of this.  All records are aggregated as directionless markets.  The combination of Airport_1 and Airport_2 define the airport pair market.  All traffic traveling in both directions is added together.\n\nhttps://www.transportation.gov/policy/aviation-policy/competition-data-analysis/research-reports", "attribution": "Department of Transportation Office of the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs", "attribution_link": "https://www.transportation.gov/policy/aviation-policy/competition-data-analysis/research-reports", "contact_email": "Randall.Keizer@dot.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-10-16T16:25:43.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-04-03T18:47:04.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-10-16T16:25:40.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-10-16T16:25:43.000Z", "columns_name": ["carrier_low", "Geocoded_City2", "quarter", "nsmiles", "Geocoded_City1 (address)", "citymarketid_2", "airportid_1", "fare", "Year", "citymarketid_1", "city2", "airportid_2", "airport_1", "airport_2", "carrier_lg", "fare_low", "Geocoded_City1", "Geocoded_City1 (state)", "Geocoded_City2 (city)", "city1", "passengers", "large_ms", "lf_ms", "fare_lg", "Geocoded_City1 (city)", "Geocoded_City2 (address)", "tbl1apk", "tbl", "Geocoded_City1 (zip)", "Geocoded_City2 (zip)", "Geocoded_City2 (state)"], "columns_field_name": ["carrier_low", "location_2", "quarter", "nsmiles", "location_1_address", "citymarketid_2", "airportid_1", "fare", "year", "citymarketid_1", "city2", "airportid_2", "airport_1", "airport_2", "carrier_lg", "fare_low", "location_1", "location_1_state", "location_2_city", "city1", "passengers", "large_ms", "lf_ms", "fare_lg", "location_1_city", "location_2_address", "tbl1apk", "tbl", "location_1_zip", "location_2_zip", "location_2_state"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Point", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Point", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Carrier with the lowest fare", "Geocoded - City2 is used to consolidate airports serving the same city market with Latitude and Longitude", "Quarter", "Non-Stop market miles (using radian measure)", "", "City market ID is an identification number assigned by US DOT\nto identify a city market.

The Federal Highway Administration\u2019s Turner Fairbank Highway Research Center (TFHRC), in conjunction with the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center,  tested and evaluated this prototype system in 2016. Researchers in the Saxton Transportation Operations Laboratory at TFHRC designed and built the Cooperative Automated Research Mobility Applications (CARMA) platform version 1 that enables the implementation of the proof-of-concept CACC-based platooning in passenger vehicles equipped with production adaptive cruise control, and vehicle-to-vehicle communications using dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). The data characterize the state-of-the-art capability of the CACC application based on engineering tests that were performed on closed tracks by professional drivers and using prescribed test procedures. The test data are separated into sets that correspond to test date and time, and test run number. The data include performance parameters that were collected from the CACC application and data acquisition systems, including vehicle controller area network data, CARMA's MicroAutoBox, DSRC radios, and an independent measurement system. The tests were conducted at US Army\u2019s Aberdeen Test Center located at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD.
