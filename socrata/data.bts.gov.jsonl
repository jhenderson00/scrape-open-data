The index, which is seasonally adjusted, combines available data on freight traffic, as well as passenger travel, that have been weighted to yield a monthly measure of transportation services output.\n\nFor charts and discussion on the relationship of the TSI to the economy, see our Transportation as an Economic Indicator: Transportation Services Index page  (https://data.bts.gov/stories/s/TET-indicator-1/9czv-tjte)\n\nFor release schedule see: https://www.bts.gov/newsroom/transportation-services-index-release-schedule\n\nAbout seasonally-adjusted data\n\nStatisticians use the process of seasonal-adjustment to uncover trends in data. Monthly data, for instance, are influenced by the number of days and the number of weekends in a month as well as by the timing of holidays and seasonal activity. These influences make it difficult to see underlying changes in the data. Statisticians use seasonal adjustment to control for these influences.\n\nControlling of seasonal influences allows measurement of real monthly changes; short and long term patterns of growth or decline; and turning points. Data for one month can be compared to data for any other month in the series and the data series can be ranked to find high and low points. Any observed differences are \u201creal\u201d differences; that is, they are differences brought about by changes in the data and not brought about by a change in the number of days or weekends in the month, the occurrence or non-occurrence of a holiday, or seasonal activity.", "attribution": "U.S. DOT Bureau of Transportation Statistics", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "theresa.firestine@dot.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-07-14T15:00:10.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-03-21T14:11:48.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-07-14T15:00:07.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-07-14T15:00:10.000Z", "columns_name": ["IDX_WATERBORNE_D11", "IDX_RAIL_PM", "IDX_RAIL_FRT_INTERMODAL", "RAIL_PM_D11", "MANUF", "LOAD_FACTOR_I", "ENPLANE_D", "ENPLANE_D_D11", "NATURAL_GAS", "TSI_Freight_C", "TSI_Passenger_C", "IND_PRO", "AIR_RTMFM_D11", "WATERBORNE", "ENPLANE_D11", "TSI_Total", "ASM_D_D11", "ASM_I", "RPM", "RPM_D11", "RPM_D", "RPM_D_D11", "LOAD_FACTOR", "LOAD_FACTOR_I_D11", "ENPLANE_I", "ENPLANE", "AIR_RPM_TSI", "AIR_RPM_TSI_D11", "AIR_RTMFM", "RAIL_FRT_CARLOADS_D11", "RAIL_FRT_INTERMODAL", "RAIL_PM", "TRANSIT", "TRANSIT_D11", "PETROLEUM_D11", "VMT", "VMT_D11", "TSI_Freight", "TSI_Total_C", "IDX_AIR_RPM", "IDX_AIR_RTMFM", "IDX_RAIL_FRT_CARLOADS", "IDX_TRANSIT_D11", "IDX_PETROLEUM_D11", "IDX_NATURAL_GAS_D11", "ID", "ASM_D11", "ASM_I_D11", "RPM_I", "LOAD_FACTOR_D11", "LOAD_FACTOR_D", "RAIL_FRT_INTERMODAL_D11", "PETROLEUM", "NATURAL_GAS_D11", "WATERBORNE_D11", "TRUCK_D11", "INV_TO_SALES", "IDX_TRUCK_D11", "OBS_DATE", "ASM_D", "RAIL_FRT_CARLOADS", "TSI_Passenger", "RPM_I_D11", "LOAD_FACTOR_D_D11", "ASM", "ENPLANE_I_D11"], "columns_field_name": ["idx_waterborne_d11", "idx_rail_pm", "idx_rail_frt_intermodal", "rail_pm_d11", "manuf", "load_factor_i", "enplane_d", "enplane_d_d11", "natural_gas", "tsi_freight_c", "tsi_passenger_c", "ind_pro", "air_rtmfm_d11", "waterborne", "enplane_d11", "tsi_total", "asm_d_d11", "asm_i", "rpm", "rpm_d11", "rpm_d", "rpm_d_d11", "load_factor", "load_factor_i_d11", "enplane_i", "enplane", "air_rpm_tsi", "air_rpm_tsi_d11", "air_rtmfm", "rail_frt_carloads_d11", "rail_frt_intermodal", "rail_pm", "transit", "transit_d11", "petroleum_d11", "vmt", "vmt_d11", "tsi_freight", "tsi_total_c", "idx_air_rpm", "idx_air_rtmfm", "idx_rail_frt_carloads", "idx_transit_d11", "idx_petroleum_d11", "idx_natural_gas_d11", "id", "asm_d11", "asm_i_d11", "rpm_i", "load_factor_d11", "load_factor_d", "rail_frt_intermodal_d11", "petroleum", "natural_gas_d11", "waterborne_d11", "truck_d11", "inv_to_sales", "idx_truck_d11", "obs_date", "asm_d", "rail_frt_carloads", "tsi_passenger", "rpm_i_d11", "load_factor_d_d11", "asm", "enplane_i_d11"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "Seasonally-Adjusted Rail Passenger Miles", "", "Load Factor for U.S. Air Carrier International, Scheduled Passenger Flights (Percent)", "Enplanements for U.S. Air Carrier Domestic, Scheduled Passenger Flights (Thousands)", "Seasonally-Adjusted Enplanements for U.S. Air Carrier Domestic, Scheduled Passenger Flights (Thousands)", "Natural Gas Consumption (Billion Cubic Feet)", "The monthly change in value of  the Transportation Services Freight Index.

{"resource": {"name": "Trips by Distance", "id": "w96p-f2qv", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Trip data for the first five months of 2023 are currently being back-filled. New data will be added as they are received, with all associated dashboards updating at 10am Eastern Time on the day after any new have been uploaded to this platform. Next-week updates for 2023 will resume once all remaining 2023 data have been backfilled. We apologize for the inconvenience caused by this disruption. \n\nHow many people are staying at home? How far are people traveling when they don\u2019t stay home? Which states and counties have more people taking trips? The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) now provides answers to those questions through our new mobility statistics.\n\nThe Trips by Distance data and number of people staying home and not staying home are estimated for the Bureau of Transportation Statistics by the Maryland Transportation Institute and Center for Advanced Transportation Technology Laboratory at the University of Maryland. The travel statistics are produced from an anonymized national panel of mobile device data from multiple sources. All data sources used in the creation of the metrics contain no personal information. Data analysis is conducted at the aggregate national, state, and county levels. A weighting procedure expands the sample of millions of mobile devices, so the results are representative of the entire population in a nation, state, or county. To assure confidentiality and support data quality, no data are reported for a county if it has fewer than 50 devices in the sample on any given day.\n\nTrips are defined as movements that include a stay of longer than 10 minutes at an anonymized location away from home. Home locations are imputed on a weekly basis. A movement with multiple stays of longer than 10 minutes before returning home is counted as multiple trips. Trips capture travel by all modes of transportation. including driving, rail, transit, and air.\n\nThe daily travel estimates are from a mobile device data panel from merged multiple data sources that address the geographic and temporal sample variation issues often observed in a single data source. The merged data panel only includes mobile devices whose anonymized location data meet a set of data quality standards, which further ensures the overall data quality and consistency. The data quality standards consider both temporal frequency and spatial accuracy of anonymized location point observations, temporal coverage and representativeness at the device level, spatial representativeness at the sample and county level, etc. A multi-level weighting method that employs both device and trip-level weights expands the sample to the underlying population at the county and state levels, before travel statistics are computed.\n\nThese data are experimental and may not meet all of our quality standards.  Experimental data products are created using new data sources or methodologies that benefit data users in the absence of other relevant products. We are seeking feedback from data users and stakeholders on the quality and usefulness of these new products. Experimental data products that meet our quality standards and demonstrate sufficient user demand may enter regular production if resources permit.", "attribution": "Maryland Transportation Institute

{"resource": {"name": "Trips by Distance", "id": "w96p-f2qv", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Trip data for the first five months of 2023 are currently being back-filled. New data will be added as they are received, with all associated dashboards updating at 10am Eastern Time on the day after any new have been uploaded to this platform. Next-week updates for 2023 will resume once all remaining 2023 data have been backfilled. We apologize for the inconvenience caused by this disruption. \n\nHow many people are staying at home? How far are people traveling when they don\u2019t stay home? Which states and counties have more people taking trips? The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) now provides answers to those questions through our new mobility statistics.\n\nThe Trips by Distance data and number of people staying home and not staying home are estimated for the Bureau of Transportation Statistics by the Maryland Transportation Institute and Center for Advanced Transportation Technology Laboratory at the University of Maryland. The travel statistics are produced from an anonymized national panel of mobile device data from multiple sources. All data sources used in the creation of the metrics contain no personal information. Data analysis is conducted at the aggregate national, state, and county levels. A weighting procedure expands the sample of millions of mobile devices, so the results are representative of the entire population in a nation, state, or county. To assure confidentiality and support data quality, no data are reported for a county if it has fewer than 50 devices in the sample on any given day.\n\nTrips are defined as movements that include a stay of longer than 10 minutes at an anonymized location away from home. Home locations are imputed on a weekly basis. A movement with multiple stays of longer than 10 minutes before returning home is counted as multiple trips. Trips capture travel by all modes of transportation. including driving, rail, transit, and air.\n\nThe daily travel estimates are from a mobile device data panel from merged multiple data sources that address the geographic and temporal sample variation issues often observed in a single data source. The merged data panel only includes mobile devices whose anonymized location data meet a set of data quality standards, which further ensures the overall data quality and consistency. The data quality standards consider both temporal frequency and spatial accuracy of anonymized location point observations, temporal coverage and representativeness at the device level, spatial representativeness at the sample and county level, etc. A multi-level weighting method that employs both device and trip-level weights expands the sample to the underlying population at the county and state levels, before travel statistics are computed.\n\nThese data are experimental and may not meet all of our quality standards.  Experimental data products are created using new data sources or methodologies that benefit data users in the absence of other relevant products. We are seeking feedback from data users and stakeholders on the quality and usefulness of these new products. Experimental data products that meet our quality standards and demonstrate sufficient user demand may enter regular production if resources permit.", "attribution": "Maryland Transportation Institute
