For more information, please visit www.energystar.gov/mostefficient", "Some dehumidifiers can operate in an alternate configuration (e.g., a whole-home can operate as a portable) depending on how it is installed. This column indicates the  water removal capacity of the dehumidifier in the configuration opposite of that listed under \"Dehumidifier Type\". If nothing is listed, the dehumidifier cannot operate in an alternate configuration.", "An identifier assigned by the manufacturer or private labeler to a product or family/series of products for sales and marketing purposes.", "Some dehumidifiers can operate in both the portable and whole-home configurations by means of a ducting kit. For a dehumidifier sold as a whole-home type that can also operate as a portable type, the portable configuration is listed here as the alternate, and vice versa.

The model number may include a wildcard that can be replaced by any letter or digit and still accurately capture what is covered by the model\u2019s ENERGY STAR certification; an asterisk symbol (*) represents a letter, and a number symbol (#) a digit.", "The date that the model is available for purchase.", "Portable dehumidifiers operate within the dehumidified space without the attachment of additional ducting. Whole-home dehumidifiers are installed with ducting to deliver return process air to the inlet and to supply dehumidified process air from the outlet to one or more locations in the dehumidified space. Some dehumidifiers can operate in both configurations by means of a ducting kit.", "Some dehumidifiers can operate in an alternate configuration (e.g., a whole-home can operate as a portable) depending on how it is installed.

This ESUID is unique to both the model and product specification version and is assigned by EPA upon receipt of certification information from the certification body.
