The CEF metric has units lbs/kWh and is calculated by dividing the weight of the test load by the sum of the per cycle standby and off mode energy consumption and either the total per-cycle electricity dryer energy consumption or the total per-cycle gas dryer energy consumption expressed in kilowatt hours (kWh).
