NOTE: For gas dryers the estimated annual energy use is expressed in kilowatt hours to allow for comparison, and represents the equivalent multi-source energy use of the product (e.g., natural gas or propane typically expressed in British thermal units (Btu)).\n", "CEF is the energy performance metric for ENERGY STAR clothes dryers; the higher the CEF the more efficient the clothes dryer. The metric has units lbs/kWh and is calculated by dividing the weight of the test load by the sum of the per cycle standby and off mode energy consumption and either the total per-cycle electricity dryer energy consumption or the total per-cycle gas dryer energy consumption expressed in kilowatt hours (kWh).\n", "The estimated energy test cycle time is the time taken to complete the test cycle necessary for ENERGY STAR certification. Products must complete the energy test cycle in less than 80 minutes in order to be certified as ENERGY STAR. The estimated test cycle time does not reflect actual consumer cycle times which vary as a result of load size, dampness, and composition.\n", "Paired clothes washer ENERGY STAR Model Identifier .\n", "The date that the model is available for purchase.\n", "A unique string of characters assigned by certification bodies (CBs) to identify a model or set of models with the same performance characteristics. This identifier should remain the same for a model even if it is recertified to a new version of an ENERGY STAR specification. This string of characters is determined by CBs and is not the ENERGY STAR Unique ID assigned by EPA.", "", "UPC codes provided by partners for ENERGY STAR certified products. The brand, model name and model number continue to serve as the identifiers used to establish certification. The UPC code data below is intended to aid in identification of ENERGY STAR models.

Heat pump dryers require refrigerants as well. Many refrigerants are harmful atmospheric pollutants that have a high global warming potential (GWP). Lower GWP alternative refrigerant options for clothes dryers include R-290.", "Venting Configuration refers to how the clothes dryer exhausts heated air. Vented clothes dryers exhaust the evaporated moisture from the clothes dryer cabinet using a vent which typically leads to a building\u2019s exterior. Ventless clothes dryers use a closed loop system with an internal condenser to remove the evaporated moisture from the heated air. Moisture is discharged from the cabinet and instead collected in a reservoir or drained through a tube.", "A distinguishing, alphanumeric identifier, assigned to a product by the manufacturer or private labeler.
