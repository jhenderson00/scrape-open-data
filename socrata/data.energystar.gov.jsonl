The metric has units lbs/kWh and is calculated by dividing the weight of the test load by the sum of the per cycle standby and off mode energy consumption and either the total per-cycle electricity dryer energy consumption or the total per-cycle gas dryer energy consumption expressed in kilowatt hours (kWh).\n", "The estimated annual energy use is based on the Combined Energy Factor and an annual usage of 283 cycles per year, as referenced by the U.S. Department of Energy test procedure, Code of Federal Regulations, Title 10, Section 430, Subpart B, Appendix D2. Actual energy consumption will vary on your usage patterns, including how often your run the dryer, what cycle you select, and load size. NOTE: For gas dryers the estimated annual energy use is expressed in kilowatt hours to allow for comparison, and represents the equivalent multi-source energy use of the product (e.g., natural gas or propane typically expressed in British thermal units (Btu)).\n", "The estimated energy test cycle time is the time taken to complete the test cycle necessary for ENERGY STAR certification. Products must complete the energy test cycle in less than 80 minutes in order to be certified as ENERGY STAR. The estimated test cycle time does not reflect actual consumer cycle times which vary as a result of load size, dampness, and composition.\n", "The date that the model is available for purchase.\n", "A unique string of characters assigned by certification bodies (CBs) to identify a model or set of models with the same performance characteristics. This identifier should remain the same for a model even if it is recertified to a new version of an ENERGY STAR specification. This string of characters is determined by CBs and is not the ENERGY STAR Unique ID assigned by EPA.", "", "Open Standard - Application Layer include SEP 1.x, SEP2.x, OpenADR, etc.", "The ENERGY STAR Unique ID (ESUID) is a string of seven numbers EPA assigns to an ENERGY STAR model or set of models with unique performance characteristics. This ESUID is unique to both the model and product specification version and is assigned by EPA upon receipt of certification information from the certification body. Each row within the product list will have a unique ESUID.
