Actual energy consumption will vary on your usage patterns, including how often your run the dryer, what cycle you select, and load size. NOTE: For gas dryers the estimated annual energy use is expressed in kilowatt hours to allow for comparison, and represents the equivalent multi-source energy use of the product (e.g., natural gas or propane typically expressed in British thermal units (Btu)).\n", "UPC codes provided by partners for ENERGY STAR certified products.
