NOTE: For gas dryers the estimated annual energy use is expressed in kilowatt hours to allow for comparison, and represents the equivalent multi-source energy use of the product (e.g., natural gas or propane typically expressed in British thermal units (Btu)).\n", "The Calculated CEF \u2013 Max Dry is a measure of the dryer\u2019s energy performance in a more energy consumptive setting, namely the normal cycle with the highest dryness setting as defined in the ENERGY STAR Most Efficient 2017 criteria. The Calculated CEF \u2013 Max Dry should not be directly compared to the CEF field, which is tested using the medium dryness setting, and represents a rated rather than measured value. The CEF metric has units lbs/kWh and is calculated by dividing the weight of the test load by the sum of the per cycle standby and off mode energy consumption and either the total per-cycle electricity dryer energy consumption or the total per-cycle gas dryer energy consumption expressed in kilowatt hours (kWh).
