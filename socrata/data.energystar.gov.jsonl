For more information, please visit www.energystar.gov/mostefficient", "The ENERGY STAR Unique ID (ESUID) is a string of seven numbers EPA assigns to an ENERGY STAR model or set of models with unique performance characteristics. This ESUID is unique to both the model and product specification version and is assigned by EPA upon receipt of certification information from the certification body. Each row within the product list will have a unique ESUID. Developers may wish to use this ESUID to track information on certified models in their information systems.", "", "The estimated energy test cycle time is the time taken to complete the test cycle necessary for ENERGY STAR certification. Products must complete the energy test cycle in less than 80 minutes in order to be certified as ENERGY STAR. The estimated test cycle time does not reflect actual consumer cycle times which vary as a result of load size, dampness, and composition.\n", "CEF is the energy performance metric for ENERGY STAR clothes dryers; the higher the CEF the more efficient the clothes dryer.
