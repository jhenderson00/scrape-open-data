A variable refrigerant flow multi-split (VRF) model consists of a unit of commercial package air-conditioning and heating equipment that is configured as a split system incorporating a single refrigerant circuit, with one or more outdoor units, at least one variable-speed compressor or an alternate compressor combination for varying the capacity of the system by three or more steps, and multiple indoor fan coil units, each of which is individually metered and individually controlled by an integral control device and common communications network and which can operate independently in response to multiple indoor thermostats.

Small-scale Servers are designed to perform functions such as providing network infrastructure services (e.g., archiving) and hosting data/media.\n\nThin Client: An independently-powered computer that relies on a connection to remote computing resources to obtain primary functionality. Main computing functions (e.g., program execution, data storage, interaction with other Internet resources) are provided by the remote computing resources.\n\nWorkstation: A high-performance, single-user computer typically used for graphics, CAD, software development, financial and scientific applications among other compute intensive tasks.", "The number of Thunderbolt 3 ports in the product.
