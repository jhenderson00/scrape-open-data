Products with a drum capacity less than 4.4 cubic feet are considered compact.\n", "The cycle selection and settings (temperature and dryness where separately selectable) as defined in the U.S. Department of Energy test procedure, Code of Federal Regulations, Title 10, Section 430, Subpart B, Appendix D2, Section 3.3, used for certification to ENERGY STAR.", "The ENERGY STAR Unique ID (ESUID) is a string of seven numbers EPA assigns to an ENERGY STAR model or set of models with unique performance characteristics. This ESUID is unique to both the model and product specification version and is assigned by EPA upon receipt of certification information from the certification body. Each row within the product list will have a unique ESUID. Developers may wish to use this ESUID to track information on certified models in their information systems.", "Features applicable to the clothes dryer may include drum light, wrinkle prevention option, steam cycle, sanitization cycle, filter cleaning indicator, energy monitor/indicator, time remaining display, and supplementary drying system.", "A distinguishing, alphanumeric identifier, assigned to a product by the manufacturer or private labeler. The model number may include a wildcard that can be replaced by any letter or digit and still accurately capture what is covered by the model\u2019s ENERGY STAR certification; an asterisk symbol (*) represents a letter, and a number symbol (#) a digit.", "UPC codes provided by partners for ENERGY STAR certified products. The brand, model name and model number continue to serve as the identifiers used to establish certification. The UPC code data below is intended to aid in identification of ENERGY STAR models. UPC code data is not provided for all certified models.", "The height of the clothes dryer.", "The depth of the clothes dryer.", "CEF is the energy performance metric for ENERGY STAR clothes dryers; the higher the CEF the more efficient the clothes dryer. The metric has units lbs/kWh and is calculated by dividing the weight of the test load by the sum of the per cycle standby and off mode energy consumption and either the total per-cycle electricity dryer energy consumption or the total per-cycle gas dryer energy consumption expressed in kilowatt hours (kWh).\n", "The date that the model is available for purchase.\n", "The estimated energy test cycle time is the time taken to complete the test cycle necessary for ENERGY STAR certification. Products must complete the energy test cycle in less than 80 minutes in order to be certified as ENERGY STAR. The estimated test cycle time does not reflect actual consumer cycle times which vary as a result of load size, dampness, and composition.\n", "A unique string of characters assigned by certification bodies (CBs) to identify a model or set of models with the same performance characteristics. This identifier should remain the same for a model even if it is recertified to a new version of an ENERGY STAR specification.
