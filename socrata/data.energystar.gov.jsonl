Small-scale Servers are designed to perform functions such as providing network infrastructure services (e.g., archiving) and hosting data/media.\n\nThin Client: An independently-powered computer that relies on a connection to remote computing resources to obtain primary functionality. Main computing functions (e.g., program execution, data storage, interaction with other Internet resources) are provided by the remote computing resources.\n\nWorkstation: A high-performance, single-user computer typically used for graphics, CAD, software development, financial and scientific applications among other compute intensive tasks.", "The minimum processing speed of the central processing unit (CPU).", "The power state in which the operating system and other software have completed loading, a user profile has been created, activity is limited to those basic applications that the system starts by default, and the computer is not in Sleep Mode.
