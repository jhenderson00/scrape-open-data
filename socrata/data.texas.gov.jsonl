Traditional summer meal program service  resumed at the end of the school year through September 2021 or until the start of the 2021-2022 school year, whichever was sooner.  <p>  \n\nFor more information on the waivers implemented for this purpose, please visit our website at <a href=http://www.SquareMeals.org target=\"\"_blank\"\">SquareMeals.org</a>. <p>\n\n<b>This dataset contains sponsor-level claimed meal reimbursements. </b>Meal count data is collected at the site level and is reported in the \u201cSummer Meal Programs \u2013 Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) \u2013 Meal Count Information\u201d dataset for the program year. <p> \n\n\nFor data on sites participating in the Seamless Summer Option (SSO), please refer to the Summer Meal Programs \u2013 Seamless Summer Option \u2013 Meal Counts and Meal Reimbursement datasets available on the State of Texas Open Data Portal. \n<p>\n\nAn overview of <b>all Summer Meal Program data available</b> on the Texas Open Data Portal can be found at our <b><u><a href=https://data.texas.gov/stories/s/52en-tt82 target=\"\"_blank\"\">TDA Data Overview - Summer Meals Programs</a></b> </u>page.<p>\n\nAn overview of <b>all TDA Food and Nutrition data available</b> on the Texas Open Data Portal can be found at our <b><u><a href=https://data.texas.gov/stories/s/TDA-Data-Overview-Food-and-Nutrition-Programs-Open/nk79-w2cs/ target=\"\"_blank\"\">TDA Data Overview - Food and Nutrition Open Data</a></b></u> page. <p>\n\n<b>About Dataset Updates</b><br>\n\nTDA aims to post new program year data by July 15 of the active program period. <b>Participants have 60 days to file monthly claims.</b> Dataset updates will occur monthly until 90 days after the close of the program period.

Both require CPI to assess safety and take needed actions to protect a child and assess the risk of future abuse or neglect in the foreseeable future.  AR, however, allows for a more flexible, family engaging approach on lower priority cases involving alleged victims who are age 6 or older.    AR differs from traditional investigations in that there is no substantiation of allegations, no entry of perpetrators into the Central Registry (a repository for reports of child abuse and neglect), and there a heightened focus on guiding the family to plan for safety in a way that works for them and therefore sustains the safety.\n\nCompleted investigations only include those cases conducted as a traditional investigation that were not administratively closed or merged into another stage. An investigation can only be administratively closed if all allegations have a disposition of administrative closure. A completed investigation can include more than one alleged victim. Completed investigations do not include any Alternative Response cases. A description of Alternative Response and how it differs from a traditional investigation is in the CPS glossary. \n\nAt the end of a completed investigation, CPI assesses child safety, the risk of abuse or neglect in the foreseeable future, the ability of the family to reduce the risk without CPI intervention, the ability of CPI to provide needed services and other circumstances in the case to decide whether to provide ongoing services. \n\nThe Case Action Substitute Care includes investigations that resulted in at least one child (not necessarily all children in the home) being removed.

Both require CPI to assess safety and take needed actions to protect a child and assess the risk of future abuse or neglect in the foreseeable future.  AR, however, allows for a more flexible, family engaging approach on lower priority cases involving alleged victims who are age 6 or older.    AR differs from traditional investigations in that there is no substantiation of allegations, no entry of perpetrators into the Central Registry (a repository for reports of child abuse and neglect), and there a heightened focus on guiding the family to plan for safety in a way that works for them and therefore sustains the safety.\n\nCompleted investigations only include those cases conducted as a traditional investigation that were not administratively closed or merged into another stage. An investigation can only be administratively closed if all allegations have a disposition of administrative closure. A completed investigation can include more than one alleged victim. Completed investigations do not include any Alternative Response cases. A description of Alternative Response and how it differs from a traditional investigation is in the CPS glossary. \n\nAt the end of a completed investigation, CPI assesses child safety, the risk of abuse or neglect in the foreseeable future, the ability of the family to reduce the risk without CPI intervention, the ability of CPI to provide needed services and other circumstances in the case to decide whether to provide ongoing services. \n\nThe Case Action Substitute Care includes investigations that resulted in at least one child (not necessarily all children in the home) being removed.

CPI must initiate the investigation within 24 hours of receiving a Priority I report. \n\nPriority II - All reports of abuse or neglect that are not assigned as Priority I are assigned as Priority II. These are reports that contain allegations of abuse or neglect in which there does not appear to be an immediate threat of serious harm or death. A subset of these reports are sent down the Alternative Response (AR)* pathway.  Those reports not sent to AR continue as a traditional investigation.

Child Care Investigations (CCI), which is a part of CPI and includes Day Care Investigations (DCI) and Residential Child Care Investigations (RCCI), conduct investigations of abuse and neglect.

Traditional investigations and Alternative Response require caseworkers to assess safety and take needed actions to protect a child while assessing any risk of abuse or neglect in the foreseeable future. AR cases present a less adversarial more collaborative approach to working with families by allowing for family engagement along with other community supports to ensure child safety. AR differs from traditional investigations in that AR cases are Priority 2 cases involving victims who are age 6 or older, there is no substantiation of allegations, no entry of perpetrators into the Central Registry (a repository for reports of child abuse and neglect), and there is a heightened focus on guiding the family to plan for safety in a way that works for them and therefore sustains safety. \n\nAlterative Response has been fully implemented in Regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. AR in Region 6A is in the implementation stage. Full state implementation is anticipated in March 2021.  Region 6A is Harris County and Region 6B is Region 6 excluding Harris County. \n\nThe persons in these counts are limited to principals in Alternative Response stages. Clients in stages that were administratively closed or closed to merge were excluded from the counts.\n\nThis dashboard addresses Texas Family Code Section 264.017 (b) (3).", "attribution": "DFPS Data and Decision Support", "attribution_link": "https://www.dfps.texas.gov/About_DFPS/Data_Book/Child_Protective_Investigations/Alternative_Response/AR_children_families_served.asp", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-01-30T20:27:41.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-04-21T19:48:35.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-01-30T20:27:40.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-01-30T20:27:41.000Z", "columns_name": ["Fiscal Year", "Client Type", "# of Clients in Alternaive Response Stages Closed during Fiscal Year", "County", "Alternative Response Outcome", "Region"], "columns_field_name": ["fiscal_year", "client_type", "clients", "county", "outcome", "region"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-04-21T19:55:40.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["public safety"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["ado", "adoption", "child abuse/neglect", "child protective investigations", "cpi", "cps", "databook", "data book", "dfps", "investigations", "oidb", "rcci", "residential child care", "topic"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Microsite_Tags", "value": "Social Services"}, {"key": "Dataset-Category_Agency", "value": "Texas Department of Family and Protective Services"}, {"key": "Dataset-Category_Category-Tile", "value": "Social Services"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.texas.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.texas.gov/d/f3qi-ik8u", "link": "https://data.texas.gov/dataset/CPI-5-3-Alternative-Response-Stages-Clients-Served/f3qi-ik8u", "owner": {"id": "kq9x-xmzg", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "TX DFPS Data Decision and Support - Interactive Data Book"}, "creator": {"id": "kq9x-xmzg", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "TX DFPS Data Decision and Support - Interactive Data Book"}}

Traditional investigations and Alternative Response require caseworkers to assess safety and take needed actions to protect a child while assessing any risk of abuse or neglect in the foreseeable future. AR cases present a less adversarial more collaborative approach to working with families by allowing for family engagement along with other community supports to ensure child safety. AR differs from traditional investigations in that AR cases are Priority 2 cases involving victims who are age 6 or older,  there is no substantiation of allegations, no entry of perpetrators into the Central Registry (a repository for reports of child abuse and neglect), and there is a heightened focus on guiding the family to plan for safety in a way that works for them.\n\nCompleted investigations only include those cases conducted as a traditional investigation that were not administratively closed or merged into another stage. An investigation can only be administratively closed if all allegations have a disposition of administrative closure. A completed investigation can include more than one alleged victim. Completed investigations do not include any Alternative Response cases.   \n\nAn investigation represents a report of abuse or neglect and can involve multiple children.\n\nThe data on completed investigations does not include investigative stages that were administratively closed or merged into another investigation. \n\nAll completed investigations have a case disposition and a risk finding. \n\nMore information at www.dfps.texas.gov", "attribution": "TX DFPS Data and Decision Support", "attribution_link": "https://www.dfps.texas.gov/About_DFPS/Data_Book/Child_Protective_Investigations/Intakes.asp", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-01-30T17:54:15.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-03-18T20:34:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-01-30T17:54:13.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-01-30T17:54:15.000Z", "columns_name": ["Region", "Region Code", "Fiscal Year", "Completed Investigations"], "columns_field_name": ["region", "region_code", "fiscal_year", "completed_investigations"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2021-03-18T20:41:13.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["public safety", "infrastructure", "finance"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["abuse neglect investigations", "child protective investigations", "cpi", "cps", "databook", "data book", "dps", "inv", "investigations", "oidb"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Dataset-Category_Agency", "value": "Texas Department of Family and Protective Services"}, {"key": "Dataset-Category_Category-Tile", "value": "Social Services"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.texas.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.texas.gov/d/gku3-vdgs", "link": "https://data.texas.gov/dataset/CPI-3-1-Completed-Abuse-Neglect-Investigations-by-/gku3-vdgs", "owner": {"id": "kq9x-xmzg", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "TX DFPS Data Decision and Support - Interactive Data Book"}, "creator": {"id": "kq9x-xmzg", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "TX DFPS Data Decision and Support - Interactive Data Book"}}

This order is only available when family violence has been committed by a family member, member of the household, or in some circumstances by a person the victim has dated.\n\nEach victim may have more than one perpetrator in an investigation.\n\nVisit dfps.state.tx.us for information on all DFPS programs.", "attribution": "DFPS Data and Decision Support", "attribution_link": "https://www.dfps.texas.gov/About_DFPS/Data_Book/Adult_Protective_Services/Investigations/Perpetrators.asp", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-02-07T22:00:04.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-09-04T20:32:15.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-02-07T22:00:02.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-07T22:00:04.000Z", "columns_name": ["Fiscal Year", "Region", "Relationship to Victim", "Confirmed Perpetrators", "Perpetrators"], "columns_field_name": ["fiscal_year", "region", "relationship_to_victim", "confirmed_perpetrators", "perpetrators"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-09-04T20:33:37.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["finance"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["abuse neglect investigations", "adult protection", "adult protective services", "alleged", "aps", "aps investigations", "databook", "data book", "dfps", "investigations", "oidb"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Microsite_Tags", "value": "Social Services"}, {"key": "Microsite_Microsite", "value": "Texas Department of Family and Protective Service"}, {"key": "Dataset-Category_Agency", "value": "Texas Department of Family and Protective Services"}, {"key": "Dataset-Category_Category-Tile", "value": "Social Services"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.texas.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.texas.gov/d/hvqg-3jgc", "link": "https://data.texas.gov/dataset/APS-3-5-Investigations-Perpetrators-by-Relationshi/hvqg-3jgc", "owner": {"id": "kq9x-xmzg", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "TX DFPS Data Decision and Support - Interactive Data Book"}, "creator": {"id": "kq9x-xmzg", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "TX DFPS Data Decision and Support - Interactive Data Book"}}

AR differs from traditional investigations in that AR cases are Priority 2 cases involving victims who are age 6 or older,  there is no substantiation of allegations, no entry of perpetrators into the Central Registry (a repository for reports of child abuse and neglect), and there is a heightened focus on guiding the family to plan for safety in a way that works for them and therefore sustains safety. \n\nAlterative Response has been fully implemented in Regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11.

Traditional investigations and Alternative Response require caseworkers to assess safety and take needed actions to protect a child while assessing any risk of abuse or neglect in the foreseeable future. AR cases present a less adversarial more collaborative approach to working with families by allowing for family engagement along with other community supports to ensure child safety.  AR differs from traditional investigations in that AR cases are Priority 2 cases involving victims who are age 6 or older,  there is no substantiation of allegations, no entry of perpetrators into the Central Registry (a repository for reports of child abuse and neglect), and there is a heightened focus on guiding the family to plan for safety in a way that works for them and therefore sustains safety. \n\nAlternative response is timely if the first face-to-face meeting with the family and children in the household occurs within five days of an AR stage being opened and will involve working with the family to conduct safety and family assessments.  AR cases can remain open for up to 60 days with a one-time 20-day extension, if appropriate. Should CPI staff identify services to improve general family functioning and overall protective actions within the standard AR case time frame, the caseworker will provide support in linking the family to existing resources within the community. \n\nA description of Alternative Response and how it differs from a traditional investigation and priority response times are in the glossary. \n\nAlterative Response has been fully implemented in Regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11.

This authorization is derived from the U.S. Social Securities Act, Texas Family Code, Human Resources Code, Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, Indian Child Welfare Act and the Adam Walsh Act. \n\nCPI conducts either a traditional investigation or Alternative Response (AR).  Both require CPI to assess safety and take needed actions to protect a child and assess the risk of future abuse or neglect in the foreseeable future.  AR, however, allows for a more flexible, family engaging approach on lower priority cases involving alleged victims who are age 6 or older.    AR differs from traditional investigations in that there is no substantiation of allegations, no entry of perpetrators into the Central Registry (a repository for reports of child abuse and neglect), and there a heightened focus on guiding the family to plan for safety in a way that works for them and therefore sustains the safety. \n\nCompleted investigations only include those cases conducted as a traditional investigation that were not administratively closed or merged into another stage.  An investigation can only be administratively closed if all allegations have a disposition of administrative closure. A completed investigation can include more than one alleged victim.  Completed investigations do not include any Alternative Response cases.   A description of Alternative Response and how it differs from a traditional investigation is in the glossary. \n\nFOOTNOTES\nAn investigation represents a report of abuse or neglect and can involve multiple children.\n \nThe data on completed investigations does not include investigative stages that were administratively closed or merged into another investigation. \n\nAll completed investigations have a case disposition and a risk finding. \n\nVisit dfps.state.tx.us for information on Abuse/Neglect Investigations and all DFPS programs.", "attribution": "TX DFPS Data and Decision Support", "attribution_link": "https://www.dfps.texas.gov/About_DFPS/Data_Book/Child_Protective_Investigations/Investigations/Activity.asp", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-01-30T20:40:05.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-03-16T18:00:36.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-01-30T20:40:05.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-01-30T17:47:17.000Z", "columns_name": ["Fiscal Year", "Region", "County", "Completed Investigations"], "columns_field_name": ["fiscal_year", "region", "county", "completed_investigations"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-03-07T22:01:52.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["public safety", "infrastructure", "finance"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["abuse neglect investigations", "child protective investigations", "cpi", "cps", "databook", "data book", "dfps", "inv", "investigations", "oidb"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Microsite_Tags", "value": "Social Services"}, {"key": "Microsite_Microsite", "value": "Texas Department of Family and Protective Service"}, {"key": "Dataset-Category_Agency", "value": "Texas Department of Family and Protective Services"}, {"key": "Dataset-Category_Category-Tile", "value": "Social Services"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.texas.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.texas.gov/d/waxz-c9q5", "link": "https://data.texas.gov/dataset/CPI-3-1-Completed-Abuse-Neglect-Investigations-by-/waxz-c9q5", "owner": {"id": "kq9x-xmzg", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "TX DFPS Data Decision and Support - Interactive Data Book"}, "creator": {"id": "kq9x-xmzg", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "TX DFPS Data Decision and Support - Interactive Data Book"}}
