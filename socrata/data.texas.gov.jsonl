AR differs from traditional investigations in that AR cases are Priority 2 cases involving victims who are age 6 or older,  there is no substantiation of allegations, no entry of perpetrators into the Central Registry (a repository for reports of child abuse and neglect), and there is a heightened focus on guiding the family to plan for safety in a way that works for them and therefore sustains the safety. \n\nCompleted investigations only include those cases conducted as a traditional investigation that were not administratively closed or merged into another stage.

This authorization is derived from the U.S. Social Securities Act, Texas Family Code, Human Resources Code, Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, Indian Child Welfare Act and the Adam Walsh Act. \n\nCPI conducts either a traditional investigation or Alternative Response (AR).  Both require CPI to assess safety and take needed actions to protect a child and assess the risk of future abuse or neglect in the foreseeable future.  AR, however, allows for a more flexible, family engaging approach on lower priority cases involving alleged victims who are age 6 or older.    AR differs from traditional investigations in that there is no substantiation of allegations, no entry of perpetrators into the Central Registry (a repository for reports of child abuse and neglect), and there a heightened focus on guiding the family to plan for safety in a way that works for them and therefore sustains the safety. \n\nCompleted investigations only include those cases conducted as a traditional investigation that were not administratively closed or merged into another stage.  An investigation can only be administratively closed if all allegations have a disposition of administrative closure. A completed investigation can include more than one alleged victim.  Completed investigations do not include any Alternative Response cases.
