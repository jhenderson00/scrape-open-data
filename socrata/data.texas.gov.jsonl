Traditional investigations and Alternative Response require caseworkers to assess safety and take needed actions to protect a child while assessing any risk of abuse or neglect in the foreseeable future. AR cases present a less adversarial more collaborative approach to working with families by allowing for family engagement along with other community supports to ensure child safety.  AR differs from traditional investigations in that AR cases are Priority 2 cases involving victims who are age 6 or older,  there is no substantiation of allegations, no entry of perpetrators into the Central Registry (a repository for reports of child abuse and neglect), and there is a heightened focus on guiding the family to plan for safety in a way that works for them and therefore sustains safety. \n\nAlterative Response has been fully implemented in Regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11.

{"resource": {"name": "CPI 5.2 Alternative Response Stages - Timeliness of Initial Contact FY2015-2021", "id": "t8e4-4wcj", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "ABOUT THIS CHART\n\nChild Protective Investigations (CPI) conducts either a traditional investigation or Alternative Response (AR). Traditional investigations and Alternative Response require caseworkers to assess safety and take needed actions to protect a child while assessing any risk of abuse or neglect in the foreseeable future. AR cases present a less adversarial more collaborative approach to working with families by allowing for family engagement along with other community supports to ensure child safety.  AR differs from traditional investigations in that AR cases are Priority 2 cases involving victims who are age 6 or older,  there is no substantiation of allegations, no entry of perpetrators into the Central Registry (a repository for reports of child abuse and neglect), and there is a heightened focus on guiding the family to plan for safety in a way that works for them and therefore sustains safety. \n\nAlternative response is timely if the first face-to-face meeting with the family and children in the household occurs within five days of an AR stage being opened and will involve working with the family to conduct safety and family assessments.  AR cases can remain open for up to 60 days with a one-time 20-day extension, if appropriate. Should CPI staff identify services to improve general family functioning and overall protective actions within the standard AR case time frame, the caseworker will provide support in linking the family to existing resources within the community. \n\nA description of Alternative Response and how it differs from a traditional investigation and priority response times are in the glossary. \n\nAlterative Response has been fully implemented in Regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. AR in Region 6A is in the implementation stage. Full state implementation is anticipated in March 2021.

Child Care Investigations (CCI), which is a part of CPI and includes Day Care Investigations (DCI) and Residential Child Care Investigations (RCCI), conduct investigations of abuse and neglect. After the investigation is complete, the investigation is assigned to Child Care Regulation (CCR) with HHSC, where the investigation is assessed for deficiencies of minimum standards. \n\n2.   The number of unregulated operation investigations is calculated using the operations application date that is after the date of the intake. \n\n3.   Exemption requests are submitted to CCR to determine if their operation is subject to regulation. \n\n4.   In Fiscal Year 2011, all Licensed Child Care Centers (LCCCs) were divided into one of the following \u201ccare types\u201d: Before and After School Program (BAP), School-Age Program (SAP), or Child Care Program (CCL). Any LCCCs with \u201cNo Care Type\u201d after Fiscal Year 2010 are operations that were placed on adverse action prior to 09/01/2010, and a new permit was not issued for the specified care type. \n\n5.   Abuse and neglect investigations cannot be closed until they have been reviewed and approved by the appropriate CCI staff. \n\n6.

This authorization is derived from the U.S. Social Securities Act, Texas Family Code, Human Resources Code, Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, Indian Child Welfare Act and the Adam Walsh Act. \n\nCPI conducts either a traditional investigation or Alternative Response (AR).  Both require CPI to assess safety and take needed actions to protect a child and assess the risk of future abuse or neglect in the foreseeable future.  AR, however, allows for a more flexible, family engaging approach on lower priority cases involving alleged victims who are age 6 or older.    AR differs from traditional investigations in that there is no substantiation of allegations, no entry of perpetrators into the Central Registry (a repository for reports of child abuse and neglect), and there a heightened focus on guiding the family to plan for safety in a way that works for them and therefore sustains the safety. \n\nCompleted investigations only include those cases conducted as a traditional investigation that were not administratively closed or merged into another stage.  An investigation can only be administratively closed if all allegations have a disposition of administrative closure. A completed investigation can include more than one alleged victim.  Completed investigations do not include any Alternative Response cases.   A description of Alternative Response and how it differs from a traditional investigation is in the glossary. \n\nFOOTNOTES\nAn investigation represents a report of abuse or neglect and can involve multiple children.\n \nThe data on completed investigations does not include investigative stages that were administratively closed or merged into another investigation. \n\nAll completed investigations have a case disposition and a risk finding. \n\nVisit dfps.state.tx.us for information on Abuse/Neglect Investigations and all DFPS programs.", "attribution": "TX DFPS Data and Decision Support", "attribution_link": "http://www.dfps.state.tx.us/About_DFPS/Data_Book/Child_Protective_Investigations/Investigations/Activity.asp", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-02-08T21:21:32.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-03-16T18:00:36.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-02-08T21:21:32.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-02-04T20:22:54.000Z", "columns_name": ["Completed Investigations", "Region", "Fiscal Year", "County"], "columns_field_name": ["completed_investigations", "region", "fiscal_year", "county"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-03-07T22:01:52.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["public safety", "infrastructure", "finance"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["abuse neglect investigations", "child protective investigations", "cpi", "cps", "databook", "data book", "dfps", "inv", "investigations", "oidb"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Microsite_Tags", "value": "Social Services"}, {"key": "Microsite_Microsite", "value": "Texas Department of Family and Protective Service"}, {"key": "Dataset-Category_Agency", "value": "Texas Department of Family and Protective Services"}, {"key": "Dataset-Category_Category-Tile", "value": "Social Services"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.texas.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.texas.gov/d/waxz-c9q5", "link": "https://data.texas.gov/dataset/CPI-3-1-Completed-Abuse-Neglect-Investigations-by-/waxz-c9q5", "owner": {"id": "kq9x-xmzg", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "TX DFPS Data Decision and Support - Interactive Data Book"}, "creator": {"id": "kq9x-xmzg", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "TX DFPS Data Decision and Support - Interactive Data Book"}}
