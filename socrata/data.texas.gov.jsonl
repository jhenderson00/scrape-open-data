Traditional investigations and Alternative Response require caseworkers to assess safety and take needed actions to protect a child while assessing any risk of abuse or neglect in the foreseeable future. AR cases present a less adversarial more collaborative approach to working with families by allowing for family engagement along with other community supports to ensure child safety. AR differs from traditional investigations in that AR cases are Priority 2 cases involving victims who are age 6 or older, there is no substantiation of allegations, no entry of perpetrators into the Central Registry (a repository for reports of child abuse and neglect), and there is a heightened focus on guiding the family to plan for safety in a way that works for them and therefore sustains safety. \n\nAlterative Response has been fully implemented in Regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. AR in Region 6A is in the implementation stage. Full state implementation is anticipated in March 2021.  Region 6A is Harris County and Region 6B is Region 6 excluding Harris County. \n\nThe persons in these counts are limited to principals in Alternative Response stages.

Almost two decades later, the Legislature offered hotel occupancy taxing authority as one of several revenue options to support sports and community venues. The tax may be levied by a city, county or a partnership between the two.\n\nThroughout the years, the Texas Legislature has passed laws that increased local government transparency while also allowing the public to better understand the state\u2019s patchwork of municipal and county HOTs. During the 88th Legislative Session, House Bill 3727 and Senate Bill 1420 were passed to require municipalities and counties to report the amount and percentage of HOT revenue allocated by the local government.\n\nWhile the Comptroller\u2019s office is not required to post submitted local HOT information on its website, this office nonetheless intends to make available all municipal and county data provided to it during the reporting period. The data will be available shortly after the reporting period closes.\n\nQuestions about the spreadsheet can be sent to the Transparency and Local Government Teams at 844-519-5676 or sent to

Should an entity that has previously submitted a report of eminent domain authority later inform the Comptroller that a change has occurred such that the entity no longer possesses eminent domain authority or is required to submit a report in accordance with \u00a72206.154, that entity will not be placed on the noncompliant entities list (or will be removed from the list, as the case may be).", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-06-20T08:10:20.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-03-29T16:50:05.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-06-26T23:42:47.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-06-20T08:10:20.000Z", "columns_name": ["Entity Name", "Eminent Domain Entity ID", "Last Updated"], "columns_field_name": ["entity_name", "eminent_domain_public_id", "last_updated"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Calendar date"], "columns_description": ["Name of the entity claiming eminent domain authority", "Unique ID number for each entity claiming eminent domain authority", ""], "columns_format": [{"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "locked": false, "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-05-03T14:48:42.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["environment", "politics"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Government and Taxes", "domain_tags": ["eminent domain"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Microsite_Tags", "value": "Government and Taxes"}, {"key": "Microsite_Microsite", "value": "Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts"}, {"key": "Dataset-Category_Agency", "value": "Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts"}, {"key": "Dataset-Category_Category-Tile", "value": "Government and Taxes"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.texas.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.texas.gov/d/qpkm-pcgh", "link": "https://data.texas.gov/Government-and-Taxes/Eminent-Domain-Noncompliant-Entities-List/qpkm-pcgh", "owner": {"id": "rpyr-842j", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Information Management and Analytics (IMA)"}, "creator": {"id": "rpyr-842j", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Information Management and Analytics (IMA)"}}

Traditional investigations and Alternative Response require caseworkers to assess safety and take needed actions to protect a child while assessing any risk of abuse or neglect in the foreseeable future. AR cases present a less adversarial more collaborative approach to working with families by allowing for family engagement along with other community supports to ensure child safety.  AR differs from traditional investigations in that AR cases are Priority 2 cases involving victims who are age 6 or older,  there is no substantiation of allegations, no entry of perpetrators into the Central Registry (a repository for reports of child abuse and neglect), and there is a heightened focus on guiding the family to plan for safety in a way that works for them and therefore sustains safety. \n\nAlternative response is timely if the first face-to-face meeting with the family and children in the household occurs within five days of an AR stage being opened and will involve working with the family to conduct safety and family assessments.  AR cases can remain open for up to 60 days with a one-time 20-day extension, if appropriate. Should CPI staff identify services to improve general family functioning and overall protective actions within the standard AR case time frame, the caseworker will provide support in linking the family to existing resources within the community. \n\nA description of Alternative Response and how it differs from a traditional investigation and priority response times are in the glossary. \n\nAlterative Response has been fully implemented in Regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11.

Approaches used by communities to prevent delinquency have included mentoring, youth employment programs, career preparation, youth leadership development and recreational activities.  Communities prioritize and fund specific prevention services according to local needs. CYD services are available in 15 targeted Texas ZIP codes.\n\nFamily and Youth Success Program (FAYS) (formerly Services to At-Risk Youth (STAR)) - The FAYS program contracts with community agencies to offer family crisis intervention counseling, short- term emergency respite care, and individual and family counseling. Youth up to age 17 and their families are eligible if they experience conflict at home, truancy or delinquency, or a youth who runs away from home. FAYS services are available in all 254 Texas counties.

This authorization is derived from the U.S. Social Securities Act, Texas Family Code, Human Resources Code, Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, Indian Child Welfare Act and the Adam Walsh Act. \n\nCPI conducts either a traditional investigation or Alternative Response (AR).  Both require CPI to assess safety and take needed actions to protect a child and assess the risk of future abuse or neglect in the foreseeable future.  AR, however, allows for a more flexible, family engaging approach on lower priority cases involving alleged victims who are age 6 or older.    AR differs from traditional investigations in that there is no substantiation of allegations, no entry of perpetrators into the Central Registry (a repository for reports of child abuse and neglect), and there a heightened focus on guiding the family to plan for safety in a way that works for them and therefore sustains the safety. \n\nCompleted investigations only include those cases conducted as a traditional investigation that were not administratively closed or merged into another stage.  An investigation can only be administratively closed if all allegations have a disposition of administrative closure. A completed investigation can include more than one alleged victim.  Completed investigations do not include any Alternative Response cases.   A description of Alternative Response and how it differs from a traditional investigation is in the glossary. \n\nFOOTNOTES\nAn investigation represents a report of abuse or neglect and can involve multiple children.\n \nThe data on completed investigations does not include investigative stages that were administratively closed or merged into another investigation. \n\nAll completed investigations have a case disposition and a risk finding. \n\nVisit dfps.state.tx.us for information on Abuse/Neglect Investigations and all DFPS programs.", "attribution": "TX DFPS Data and Decision Support", "attribution_link": "https://www.dfps.texas.gov/About_DFPS/Data_Book/Child_Protective_Investigations/Investigations/Activity.asp", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-02-13T17:11:02.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-03-16T18:00:36.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-02-13T17:11:02.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-01-30T17:47:17.000Z", "columns_name": ["Region", "Completed Investigations", "Fiscal Year", "County"], "columns_field_name": ["region", "completed_investigations", "fiscal_year", "county"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "locked": false, "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-03-07T22:01:52.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["public safety", "infrastructure", "finance"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["abuse neglect investigations", "child protective investigations", "cpi", "cps", "databook", "data book", "dfps", "inv", "investigations", "oidb"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Microsite_Tags", "value": "Social Services"}, {"key": "Microsite_Microsite", "value": "Texas Department of Family and Protective Service"}, {"key": "Dataset-Category_Agency", "value": "Texas Department of Family and Protective Services"}, {"key": "Dataset-Category_Category-Tile", "value": "Social Services"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.texas.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.texas.gov/d/waxz-c9q5", "link": "https://data.texas.gov/dataset/CPI-3-1-Completed-Abuse-Neglect-Investigations-by-/waxz-c9q5", "owner": {"id": "kq9x-xmzg", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "TX DFPS Data Decision and Support - Interactive Data Book"}, "creator": {"id": "kq9x-xmzg", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "TX DFPS Data Decision and Support - Interactive Data Book"}}

When a network does not meet these requirements and has a deficiency in a county for a specific physician or provider specialty type, an insurer may apply for a waiver to continue operating within its service area. The commissioner of the Texas Department of Insurance (TDI) may grant the waiver following a public hearing and consideration of relevant testimony and information.\n\nAnyone may attend the public hearing and offer testimony.
