{"resource": {"name": "Juvenile Services Public Dataset Q3 2019", "id": "wevz-2trw", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Date of dataset: 9/30/19\nSource: PRISM (Probation Record Information System Management) PO-234 Report\nNotes: To ensure confidentiality and to protect the identities of individuals on probation, the ages of some individuals in the dataset have been withheld, and marked \u201cN/A\u201d. This is done to avoid possible re-identification through the available demographic information, or stigmatization of a group when they make a substantial percent of a designated population.\nNumber of records with ages withheld: 12\n\nThe Alameda County Probation Department (ACPD) collects information on all juveniles referred to the department and records this in PRISM (Probation Record Information System Management). Several reports are built into the PRISM system that allow ACPD staff to extract data for specified time periods. This dataset is derived from the PRISM PO-234 report. This report provides a dataset of all youth that have an assigned Probation Officer. Cases include formal supervision, informal supervision, intake, and investigations. The report provides a one-day snapshot of individual-level data on each youth along with demographic information. To create this dataset, the report was de-identified and edited to include the most pertinent information.\n\nData Characteristics and Known Limitations\n\u2022 To ensure confidentiality and to protect the identities of individuals on probation, the ages of some individuals in the dataset have been withheld, and marked \u201cN/A\u201d. This is done to avoid possible re-identification through the available demographic information, or stigmatization of a group when they make a substantial percent of a designated population. Please see the \u201cNotes\u201d tab in the public dataset file, which states the number of records with withheld ages in that dataset.\n\u2022 PRISM is a referral system rather than a case management system, and a youth may have more than one open referral at a time. Therefore, the analyst who creates this report must apply a hierarchy to determine how to count youth with multiple open referrals, since PRISM does not perform this function. The hierarchy employed for this dataset is as follows: Warrant, Placement, Community Supervision, Intake / Investigations, Truancy.\n\nDefinition of Terms\n\u2022 Age Group \u2013 age range the client was in on the date of report.\n\u2022 Gender \u2013 gender of the client as recorded at booking.\n\u2022 Race Group \u2013 race group of client as recorded at booking.\no Asian/Pacific Islander \u2013 a person whose ancestry can be identified as Asian Indian, Cambodian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Vietnamese, other Asian, Pacific Islander, Samoan, Guamanian, or Hawaiian.\no Black \u2013 a person whose ancestry is any of the black racial groups of Africa.\no Hispanic \u2013 a person of Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Central and South America or other\no Spanish culture or origin regardless of race.\no American Indian \u2013 a person whose ancestry is any Native American tribe.\no Other \u2013 a person who cannot be linked to any of the general or specific racial/ethnic groups\nlisted\no White \u2013 a person whose ancestry is any of the original peoples of Europe, North Africa, or\nthe Middle East.\n\nSupervision Type \u2013 The type of supervision the youth was on at the time of the report\no Community Supervision \u2013 youth on formal supervision and placed in one of the\nfollowing units at the time of this report: General Supervision, Community Supervision,\nFamily Preservation Unit, or Intensive Supervision.\no Intake and Investigation \u2013 youth at the intake stage who have been arrested and/or\nreferred to Probation, as well as youth at the investigation stage who have referrals that\nhave been petitioned to court and are pre-adjudication at the time of this report.

This is done to avoid possible re-identification through the available demographic information, or stigmatization of a group when they make a substantial percent of a designated population.\n\nNumber of records with ages withheld: 130\n\nThe Alameda County Probation Department (ACPD) collects information on its clients and records this in the Adult Probation System. ACPD staff run reports from this system that extract data for specified time periods. This dataset is derived from PRISM PO-216 report \u2013 Adults on Probation Data Extract 2. This report contains individual-level information for all adults on the ACPD caseload on date specified. To create this dataset, the report was de-identified and edited to include the most pertinent information.\n\nData Characteristics and Known Limitations\n\u2022 To ensure confidentiality and to protect the identities of individuals on probation, the ages of some individuals in the dataset have been withheld, and marked \u201cN/A\u201d. This is done to avoid possible re-identification through the available demographic information, or stigmatization of a group when they make a substantial percent of a designated population. Please see the \u201cNotes\u201d tab in the public dataset file, which states the number of records with withheld ages in that dataset.\n\u2022 Individuals may be on more than one type of supervision at a time. In these cases, the following hierarchy is used to determine their case type for the purposes of this report:\no Mandatory Supervision\no Post Release Community Supervision\no Other Status\no Formal Probation\n\u2022 The APS system has no built-in verification for address, city, or zip code. Therefore, address entries may be subject to human error or may be left blank. Current upgrades to the department\u2019s case management system will not allow incorrectly entered or blank address entries. Initial dataset releases will not contain residential city or zip code information.\n\nDefinition of Terms\n\u2022 Age Group \u2013 age range the client was in on the date of report.\n\u2022 Case Type \u2013 type of supervision case the individual is on at the time of the report\no Formal Probation \u2013 A term of community supervision ordered by the court as all or part of an individual\u2019s sentence for a felony or misdemeanor conviction. An individual on formal probation is supervised by a probation officer and ordinarily must meet with the officer anywhere from once a week to once a month. A formal probation term in Alameda County is typically three to five years.\no PRCS (Post Release Community Supervision) \u2013 A term of community supervision served by individuals released from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation after serving a prison commitment for non-serious, non-violent, or non-high-risk sex offenses (regardless of prior convictions). An individual on PRCS is supervised by a probation officer and serves a term of 12 to 36 months. Prior to the Public Safety Realignment Act of 2011 (AB109), the PRCS population was supervised by state parole.\no Mandatory Supervision \u2013 A term of community supervision defined by Penal Code Section 1170(h). Individuals on Mandatory Supervision have been convicted of felony crimes that are not eligible for incarceration in prison and instead are sentenced by the Court to serve their sentence in county jail or to \u201csplit\u201d the sentence between jail custody and a separate period of Mandatory Supervision. An individual on Mandatory Supervision is supervised by a probation officer and serves a term determined by the Court.\no Other Status \u2013 An individual on the Alameda County Probation Department caseload who is in the process of being transferred to or from another county per Penal Code Section 1203.9 or who is being supervised in a diffe", "attribution": "Alameda County Probation Department", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-02-19T23:43:59.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-02-19T23:37:12.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-02-19T23:43:59.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-02-19T23:43:59.000Z", "columns_name": ["UNIQUE ID", "Race Group", "City", "Gender", "Age Group", "Supervision Type"], "columns_field_name": ["unique_id", "race_group", "city", "gender", "age_group", "supervision_type"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-02-19T23:43:59.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["public safety", "health", "demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Probation", "domain_tags": ["adult probation", "probation"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.acgov.org"}, "permalink": "https://data.acgov.org/d/yni5-bjvq", "link": "https://data.acgov.org/Probation/Adult-Probation-Public-Dataset-Q4-2018/yni5-bjvq", "owner": {"id": "vptr-nj3r", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "ACDATA Admin"}, "creator": {"id": "vptr-nj3r", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "ACDATA Admin"}}
