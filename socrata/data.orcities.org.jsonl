These agreements ensure that cities are compensated for special use of public services. This also prevents city residents from subsidizing extraordinary use of public space. These agreements often take the form of contracts or city ordinances which outline the rate charged, term and conditions, and any extra services provided by either party. \r\n\r\nThe League asks cities their rates and rate calculations for telecommunication and cable franchises in the recent past.
