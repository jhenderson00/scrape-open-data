With nearly 1,800 miles of sewer lines throughout its service area, DC Water appreciates notification from the public if a sewer backup is suspected. Please call the 24-hour Emergency Command Center at 202-612-3400 at any time to report water or sewer emergencies in the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nDC Water is committed to protecting the health of the public and the environment. The Clean Rivers Project is a $2.6 billion long-term project to add capacity to the combined sewer system and reduce combined sewer overflows. In addition, the project\u2019s enormous storage tunnels may also alleviate some SSOs.
