CPHD understands that case counts may be higher, due to a number of factors:\n\n(1) Testing capabilities have been increased by other area lab organizations and hospitals and not all of the test results are reported to MDPH or CPHD.\n\n(2) People may be asymptomatic (or have very mild symptoms) and do not realize that they may have COVID-19 and need to be tested.\n\n(3) Providers may be offering diagnoses based on symptoms and history (rather than testing) and telling patients that they are likely positive and should stay home and self-quarantine for 14 days. (e.g, Someone might call their provider with a few symptoms and indicate that they were with someone from Biogen. In this case, the doctor may assume positive for COVID-19 and ask the patient to self-isolate at home for two weeks).\n\nThis is the process that the CPHD, and all local health departments, is following.\n\nTotal positive cases include total deaths.

The basemap data was developed at 1\" = 40' mapping scale using digital photogrammetric techniques. Planimetric features; both man-made and natural features like vegetation, rivers have been depicted. These features are important to all GIS/mapping applications and publication. A set of data layers such as Buildings, Roads, Rivers, Utility structures, 1 ft interval contours are developed and represented in the geodatabase. The features are labeled and coded in order to represent specific feature class for thematic representation and topology between the features is maintained for an accurate representation at the 1:40 mapping scale for both publication and analysis.

{"resource": {"name": "Municipal Wastewater COVID19 Sampling Data 10/1/2020-6/30/2022", "id": "ayt4-g2ye", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This dataset is no longer being updated as of 6/30/2022. It is being retained on the Open Data Portal for its potential historical interest.\n\nIn November 2020, the City of Cambridge began collecting and analyzing COVID-19 data from municipal wastewater, which can serve as an early indicator of increased COVID-19 infections in the city. The Cambridge Public Health Department and Cambridge Department of Public Works are using technology developed by Biobot, a Cambridge based company, and partnering with the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA). This Cambridge wastewater surveillance initiative is funded through a $175,000 appropriation from the Cambridge City Council.\n\nThis dataset indicates the presence of the COVID-19 virus (measured as viral RNA particles from the novel coronavirus per ml) in municipal wastewater. The Cambridge site data here were collected as a 24-hour composite sample, which is taken weekly. The MWRA site data ere were collected as a 24-hour composite sample, which is taken daily. MWRA and Cambridge data are listed here in a single table. \n\nAn interactive graph of this data is available here: https://cityofcambridge.shinyapps.io/COVID19/?tab=wastewater\n\nAll areas within the City of Cambridge are captured across four separate catchment areas (or sewersheds) as indicated on the map viewable here: https://cityofcambridge.shinyapps.io/COVID19/_w_484790f7/BioBot_Sites.png. The North and West Cambridge sample also includes nearly all of Belmont and very small areas of Arlington and Somerville (light yellow). The remaining collection sites are entirely -- or almost entirely -- drawn from Cambridge households and workplaces.\n\nData are corrected for wastewater flow rate, which adjusts for population in general. Data listed are expected to reflect the burden of COVID-19 infections within each of the four sewersheds. A lag of approximately 4-7 days will occur before new transmissions captured in wastewater data would result in a positive PCR test for COVID-19, the most common testing method used. While this wastewater surveillance tool can provide an early indication of major changes in transmission within the community, it remains an emerging technology. In assessing community transmission, wastewater surveillance data should only be considered in conjunction with other clinical measures, such as current infection rates and test positivity.\n\nEach location is selected because it reflects input from a distinct catchment area (or sewershed) as identified on the color-coded map. Viral data collected from small catchment areas like these four Cambridge sites are more variable than data collected from central collection points (e.g., the MWRA facility on Deer Island) where wastewater from dozens of communities are joined and mixed. Data from each catchment area will be impacted by daily activity among individuals living in that area (e.g., working from home vs. traveling to work) and by daytime activities that are not from residences (businesses, schools, etc.) As such, the Regional MWRA data provides a more stable measure of regional viral counts.

Demographic information includes gender, age range, and race/ethnicity.\n\nAbout the COVID-19 Rapid Testing Program:  On April 9, the Broad Institute, in partnership with the City of Cambridge and Pro EMS, launched a surveillance testing pilot program in Cambridge skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. The goal of the program is to gain an accurate picture of the true infection rate in these facilities by testing all residents and workers regardless of whether they have symptoms or feel ill. Positive cases among facility residents reflect three rounds of testing in April and May of all residents at the seven skilled nursing and assisted living facilities in Cambridge, as well as other testing ordered by medical providers. \n\nOf note:\n\nThe case count includes those who have recovered, are currently sick with COVID-19, and who have died from complications of the disease. Any category with a case count less than five is omitted to protect individual privacy. \nThe Cambridge case count reflects current data received from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. \n\nIt is important to note that race and ethnicity data are collected and reported by multiple entities and may or may not reflect self-reporting by the individual case. The Cambridge Public Health Department (CPHD) is actively reaching out to cases to collect this information.

In part, this was because of the compressed timeline due to the Covid-19 pandemic during the 2020 US Census. Municipalities and the State were unable to coordinate precincts and legislative districts, and as a result sub-precincts within 9 precincts were unavoidable. Voters in a sub-precinct are listed on a separate voting list and have different ballots from other voters in the precinct during State Elections.\n\nPurpose\nThis layer was created for general use by the Cambridge Election Commission and for public distribution.

Fluctuations in the count of chronically homeless persons recorded in the PIT data between 2012 and 2017 are attributed to variations in data quality, completeness, and collection methods in the midst of changing definitions and collection standards.   The subpopulation counts of persons with serious mental illness, substance use disorder, HIV/AIDS, and victims of domestic violence rely on self-reported data recorded in HMIS. Many HMIS records are missing this information, and providers report that because of the nature of these questions, many clients do not self-identify as belonging to these subpopulations, resulting in assumed undercounts and wide fluctuation among these subpopulation totals from year to year. Counts of unsheltered persons for these subpopulations was not required prior to 2013.

It is being retained on the Open Data Portal for its potential historical interest.\n\nThis table reports case classification and status data. \n\nThe \"test mode\" rows show confirmed and probable case counts for all Cambridge residents who have tested positive for COVID-19 or have been clinically diagnosed with the disease to date. The numbers represented in these rows reflect individual people (cases), not tests performed. If someone is clinically diagnosed and later gets an antibody test, for example, they will be removed from the \u201cclinical diagnosis\u201d category and added to the \u201cantibody positive\u201d category. Case classification is based on guidance from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and is as follows:\n\nConfirmed Case: A person with a positive viral (PCR) test for COVID-19. This test is also known as a molecular test.\n\nProbable Case: A person with a positive antigen test. This test is also known as a rapid test. \nA person who is a known contact of a confirmed case and has received a clinical diagnosis based on their symptoms. People in this category have not received a viral or antibody test. Whenever possible, lab results from a viral (PCR) test are used to confirm a clinical diagnosis, and if that is not feasible, antibody testing can be used.\n\nSuspect Case: A person with a positive antibody test. This test is also known as a serology test.\n\nThe \"case status\" rows show current outcomes for all Cambridge residents who are classified as confirmed, probable, or suspect COVID-19 cases.

Staff from the Cambridge Public Health Department (CPHD) or the state\u2019s Community Tracing Collaborative (CTC) follow up with all reported COVID-19 cases multiple times throughout their illness. It is through these conversations that CPHD or CTC staff determine when a Cambridge resident infected with COVID-19 has met the CDC criteria for ending isolation, which connotes recovery. While many people with mild COVID-19 illness will meet the CDC criteria for ending isolation (i.e., recovery) in under two weeks, people who survive severe illness might not meet the criteria for six weeks or more.\n\nActive Case: This category reflects Cambridge COVID-19 cases who are currently infected. Note: There may be a delay in the time between a person being released from isolation (recovered) and when their recovery is reported. \n\nDeath: This category reflects total deaths among Cambridge COVID 19 cases. \n\nUnknown Outcome: This category reflects Cambridge COVID-19 cases who public health staff have been unable to reach by phone or letter, or who have stopped responding to follow up from public health staff.", "attribution": "Cambridge Department of Public Health", "attribution_link": "https://www.challiance.org/help-center/covid-19-alert", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-11-03T21:10:23.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-11-23T23:36:59.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-11-03T21:10:23.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-05-11T20:00:57.000Z", "columns_name": ["Count", "Category", "Type", "Data Type", "%"], "columns_field_name": ["count", "category", "type", "dataset", "percent"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Number of cases in each category.

The Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department\u2019s Permit Year spans from November 1st through October 31st of the following year.  The Parking Permit renewal period spans from November 1st through January 31st of the following year.  This dataset will be updated semi-annually at the end of the Permit Year, and at the end of the Parking Permit renewal period, to provide users with updated information from before and after permit renewals occur. This dataset currently includes permit data for the entirety of 2017 and through January 31 of the 2018 permit year. \r\n\r\nThe dataset identifies the Census Block that each parking permit is located in.\r\n\r\nThe first person that applies for a Resident Parking Permit will automatically receive that household\u2019s single Visitor Parking Permit with their Resident Permit. For households without a vehicle or those who only require a Visitor Parking Permit, the associated fee is $25.00, except for Senior Residents (age 65 or older) or persons with disabilities.   \r\n\r\nThe Account Number field is associated with the first resident in a household who applied for either a Resident Parking Permit or a Visitor Parking Permit. If the resident applied for a Resident Parking Permit they should have an associated Visitor Parking Permit with the same Account Number.  \r\n\t\r\nEach permit is characterized by a permit type. The permit types in this dataset include: \r\n\r\nA1: Standard Cambridge residential parking permit. \r\nA2: Replacement residential permit. \r\nA3: Senior resident permit. \r\nG1: Visitor permit, no resident permit. \r\nG2: Visitor permit with Resident Permit. \r\nG3: Senior Visitor Permit Only. \r\n\r\nA Senior Resident could have both an A3 and G3 permit, or just a G3 permit.\r\n\r\nResident Parking Permits allow Cambridge residents to park their vehicles, including motorcycles, in locations throughout the City posted \"Parking by Permit Only\". The purpose of the City's Resident Parking regulation is to maximize the availability of parking for Cambridge residents while discouraging long-term parking on residential streets near commercially zoned areas or transportation access points.\r\n\r\nVisitor Parking Permits are provided to Cambridge residents for use by their guests to park near the residents\u2019 homes.

The basemap data was developed at 1\" = 40' mapping scale using digital photogrammetric techniques. Planimetric features; both man-made and natural features like vegetation, rivers have been depicted. These features are important to all GIS/mapping applications and publication. A set of data layers such as Buildings, Roads, Rivers, Utility structures, 1 ft interval contours are developed and represented in the geodatabase. The features are labeled and coded in order to represent specific feature class for thematic representation and topology between the features is maintained for an accurate representation at the 1:40 mapping scale for both publication and analysis. The basemap data has been developed using procedures designed to produce data to the National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA) and is intended for use at 1\" = 40 ' mapping scale. Where applicable, the vertical datum is NAVD1988.\n\nAbout Edit Dates\nThis data is automatically updated on a set schedule. The Socrata edit date may not reflect the actual edit dates in the data.

The dataset enables analysis of electricity usage patterns over a series of days, weeks, months and years; this can help identify opportunities to reduce energy use and demand and can be used as a starting point to correlate energy consumption changes with conservation measures. \n\nElectricity use is the amount of electricity that has been consumed over a certain period of time. Electricity demand is the maximum amount of electrical energy that is being consumed at a given time. Electricity use is measured in kilowatt hours (kWh). Electricity demand is measured in kilowatts (kW). Additionally, this dataset contains measurements for Power Factor and Reactive Power. Power Factor is the ratio of the real power that is flowing to the load and the apparent power that is supplied to the circuit. Reactive Power occurs in alternating current circuits when there is a phase difference between voltage and current. It is measured in kVAR for demand and kVARh for use.", "attribution": "Cambridge DPW and Mass Energy Insights", "attribution_link": "https://www.cambridgema.gov/theworks/energyefficiency",

{"resource": {"name": "Street Sweeping Schedule", "id": "uvf3-2xt3", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This dataset contains the street sweeping schedule for 2016. Public Works mechanically sweeps each street in Cambridge once per month, April through December (weather permitting). Signs are posted on each residential street indicating the schedule, which differs by city district and street side. In order to ensure that streets are properly cleaned, cars must move off the side of the street being swept to avoid being ticketed and towed. The Cambridge Open Data portal contains a related dataset called Street Sweeping Districts, which is a polygon layer illustrating the districts on a map. That dataset is available here: https://data.cambridgema.gov/Geographic-Information-GIS-/Street-Sweeping-Districts/upm7-2w6p. \r\n\r\n\r\nStreet sweeping does not occur on holidays. Sweeping that would otherwise fall on a holiday is rescheduled for an alternate date. This dataset indicates when sweeping is rescheduled for an alternate day due to a holiday. Holiday schedule is:\r\n\r\n\r\nPatriot's Day, April 18th will be swept on April 29th\r\nIndependence Day, July 4th will be swept on June 29th\r\nLabor Day, September 5th will be swept on August 29th\r\nColumbus Day, October 10th will be swept on September 29th\r\nVeteran's Day, November 11th will be swept on October 31st\r\nThanksgiving Day, November 24th will be swept on November 29th\r\nChristmas holiday, December 26th -will be swept on December 29th\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to neighborhood sweeping, City squares are cleaned daily: on weekdays from 7 am to 3 pm, weekends and holidays from 4 am to 8 am (street sweeping) and 6 am to 10 am (hand-cleaning crew).

The counts in this data set reflect only vehicle counts. An Average Daily Count measures the number of vehicles for an entire day, or an average of several days. Automatic Traffic Recorders (ATRs) log every vehicle that passes in each direction and this data is used to calculate Average Daily Traffic volumes and AM and PM Peak Hour Traffic Volumes for the street. The Peak Hour is average highest number of vehicles recorded during the morning and evening peak hour. Not all streets have the same peak hour. For example, the peak hour for one street could be 5 pm to 6 pm, whereas a peak hour for another street could be from 5:15 pm to 6:15 pm. The peak hour for a street can also change from day to day. When counts are done for several days, the Peak Hour count is the average of the highest peak hour over those days. \r\nAutomatic Traffic Recorders (ATR\u2019s) are rubber hoses temporarily affixed to the street. When a vehicle passes, a pulse of air passes through the hose and triggers an air switch in a recording device on the roadside. The recorder device is a small steel box powered by a battery. Air switch triggers are stored on board and later downloaded to a computer. Note: Traditional and older ATRs were not able to record bicycles, however, more recent ATR\u2019s (past 5 to 10 years) have been able to record bicycles that pass over the recorder.", "attribution":

The City Council comprises nine members and is the Cambridge's lawmaking body. \r\n\r\nProportional Representation (PR) is the method by which voters in Cambridge elect members of the City Council and School Committee. In a PR election you may vote for as many of the candidates listed on the ballot as you wish, but you must rank the candidates in order of preference. This ensures minority representation with majority control. \r\n\r\nThe vote count begins with the sorting of ballots by the first preference shown on each valid ballot. That is the NUMBER 1 vote on each ballot. This is generally known as the \"First Count\". Any candidates who reach the necessary quota with Number 1 votes are declared elected. During the 2013 City Council Election, the quota was 1,775 votes. Any extra ballots they receive beyond the quota are redistributed to the candidates marked next in preference (the number 2 preference) on those excess ballots. The count continues with the elimination of those candidates receiving fewer than fifty votes in the first count. Their ballots are redistributed to the other candidates according to the next preference marked. After each distribution, the candidate now having the lowest number of votes is eliminated and his/her ballots redistributed to the next indicated preference (number 2,3,4 etc.) As candidates reach the quota through the addition of redistributed ballots to their totals, they are declared elected and no further ballots are transferred to them.
