For the current version of this data, please refer to the new version, available here: https://data.cambridgema.gov/dataset/COVID-19-Cases-in-Cambridge-Daily-Snapshot/5dms-3pz8/data \n\nCOVID-19 cases in the City of Cambridge as reported by the Cambridge Public Health Department. This dataset summarizes cases by age cohort and gender.\nCambridge Public Health Department (CPHD) data regarding case counts come directly from MDPH and their surveillance system (MAVEN). We use the language and terminology per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance, and recent guidance categorizes all confirmed or presumptive positive cases as positive. CPHD understands that case counts may be higher, due to a number of factors:\n\n(1) Testing capabilities have been increased by other area lab organizations and hospitals and not all of the test results are reported to MDPH or CPHD.\n\n(2) People may be asymptomatic (or have very mild symptoms) and do not realize that they may have COVID-19 and need to be tested.\n\n(3) Providers may be offering diagnoses based on symptoms and history (rather than testing) and telling patients that they are likely positive and should stay home and self-quarantine for 14 days. (e.g, Someone might call their provider with a few symptoms and indicate that they were with someone from Biogen. In this case, the doctor may assume positive for COVID-19 and ask the patient to self-isolate at home for two weeks).\n\nThis is the process that the CPHD, and all local health departments, is following.\n\nTotal positive cases include total deaths.

Fluctuations in the count of chronically homeless persons recorded in the PIT data between 2012 and 2017 are attributed to variations in data quality, completeness, and collection methods in the midst of changing definitions and collection standards.   The subpopulation counts of persons with serious mental illness, substance use disorder, HIV/AIDS, and victims of domestic violence rely on self-reported data recorded in HMIS. Many HMIS records are missing this information, and providers report that because of the nature of these questions, many clients do not self-identify as belonging to these subpopulations, resulting in assumed undercounts and wide fluctuation among these subpopulation totals from year to year. Counts of unsheltered persons for these subpopulations was not required prior to 2013.   As noted above, information about persons in unsheltered situations is compiled by first conducting an overnight street count of persons observed sleeping outdoors on the PIT night to establish the total number of unsheltered persons.

The numbers represented in these rows reflect individual people (cases), not tests performed. If someone is clinically diagnosed and later gets an antibody test, for example, they will be removed from the \u201cclinical diagnosis\u201d category and added to the \u201cantibody positive\u201d category. Case classification is based on guidance from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and is as follows:\n\nConfirmed Case: A person with a positive viral (PCR) test for COVID-19. This test is also known as a molecular test.\n\nProbable Case: A person with a positive antigen test. This test is also known as a rapid test. \nA person who is a known contact of a confirmed case and has received a clinical diagnosis based on their symptoms. People in this category have not received a viral or antibody test. Whenever possible, lab results from a viral (PCR) test are used to confirm a clinical diagnosis, and if that is not feasible, antibody testing can be used.\n\nSuspect Case: A person with a positive antibody test. This test is also known as a serology test.\n\nThe \"case status\" rows show current outcomes for all Cambridge residents who are classified as confirmed, probable, or suspect COVID-19 cases.

Staff from the Cambridge Public Health Department (CPHD) or the state\u2019s Community Tracing Collaborative (CTC) follow up with all reported COVID-19 cases multiple times throughout their illness. It is through these conversations that CPHD or CTC staff determine when a Cambridge resident infected with COVID-19 has met the CDC criteria for ending isolation, which connotes recovery. While many people with mild COVID-19 illness will meet the CDC criteria for ending isolation (i.e., recovery) in under two weeks, people who survive severe illness might not meet the criteria for six weeks or more.\n\nActive Case: This category reflects Cambridge COVID-19 cases who are currently infected. Note: There may be a delay in the time between a person being released from isolation (recovered) and when their recovery is reported. \n\nDeath: This category reflects total deaths among Cambridge COVID 19 cases. \n\nUnknown Outcome: This category reflects Cambridge COVID-19 cases who public health staff have been unable to reach by phone or letter, or who have stopped responding to follow up from public health staff.", "attribution": "Cambridge Department of Public Health", "attribution_link": "https://www.challiance.org/help-center/covid-19-alert", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-03-25T20:00:58.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-11-23T23:36:59.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-15T17:44:50.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-03-25T20:00:58.000Z", "columns_name": ["Category", "Type", "Data Type", "%", "Count"], "columns_field_name": ["category", "type", "dataset", "percent", "count"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Case classification or status", "Case classification basis or name of case status", "Test Mode rows contain data about case classification based on test type and diagnosis criteria.

The Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department\u2019s Permit Year spans from November 1st through October 31st of the following year.  The Parking Permit renewal period spans from November 1st through January 31st of the following year.  This dataset will be updated semi-annually at the end of the Permit Year, and at the end of the Parking Permit renewal period, to provide users with updated information from before and after permit renewals occur. This dataset currently includes permit data for the entirety of 2017 and through January 31 of the 2018 permit year. \r\n\r\nThe dataset identifies the Census Block that each parking permit is located in.\r\n\r\nThe first person that applies for a Resident Parking Permit will automatically receive that household\u2019s single Visitor Parking Permit with their Resident Permit. For households without a vehicle or those who only require a Visitor Parking Permit, the associated fee is $25.00, except for Senior Residents (age 65 or older) or persons with disabilities.   \r\n\r\nThe Account Number field is associated with the first resident in a household who applied for either a Resident Parking Permit or a Visitor Parking Permit. If the resident applied for a Resident Parking Permit they should have an associated Visitor Parking Permit with the same Account Number.  \r\n\t\r\nEach permit is characterized by a permit type. The permit types in this dataset include: \r\n\r\nA1: Standard Cambridge residential parking permit. \r\nA2: Replacement residential permit. \r\nA3: Senior resident permit. \r\nG1: Visitor permit, no resident permit. \r\nG2: Visitor permit with Resident Permit. \r\nG3: Senior Visitor Permit Only. \r\n\r\nA Senior Resident could have both an A3 and G3 permit, or just a G3 permit.\r\n\r\nResident Parking Permits allow Cambridge residents to park their vehicles, including motorcycles, in locations throughout the City posted \"Parking by Permit Only\". The purpose of the City's Resident Parking regulation is to maximize the availability of parking for Cambridge residents while discouraging long-term parking on residential streets near commercially zoned areas or transportation access points.\r\n\r\nVisitor Parking Permits are provided to Cambridge residents for use by their guests to park near the residents\u2019 homes.

Planimetric features; both man-made and natural features like vegetation, rivers have been depicted. These features are important to all GIS/mapping applications and publication. A set of data layers such as Buildings, Roads, Rivers, Utility structures, 1 ft interval contours are developed and represented in the geodatabase. The features are labeled and coded in order to represent specific feature class for thematic representation and topology between the features is maintained for an accurate representation at the 1:40 mapping scale for both publication and analysis. The basemap data has been developed using procedures designed to produce data to the National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA) and is intended for use at 1\" = 40 ' mapping scale.

Public Works mechanically sweeps each street in Cambridge once per month, April through December (weather permitting). Signs are posted on each residential street indicating the schedule, which differs by city district and street side. In order to ensure that streets are properly cleaned, cars must move off the side of the street being swept to avoid being ticketed and towed. The Cambridge Open Data portal contains a related dataset called Street Sweeping Districts, which is a polygon layer illustrating the districts on a map. That dataset is available here: https://data.cambridgema.gov/Geographic-Information-GIS-/Street-Sweeping-Districts/upm7-2w6p. \r\n\r\n\r\nStreet sweeping does not occur on holidays. Sweeping that would otherwise fall on a holiday is rescheduled for an alternate date. This dataset indicates when sweeping is rescheduled for an alternate day due to a holiday. Holiday schedule is:\r\n\r\n\r\nPatriot's Day, April 18th will be swept on April 29th\r\nIndependence Day, July 4th will be swept on June 29th\r\nLabor Day, September 5th will be swept on August 29th\r\nColumbus Day, October 10th will be swept on September 29th\r\nVeteran's Day, November 11th will be swept on October 31st\r\nThanksgiving Day, November 24th will be swept on November 29th\r\nChristmas holiday, December 26th -will be swept on December 29th\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to neighborhood sweeping, City squares are cleaned daily: on weekdays from 7 am to 3 pm, weekends and holidays from 4 am to 8 am (street sweeping) and 6 am to 10 am (hand-cleaning crew).  Litter barrels in squares are emptied twice daily on weekdays and three times daily on weekends.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee the Cambridge street sweeping webpage at:http://www.cambridgema.gov/theworks/ourservices/streetcleaning/schedulesandroutes", "attribution": "City of Cambridge, Department of Public Works", "attribution_link": "http://www.cambridgema.gov/theworks/ourservices/streetcleaning/schedulesandroutes", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-07-05T15:43:57.000Z", "createdAt": "2015-07-28T12:54:02.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-07-05T15:43:57.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2016-05-18T13:27:50.000Z", "columns_name": ["MAY", "NOV", "DAY", "APRIL", "JUNE", "DISTRICT", "SIDE", "JULY", "AUG", "SEP", "OCT", "DEC"], "columns_field_name": ["may", "nov", "day", "april", "june", "district", "side", "july", "aug", "sep", "oct", "dec"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["The dates within this month when street sweeping takes place for each district and street side.

The counts in this data set reflect only vehicle counts. An Average Daily Count measures the number of vehicles for an entire day, or an average of several days. Automatic Traffic Recorders (ATRs) log every vehicle that passes in each direction and this data is used to calculate Average Daily Traffic volumes and AM and PM Peak Hour Traffic Volumes for the street. The Peak Hour is average highest number of vehicles recorded during the morning and evening peak hour. Not all streets have the same peak hour. For example, the peak hour for one street could be 5 pm to 6 pm, whereas a peak hour for another street could be from 5:15 pm to 6:15 pm. The peak hour for a street can also change from day to day. When counts are done for several days, the Peak Hour count is the average of the highest peak hour over those days. \r\nAutomatic Traffic Recorders (ATR\u2019s) are rubber hoses temporarily affixed to the street. When a vehicle passes, a pulse of air passes through the hose and triggers an air switch in a recording device on the roadside. The recorder device is a small steel box powered by a battery. Air switch triggers are stored on board and later downloaded to a computer. Note: Traditional and older ATRs were not able to record bicycles, however, more recent ATR\u2019s (past 5 to 10 years) have been able to record bicycles that pass over the recorder.", "attribution":
