This dataset summarizes cases by age cohort and gender.\nCambridge Public Health Department (CPHD) data regarding case counts come directly from MDPH and their surveillance system (MAVEN). We use the language and terminology per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance, and recent guidance categorizes all confirmed or presumptive positive cases as positive. CPHD understands that case counts may be higher, due to a number of factors:\n\n(1) Testing capabilities have been increased by other area lab organizations and hospitals and not all of the test results are reported to MDPH or CPHD.\n\n(2) People may be asymptomatic (or have very mild symptoms) and do not realize that they may have COVID-19 and need to be tested.\n\n(3) Providers may be offering diagnoses based on symptoms and history (rather than testing) and telling patients that they are likely positive and should stay home and self-quarantine for 14 days. (e.g, Someone might call their provider with a few symptoms and indicate that they were with someone from Biogen. In this case, the doctor may assume positive for COVID-19 and ask the patient to self-isolate at home for two weeks).\n\nThis is the process that the CPHD, and all local health departments, is following.\n\nTotal positive cases include total deaths.

{"resource": {"name": "Municipal Wastewater COVID19 Sampling Data", "id": "ayt4-g2ye", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "In November 2020, the City of Cambridge began collecting and analyzing COVID-19 data from municipal wastewater, which can serve as an early indicator of increased COVID-19 infections in the city. The Cambridge Public Health Department and Cambridge Department of Public Works are using technology developed by Biobot, a Cambridge based company, and partnering with the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA). This Cambridge wastewater surveillance initiative is funded through a $175,000 appropriation from the Cambridge City Council.\n\nThis dataset indicates the presence of the COVID-19 virus (measured as viral RNA particles from the novel coronavirus per ml) in municipal wastewater. The Cambridge site data here were collected as a 24-hour composite sample, which is taken weekly. The MWRA site data ere were collected as a 24-hour composite sample, which is taken daily. MWRA and Cambridge data are listed here in a single table. \n\nAn interactive graph of this data is available here: https://cityofcambridge.shinyapps.io/COVID19/?tab=wastewater\n\nAll areas within the City of Cambridge are captured across four separate catchment areas (or sewersheds) as indicated on the map viewable here: https://cityofcambridge.shinyapps.io/COVID19/_w_484790f7/BioBot_Sites.png. The North and West Cambridge sample also includes nearly all of Belmont and very small areas of Arlington and Somerville (light yellow). The remaining collection sites are entirely -- or almost entirely -- drawn from Cambridge households and workplaces.\n\nData are corrected for wastewater flow rate, which adjusts for population in general. Data listed are expected to reflect the burden of COVID-19 infections within each of the four sewersheds. A lag of approximately 4-7 days will occur before new transmissions captured in wastewater data would result in a positive PCR test for COVID-19, the most common testing method used. While this wastewater surveillance tool can provide an early indication of major changes in transmission within the community, it remains an emerging technology. In assessing community transmission, wastewater surveillance data should only be considered in conjunction with other clinical measures, such as current infection rates and test positivity.\n\nEach location is selected because it reflects input from a distinct catchment area (or sewershed) as identified on the color-coded map. Viral data collected from small catchment areas like these four Cambridge sites are more variable than data collected from central collection points (e.g., the MWRA facility on Deer Island) where wastewater from dozens of communities are joined and mixed. Data from each catchment area will be impacted by daily activity among individuals living in that area (e.g., working from home vs. traveling to work) and by daytime activities that are not from residences (businesses, schools, etc.) As such, the Regional MWRA data provides a more stable measure of regional viral counts.

Demographic information includes gender, age range, and race/ethnicity.\n\nAbout the COVID-19 Rapid Testing Program:  On April 9, the Broad Institute, in partnership with the City of Cambridge and Pro EMS, launched a surveillance testing pilot program in Cambridge skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. The goal of the program is to gain an accurate picture of the true infection rate in these facilities by testing all residents and workers regardless of whether they have symptoms or feel ill. Positive cases among facility residents reflect three rounds of testing in April and May of all residents at the seven skilled nursing and assisted living facilities in Cambridge, as well as other testing ordered by medical providers. \n\nOf note:\n\nThe case count includes those who have recovered, are currently sick with COVID-19, and who have died from complications of the disease. Any category with a case count less than five is omitted to protect individual privacy. \nThe Cambridge case count reflects current data received from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. \n\nIt is important to note that race and ethnicity data are collected and reported by multiple entities and may or may not reflect self-reporting by the individual case. The Cambridge Public Health Department (CPHD) is actively reaching out to cases to collect this information. Due to these efforts, race and ethnicity information have been confirmed for over 80% of Cambridge cases, as of June 2020. \nRace/Ethnicity Category Definitions:\n\u201cWhite\u201d indicates \u201cWhite, not of Hispanic origin.\u201d \n\u201cBlack\u201d indicates \u201cBlack, not of Hispanic origin.\u201d \n\u201cHispanic\u201d refers to a person having Hispanic origin. A person having Hispanic origin may be of any race. \n\u201cAsian\u201d indicates \u201cAsian, not of Hispanic origin.\u201d \n\"Unknown\" indicates that the originating reporter or reporting system did not capture race and ethnicity information or the individual refused to provide the information. \n\"Other\" indicates multiple races, another race that is not listed above, and cases who have reported nationality in lieu of a race category recognized by the US Census. Population data are from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2014\u20132018 American Community Survey estimates and may differ from actual population counts. \"Other\" also includes a small number of people who identify as Native American or Native Hawaiian/Pacific islander. Because the count for Native Americans or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders is currently < 5 people, these categories have been combined with \u201cOther\u201d to protect individual privacy. \n\nThe table is updated daily at 4 p.m.\n \n**Living in a facility is defined as a Cambridge resident who lives in a skilled nursing or assisted living facility.\n\n^Positive cases among facility residents reflect three rounds of testing in April and May of all residents at the seven skilled nursing and assisted living facilities in Cambridge, as well as other testing ordered by medical providers.", "attribution": "Cambridge Department of Public Health", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-03-01T21:00:55.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-11-23T20:28:06.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-15T17:43:39.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-03-01T21:00:55.000Z", "columns_name": ["Category", "Measure", "Percentage", "Count"], "columns_field_name": ["category", "measure", "percentage", "count"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-11-23T22:34:06.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["covid", "covid19", "covid-19", "health and safety", "v2"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Maintenance-Plan_Estimated-Update-Frequency", "value": "Daily"}, {"key": "Specific-Limitations_Limitations", "value": "This dataset only displays confirmed cases of COVID-19.

The customer intercept survey is slightly altered each year for the specific district in consideration, so the exact wording of questions and the questions asked are not necessarily consistent from year to year. \r\n\r\nIf a question was not asked in a given district\u2019s survey, \u201c[Question Not Asked In This District's Survey]\u201d is listed as the value. A blank cell indicates that the respondent did not answer that question, although it was asked.\r\n\r\nIn many questions, such as mode of transit, participants were asked to give one answer but often filled in more than one. On surveys after 2014, we captured all of their responses, rather than just the one.\r\n\r\nAll of the final reports developed from this data are available here: http://www.cambridgema.gov/CDD/econdev/aboutcambridge", "attribution": "Community Development Department", "attribution_link": "http://www.cambridgema.gov/CDD/econdev.aspx", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-22T19:22:18.000Z", "createdAt": "2016-10-28T15:41:57.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-22T19:22:18.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-01-10T19:29:41.000Z", "columns_name": ["Do you want more pharmacies?", "What would you eliminate from the district?", "What would you change abou the district?", "What is one word you use to decribe the district?", "Ethinicity", "What discourages you from shopping in [district]?", "What would make you shop/visit more often in [district]?", "Please tell me 3 types of businesses you would like to see in the [district] that are not here now.", "What particular businesses are you visiting today?", "What is the PRIMARY purpose for being in [district] today?", "How do you most frequently get to the [district]?", "How many times a month do you come to [district] for dining in evening?", "Do you work in Cambridge?", "Which types of businesses would you like to see in [district]?", "Ranking of Convenience Stores", "Ranking of Fitness Centers/Gyms", "Ranking of Specialty Food Stores", "Ranking of Healthcare (Dentists/Doctors)", "How important is the presence of cultural events in the district?", "Ranking of Restaurants (Take Out)", "Do you go to school in Cambridge?", "Ranking of Movie Theaters/Entertainment", "Race", "Survey Year", "Language", "Ranking of Restaurants (sit down)", "Ranking of Home Goods", "Ranking of Grocery Stores", "Do you want more restaurants (sit down)?", "Ranking of Florists", "Ranking of Pharmacy", "Ranking of Apparel/Clothing Stores", "District", "How would you rate access to parking?", "How would you rate the range of goods and services available?", "How important are the business hours within the district?", "how would you rate access to public transit?", "Residency", "Homeownership", "How often do you use services or shops in [district]?", "Ranking of Sporting Goods", "Ranking of Dry Cleaners/Tailors", "Ranking of Food Trucks", "Ranking of Farmer's Markets", "Ranking of Book Stores", "Do you want more healthcare offices (doctors/dentists?)", "Ranking of Accessories Stores (Shoes, Jewelry)", "Do you want more fitness centers/gyms?", "Do you want more movie theaters/entertainment?", "Do you want more specialty retail?", "Do you want more specialty food stores?", "Do you want more book stores?", "Do you want more hardware stores?", "How would you rate the friendliness of the district?", "How would you rate the quality of goods and services available?", "Gender", "How important is parking?", "How would you rate the cultural attractions of the district?", "How important is the price of goods and services available?", "How important is the infrastructure in the district?", "How important is the cleanliness of the district?", "How important is the friendliness of the district?", "How important is the range of goods and services available?", "How important is the safety of the district?", "Age", "What would you keep about the district?", "Ranking of Bars", "Ranking of Coffee Shops", "Ranking of Barbers/Hair Salons", "How long is your average visit (outside of work) to [district]?", "Ranking of Specialty Retail", "Ranking of Office Supply Stores", "Ranking of Hardware Stores", "Do you want more barbers/hair salons?", "Do you want more coffee shops?", "Do you want more convenience stores?

The dataset contains four rows for each year, including one row for each housing type: Emergency Shelter, Transitional Housing, or Unsheltered. The dataset also includes housing inventory counts of the number of shelter and transitional housing units available on each of the PIT count dates.\r\n\r\nInformation about persons staying in emergency shelters and transitional housing units is exported from the Homeless Management Information System (HMIS), which is the primary database for recording client-level service records. Information about persons in unsheltered situations is compiled by first conducting an overnight street count of persons observed sleeping outdoors on the PIT night to establish the total number of unsheltered persons. Demographic information for unsheltered persons is then extrapolated by utilizing assessment data collected by street outreach workers during the 7 days following the PIT count.", "attribution": "Cambridge Department of Human Service Programs", "attribution_link": "https://www.cambridgema.gov/DHSP", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-06-08T16:09:20.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-11-13T16:42:23.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-06-08T16:09:20.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2020-01-27T18:20:48.000Z", "columns_name": ["Total Beds for Households with Children", "Chronically Homeless persons", "Victims of Domestic Violence", "Female", "Persons in households with children", "Total Units for Households with Children", "Adults with Serious Mental Illness", "Number of Persons", "Non-Hispanic/Non-Latino", "Year", "Adults with HIV/AIDS", "American Indian or Alaska Native", "Male", "Housing Type", "Single Individuals", "Hispanic/Latino", "White", "Persons over age 24", "Total Beds for Households without Children", "Adults with Substance Use Disorder", "Number of Households", "Black or African-American", "Parenting Youth", "PIT Date", "Veterans", "Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander", "Transgender", "Asian", "Children under age 18", "Don't identify as male, female or transgender", "Unaccompanied Youth", "Persons age 18 to 24", "Multiple Races"], "columns_field_name": ["total_beds_for_households_with_children", "chronically_homeless_persons", "victims_of_domestic_violence", "female", "persons_in_households_with_children", "total_units_for_households_with_children", "adults_with_serious_mental_illness", "number_of_persons", "non_hispanic_non_latino", "year", "adults_with_hiv_aids", "american_indian_or_alaska_native", "male", "housing_type", "single_individuals", "hispanic_latino", "white", "persons_over_age_24", "total_beds_for_households_without_children", "adults_with_substance_use_disorder", "number_of_households", "black_or_african_american", "number_of_parenting_youth", "pit_date", "number_of_veterans", "native_hawaiian_or_other_pacific_islander", "transgender", "asian", "children_under_age_18", "don_t_identify_as_male_female_or_transgender", "number_of_unaccompanied_youth", "persons_age_18_to_24", "multiple_races"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Total Beds for Households with Children available (occupied or not) on the PIT night.", "Number of persons meeting definition of chronically homeless in effect on PIT night.

Fluctuations in the count of chronically homeless persons recorded in the PIT data between 2012 and 2017 are attributed to variations in data quality, completeness, and collection methods in the midst of changing definitions and collection standards.   The subpopulation counts of persons with serious mental illness, substance use disorder, HIV/AIDS, and victims of domestic violence rely on self-reported data recorded in HMIS. Many HMIS records are missing this information, and providers report that because of the nature of these questions, many clients do not self-identify as belonging to these subpopulations, resulting in assumed undercounts and wide fluctuation among these subpopulation totals from year to year. Counts of unsheltered persons for these subpopulations was not required prior to 2013.

If someone is clinically diagnosed and later gets an antibody test, for example, they will be removed from the \u201cclinical diagnosis\u201d category and added to the \u201cantibody positive\u201d category. Case classification is based on guidance from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and is as follows:\n\nConfirmed Case: A person with a positive viral (PCR) test for COVID-19. This test is also known as a molecular test.\n\nProbable Case: A person with a positive antigen test. This test is also known as a rapid test. \nA person who is a known contact of a confirmed case and has received a clinical diagnosis based on their symptoms.

This dataset summarizes cases by age cohort and gender.\nCambridge Public Health Department (CPHD) data regarding case counts come directly from MDPH and their surveillance system (MAVEN). We use the language and terminology per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance, and recent guidance categorizes all confirmed or presumptive positive cases as positive. CPHD understands that case counts may be higher, due to a number of factors:\n\n(1) Testing capabilities have been increased by other area lab organizations and hospitals and not all of the test results are reported to MDPH or CPHD.\n\n(2) People may be asymptomatic (or have very mild symptoms) and do not realize that they may have COVID-19 and need to be tested.\n\n(3) Providers may be offering diagnoses based on symptoms and history (rather than testing) and telling patients that they are likely positive and should stay home and self-quarantine for 14 days.

This test is used to diagnose an active coronavirus infection. \n\nAntigen test, also known as a rapid test. This test is used to diagnose an active coronavirus infection, with a faster turnaround time than PCR tests but more likely to return a false negative. \n\nAntibody test, also known as a serology test. This test can show if you have been infected by coronavirus in the past. Some people develop antibodies while they are still infectious. If you have symptoms, please seek viral (PCR) testing to confirm active infection.\nOf note:\n\nDates on the chart reflect results from tests performed during the current week. For instance, the June 7 count reflects results for tests performed from June 7-13.

The dataset enables analysis of electricity usage patterns over a series of days, weeks, months and years; this can help identify opportunities to reduce energy use and demand and can be used as a starting point to correlate energy consumption changes with conservation measures. \n\nElectricity use is the amount of electricity that has been consumed over a certain period of time. Electricity demand is the maximum amount of electrical energy that is being consumed at a given time. Electricity use is measured in kilowatt hours (kWh). Electricity demand is measured in kilowatts (kW). Additionally, this dataset contains measurements for Power Factor and Reactive Power. Power Factor is the ratio of the real power that is flowing to the load and the apparent power that is supplied to the circuit. Reactive Power occurs in alternating current circuits when there is a phase difference between voltage and current. It is measured in kVAR for demand and kVARh for use.", "attribution": "Cambridge DPW and Mass Energy Insights", "attribution_link": "https://www.cambridgema.gov/theworks/energyefficiency",

{"resource": {"name": "Street Sweeping Schedule", "id": "uvf3-2xt3", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This dataset contains the street sweeping schedule for 2016. Public Works mechanically sweeps each street in Cambridge once per month, April through December (weather permitting). Signs are posted on each residential street indicating the schedule, which differs by city district and street side. In order to ensure that streets are properly cleaned, cars must move off the side of the street being swept to avoid being ticketed and towed. The Cambridge Open Data portal contains a related dataset called Street Sweeping Districts, which is a polygon layer illustrating the districts on a map. That dataset is available here: https://data.cambridgema.gov/Geographic-Information-GIS-/Street-Sweeping-Districts/upm7-2w6p. \r\n\r\n\r\nStreet sweeping does not occur on holidays. Sweeping that would otherwise fall on a holiday is rescheduled for an alternate date. This dataset indicates when sweeping is rescheduled for an alternate day due to a holiday. Holiday schedule is:\r\n\r\n\r\nPatriot's Day, April 18th will be swept on April 29th\r\nIndependence Day, July 4th will be swept on June 29th\r\nLabor Day, September 5th will be swept on August 29th\r\nColumbus Day, October 10th will be swept on September 29th\r\nVeteran's Day, November 11th will be swept on October 31st\r\nThanksgiving Day, November 24th will be swept on November 29th\r\nChristmas holiday, December 26th -will be swept on December 29th\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to neighborhood sweeping, City squares are cleaned daily: on weekdays from 7 am to 3 pm, weekends and holidays from 4 am to 8 am (street sweeping) and 6 am to 10 am (hand-cleaning crew).

The counts in this data set reflect only vehicle counts. An Average Daily Count measures the number of vehicles for an entire day, or an average of several days. Automatic Traffic Recorders (ATRs) log every vehicle that passes in each direction and this data is used to calculate Average Daily Traffic volumes and AM and PM Peak Hour Traffic Volumes for the street. The Peak Hour is average highest number of vehicles recorded during the morning and evening peak hour. Not all streets have the same peak hour. For example, the peak hour for one street could be 5 pm to 6 pm, whereas a peak hour for another street could be from 5:15 pm to 6:15 pm. The peak hour for a street can also change from day to day. When counts are done for several days, the Peak Hour count is the average of the highest peak hour over those days. \r\nAutomatic Traffic Recorders (ATR\u2019s) are rubber hoses temporarily affixed to the street. When a vehicle passes, a pulse of air passes through the hose and triggers an air switch in a recording device on the roadside. The recorder device is a small steel box powered by a battery. Air switch triggers are stored on board and later downloaded to a computer. Note: Traditional and older ATRs were not able to record bicycles, however, more recent ATR\u2019s (past 5 to 10 years) have been able to record bicycles that pass over the recorder.", "attribution":
