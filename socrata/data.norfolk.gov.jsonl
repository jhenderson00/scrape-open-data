This information is protected under federal law. All personal identifying information about policy holders has been redacted, and data has been anonymized to census tract, reported ZIP code, and one decimal point digit of latitute and longitude. If mapped, flood insurance policies and claims may appear to be clustered at a particular location due to this anonymization.\nWhat all that means: you cannot search for an address to see whether it has flooded.\nHowever, among many things, this data shows flooding trends in Norfolk over the last 40+ years. It shows the census tracts that flood most frequently. And it shows where the largest number and highest value of claims occur.\n\nFEMA believes this historic release of NFIP data promotes transparency, reduces complexity related to public data requests, and improves how stakeholders interact with and understand the program. This is the largest, most comprehensive release of NFIP data coordinated by FEMA to date. This dataset allows for customizable searches to create reports, analyze and visualize present and historical NFIP data faster and easier than before. \nThis data will help FEMA build a national culture of preparedness by providing claims and policy information people need to make better choices about their flood risk and the insurance they need to protect the life they've built. \nNorfolk's Open Data team extracted city-specific information from the FEMA dataset.

Aligned with the City of Norfolk\u2019s Climate Action Plan, the City Council adopted a resolution in 2022 to achieve a 20% reduction in energy consumption by the year 2032 across 127 selected properties within Norfolk\u2019s building portfolio, totaling approximately 6,000,000 square feet. This action solidified Norfolk\u2019s commitment to the Better Buildings Challenge.\n\nThis dataset utilizes data from 2019 as the baseline year. Energy tracking tools, specifically EnergyCAP and EnergySTAR Portfolio Manager, are utilized to measure various metrics related to energy usage in the 127 properties. The primary indicators in the dataset for tracking energy consumption are the Source Energy Use (in kBtu) and the Source Energy Use Units (energy use per square foot). While the dataset covers metrics from 2019 to the present, the Better Buildings Challenge excludes data from 2020 and 2021 (due to COVID) when evaluating progress toward the 20% reduction goal by 2032.
