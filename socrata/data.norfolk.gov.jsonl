One important source of data is input from residents about their priorities and satisfaction with the services we provide. Norfolk last conducted a citywide survey of residents in 2014.\n\nTo provide up-to-date information regarding resident priorities and satisfaction, Norfolk contracted with ETC institute to conduct a survey of residents. This survey was conducted in the fall of 2022; surveys were sent via the U.S. Postal Service and respondents were given the choice of responding by mail, online, or by telephone. This survey represents a random and statistically valid sample of residents from across the city. ETC Institute monitored responses and followed up to ensure all sections of the city were represented. An opportunity was also provided for residents not included in the random sample to take the survey and express their views.\n\nThis dataset includes all survey data (including demographics questions and responses), with the exception of free form comments and the Ward and Superward that the respondent lived in at the time of the survey.

This information is protected under federal law. All personal identifying information about policy holders has been redacted, and data has been anonymized to census tract, reported ZIP code, and one decimal point digit of latitute and longitude. If mapped, flood insurance policies and claims may appear to be clustered at a particular location due to this anonymization.\nWhat all that means: you cannot search for an address to see whether it has flooded.\nHowever, among many things, this data shows flooding trends in Norfolk over the last 40+ years. It shows the census tracts that flood most frequently. And it shows where the largest number and highest value of claims occur.\n\nFEMA believes this historic release of NFIP data promotes transparency, reduces complexity related to public data requests, and improves how stakeholders interact with and understand the program. This is the largest, most comprehensive release of NFIP data coordinated by FEMA to date. This dataset allows for customizable searches to create reports, analyze and visualize present and historical NFIP data faster and easier than before. \nThis data will help FEMA build a national culture of preparedness by providing claims and policy information people need to make better choices about their flood risk and the insurance they need to protect the life they've built. \nNorfolk's Open Data team extracted city-specific information from the FEMA dataset.
