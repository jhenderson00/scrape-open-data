{"resource": {"name": "FEMA NFIP Claims", "id": "suf7-r643", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "First, a caveat: the NFIP data does NOT provide information specific to individual homes or parcels. This information is protected under federal law. All personal identifying information about policy holders has been redacted, and data has been anonymized to census tract, reported ZIP code, and one decimal point digit of latitute and longitude. If mapped, flood insurance policies and claims may appear to be clustered at a particular location due to this anonymization.\nWhat all that means: you cannot search for an address to see whether it has flooded.\nHowever, among many things, this data shows flooding trends in Norfolk over the last 40+ years. It shows the census tracts that flood most frequently. And it shows where the largest number and highest value of claims occur.\n\nFEMA believes this historic release of NFIP data promotes transparency, reduces complexity related to public data requests, and improves how stakeholders interact with and understand the program. This is the largest, most comprehensive release of NFIP data coordinated by FEMA to date. This dataset allows for customizable searches to create reports, analyze and visualize present and historical NFIP data faster and easier than before. \nThis data will help FEMA build a national culture of preparedness by providing claims and policy information people need to make better choices about their flood risk and the insurance they need to protect the life they've built. \nNorfolk's Open Data team extracted city-specific information from the FEMA dataset. The dataset included here represents almost 6,000 claims on record from 1977 through 2019, totaling 67 million dollars in damage in the City of Norfolk.", "attribution": "FEMA", "attribution_link": "https://www.fema.gov/openfema", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-03-27T14:59:12.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-07-31T12:34:01.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-10-20T21:48:25.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-03-27T14:59:12.000Z", "columns_name": ["Amount Paid On Contents Claim", "Census Tract", "Amount Paid On Building Claim", "Primary Residence", "Small Business Indicator Building", "House Worship", "Elevated Building Indicator", "BECS Definitions", "Rate Method", "Lowest Adjacent Grade", "Elevation Difference", "Occupancy Type", "As Of Date", "Non-Profit Indicator", "Agriculture Structure Indicator", "Community Rating Systems Discount", "Occupancy Type Definition", "Number Of Floors In The Insured Building", "Number of Floors in the Insured Buildings Definitions", "Elevation Certificate Indicator", "Original Construction Date", "Location Of Contents", "Flood Zone", "CI Definitions", "Date Of Loss", "Lowest Floor Elevation", "Obstruction Type", "Total Contents Insurance Coverage", "Post Firm Construction Indicator", "RM Definitions", "Basement Enclosure Crawl Space Type", "Condominium Indicator", "Original Nb Date", "Year Of Loss", "Base Flood Elevation", "Policy Count", "Reported Zip Code", "Total Building Insurance Coverage", "Amount Paid On Increased Cost Of Compliance Claim"], "columns_field_name": ["amount_paid_on_contents_claim", "census_tract", "amount_paid_on_building_claim", "primary_residence", "small_business_indicator", "house_worship", "elevated_building_indicator", "becs_definitions", "rate_method", "lowest_adjacent_grade", "elevation_difference", "occupancy_type", "as_of_date", "non_profit_indicator", "agriculture_structure", "community_rating_systems", "occupancy_type_definition", "number_of_floors_in_the", "number_of_floors_in_the_1", "elevation_certificate", "original_construction_date", "location_of_contents", "flood_zone", "ci_definitions", "date_of_loss", "lowest_floor_elevation", "obstruction_type", "total_contents_insurance", "post_firm_construction", "rm_definitions", "basement_enclosure_crawl", "condominium_indicator", "original_nb_date", "year_of_loss", "base_flood_elevation", "policy_count", "reported_zip_code", "total_building_insurance", "amount_paid_on_increased"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Checkbox", "Checkbox", "Checkbox", "Checkbox", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Checkbox", "Checkbox", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Checkbox", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{"precisionStyle": "currency"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true"}, {"precisionStyle": "currency"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"view": "date_time"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"view": "date_time"}, {}, {}, {}, {"view": "date_time"}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "currency"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"view": "date_time"}, {"view": "date_y", "noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {"precisionStyle": "currency"}, {"precisionStyle": "currency"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-10-20T21:48:25.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["finance"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Government", "domain_tags": ["census tract", "claim", "occupancy type", "year"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.norfolk.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.norfolk.gov/d/suf7-r643", "link": "https://data.norfolk.gov/Government/FEMA-NFIP-Claims/suf7-r643", "owner": {"id": "q847-u5c9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "City of Norfolk"}, "creator": {"id": "q847-u5c9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "City of Norfolk"}}
