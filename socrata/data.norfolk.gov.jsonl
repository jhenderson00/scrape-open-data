It supports Norfolk\u2019s initiative for cleaner waterways by reducing pollution and nuisance flooding, minimizing stormwater runoff, and collecting approximately 6,682 tons of debris per year.\n\nWhile the goal of the program is to ensure street sweeping occurs once per month for all neighborhoods, the program is currently experiencing delays due to long lead times on equipment repairs, hiring challenges, and inclement weather. The street sweeping schedule will be temporarily revised to a quarterly rotation until equipment challenges can be addressed. Areas with enforcement signage will continue to be swept monthly, and parking enforcement will not be suspended during this time.\n\nThis dataset reflects the recent changes in the street sweeping schedule, and shows a listing of the dates that curb in front of Norfolk addresses will be swept.

This information is protected under federal law. All personal identifying information about policy holders has been redacted, and data has been anonymized to census tract, reported ZIP code, and one decimal point digit of latitute and longitude. If mapped, flood insurance policies and claims may appear to be clustered at a particular location due to this anonymization.\nWhat all that means: you cannot search for an address to see whether it has flooded.\nHowever, among many things, this data shows flooding trends in Norfolk over the last 40+ years. It shows the census tracts that flood most frequently. And it shows where the largest number and highest value of claims occur.\n\nFEMA believes this historic release of NFIP data promotes transparency, reduces complexity related to public data requests, and improves how stakeholders interact with and understand the program. This is the largest, most comprehensive release of NFIP data coordinated by FEMA to date. This dataset allows for customizable searches to create reports, analyze and visualize present and historical NFIP data faster and easier than before. \nThis data will help FEMA build a national culture of preparedness by providing claims and policy information people need to make better choices about their flood risk and the insurance they need to protect the life they've built. \nNorfolk's Open Data team extracted city-specific information from the FEMA dataset.
