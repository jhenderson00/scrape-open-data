The markers in each county were numbered sequentially as they were proposed, preceded by NC (New Castle), K (Kent), and S (Sussex) to note the county in which they were located. Since the beginning of the program in the 1930s, the State of Delaware has erected more than 660 markers. The Delaware Public Archives has administered the Historical Markers Program since 1990. Community members and the state legislature have always played active roles in the Historical Markers Program. Today, every new state historical marker is the result of partnerships between the Delaware Public Archives, state legislators, and local community members. Funding for each marker comes as a result of a direct request to members of the General Assembly from interested individuals and organizations. As a result, the markers represent Delawareans\u2019 shared history and become a source of pride for local communities.", "attribution": "State of Delaware Department of State, Public Archives", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-03-31T15:00:44.000Z", "createdAt": "2024-03-01T14:49:11.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-03-13T18:13:00.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-03-31T15:00:44.000Z", "columns_name": ["Longitude", "Marker Photo URL", "Latitude", "Web Page", "Original Funding Sponsor", "Historical Category", "Marker Category", "Zip", "City", "Street Address", "Marker Name", "Marker Number", "OBJECTID", "the_geom", "Original Install Date"], "columns_field_name": ["longitude", "marker_photo", "latitude", "web_page", "original_funding_sponsor", "historical_category", "category", "zip", "city", "street_address", "marker_name", "marker_number", "objectid", "the_geom", "original_install_date"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Point", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Longitude of marker", "Marker photo URL", "Latitude of marker", "Web page location", "Original funding sponsor", "Historical category", "Marker category", "Zip code of marker", "City or Town", "Street address", "Marker name", "Marker identifier", "Internal feature number", "Internal geometry", "Original install date"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2024-03-01T14:49:13.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Education", "domain_tags": ["archaeological sites", "delaware", "firstmap", "historic boundaries", "historic markers", "national register"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Location-Intelligence_ESRIAPIEndpoint", "value": "https://enterprise.firstmap.delaware.gov/arcgis/rest/services/Society/DE_HistoricMarkers_Pending/FeatureServer"}, {"key": "Additional-Information_Geographic-Unit", "value": "Latitude/Longitude"}, {"key": "Additional-Information_Frequency-of-publishing", "value": "Quarterly"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.delaware.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.delaware.gov/d/p9mh-9mbb", "link": "https://data.delaware.gov/Education/Historic-Markers/p9mh-9mbb", "owner": {"id": "2cg8-ezyw", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Delaware FirstMap"}, "creator": {"id": "2cg8-ezyw", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Delaware FirstMap"}}

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2020 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program.  The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate.  The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.  When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions.  The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.  Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions.  In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.  They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.  State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy.  In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas.  These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous.  For the 2020 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2010 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt":

The baseline datasets were year 2012 digital CIR orthophotos and the State\u2019s existing 2007 LULC data. The data was digitally subdivided into working production modules based on the 1:24,000 scale USGS topographic quadrangle system. The LULC update was performed per the modified Anderson, et al., LULC classification and 2 acre minimum mapping unit (140\u2019 width) established for the State\u2019s previous LULC Update projects. The work was performed by Aerial Information Systems, Inc. (AIS) of Redlands, California.AIS staff analysts compared the State\u2019s existing 2007 LULC data to the 2012 project imagery. Every polygon was reviewed for change, accuracy of polygon boundaries, and adherence to the 2012 LULC classification and mapping criteria. Polygon boundaries and codes were modified as necessary through the addition of new lines and codes or the modification of existing arcs. In addition, large obvious errors in the 2007 data were retroactively (\u2018retro\u201d) corrected. The \u201cretro\u201d mapping process helps to ensure a more accurate baseline dataset for change analysis studies. The 2012 LULC interpretations were incorporated directly into the baseline 2007 LULC coverage to create a final composite coverage containing LULC information for both eras. Each polygon in the composite coverage was assigned an item for 2012 and 2007. Where no LULC change had occurred, the LULC class for both item years remained the same. Where a LULC change did occur, new boundaries were added to the data set as needed, subdividing the existing 2007 polygon, and the polygons were attributed for the appropriate 2012 LULC type. This method ensured that the different layers seamlessly co-registered to each other, creating a sliver free coverage for use in change analysis studies.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-01-12T18:50:03.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-08-23T13:42:52.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-01-12T18:50:03.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2021-08-23T13:45:00.000Z", "columns_name": ["LULC_Code2012", "SHAPE.LEN", "SHAPE.AREA", "OBJECTID", "LULC_Category2012", "the_geom"], "columns_field_name": ["lulc_code2012", "shape_length", "shape_area", "objectid", "lulc_category2012", "the_geom"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "MultiPolygon"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2021-08-23T13:42:54.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Location-Intelligence_ESRIAPIEndpoint", "value": "https://enterprise.firstmap.delaware.gov/arcgis/rest/services/PlanningCadastre/DE_LULC/FeatureServer/2"}, {"key": "Additional-Information_IsEsriImport", "value": "Y"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.delaware.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.delaware.gov/d/vgb7-dzz9", "link": "https://data.delaware.gov/dataset/2012-Land-Use-Land-Cover/vgb7-dzz9", "owner": {"id": "2cg8-ezyw", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Delaware FirstMap"}, "creator": {"id": "2cg8-ezyw", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Delaware FirstMap"}}
