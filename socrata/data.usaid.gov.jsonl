Specifically, the data set identifies Antiretroviral (ARV) and HIV lab shipments to supported countries. In addition, the data set provides the commodity pricing and associated supply chain expenses necessary to move the commodities to countries for use. The dataset has similar fields to the Global Fund's Price, Quality and Reporting (PQR) data. PEPFAR and the Global Fund represent the two largest procurers of HIV health commodities. This dataset, when analyzed in conjunction with the PQR data, provides a more complete picture of global spending on specific health commodities. The data are particularly valuable for understanding ranges and trends in pricing as well as volumes delivered by country. The US Government believes this data will help stakeholders make better, data-driven decisions. Care should be taken to consider contextual factors when using the database.

In fiscal year 2012, USAID's Office of Food for Peace (FFP) awarded funding to private voluntary organizations (PVOs) to design and implement a multi-year Title II development food assistance program in Niger. The main purpose of the Title II program is to improve long-term food security of chronically food insecure population in the target regions. FFP contracted a firm, ICF International to conduct a baseline study in targeted areas of the country prior to the start of the new program.  The purpose of the study was to assess the current status of key indicators, have a better understanding of prevailing conditions and perceptions of the population in the implementation areas, and serve as a point of comparison for future final evaluations.  Results would also be used to further refine program targeting and, where possible, to understand the relationship between variables to inform program design.  The study was conducted in 2013, while FFP expects to conduct final evaluations as close as possible to the end of the program five years later. In the process of migrating data to the current DDL platform, datasets with a large number of variables required splitting into multiple spreadsheets.  They should be reassembled by the user to understand the data fully.", "attribution": "ICF International, Inc.", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt":

The activity operated in eight regions and provided instruction in four languages. The target population of the study were Level II learners from selected woredas in the SNNP, Tigray, Amhara, Benishangul, Oromia, Afar, Gambella, and Somali regions where PACT-Ethiopia and its partners operated. Students were randomly selected to measure basic literacy skills targeted at the Grade 2 level using EGRA assessments in eight different languages. The EGRA assessment sub-tasks measuring basic literacy skills were incremental in their complexity. Each sub-task was presented to the child on a one\u2013to-one basis. Questionnaires were also administered to understand the background of the students.\r\n\r\nThis data file contains the project's endline EGRA.", "attribution": "PACT", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-01-27T15:06:25.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-10-05T18:32:22.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-01-27T15:06:25.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-01-24T21:00:17.000Z", "columns_name": ["region", "sernum", "q3_4", "q4a_4", "q4b_1", "q4b", "q5_2", "q5_3", "q5_1", "q5_5", "q2_4", "language", "q5_4", "q5", "masked_student_id", "q2_3", "q3_1", "q3_2", "q4b_4", "q4b_3", "q4b_2", "q4b_5", "sex", "q3_3", "q4a_2", "q4a_1", "q2_2", "q4a_3", "q2_1", "q1_4", "q1_3", "q1_2", "q1_1", "age", "mothertongue", "woreda"], "columns_field_name": ["region", "sernum", "q3_4", "q4a_4", "q4b_1", "q4b", "q5_2", "q5_3", "q5_1", "q5_5", "q2_4", "language", "q5_4", "q5", "masked_student_id", "q2_3", "q3_1", "q3_2", "q4b_4", "q4b_3", "q4b_2", "q4b_5", "sex", "q3_3", "q4a_2", "q4a_1", "q2_2", "q4a_3", "q2_1", "q1_4", "q1_3", "q1_2", "q1_1", "age", "mothertongue", "woreda"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Checkbox", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2023-01-24T21:00:23.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Basic Education", "domain_tags": ["all children reading", "early grade reading", "education", "egra", "endline", "ethiopia", "goal one", "primary", "transforming education for adults and children in the hinterlands (teach ii)"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Last-Update", "value": "3/3/2016"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "184:020"}, {"key": "Common-Core_References-Titles", "value": "Endline_EGRA_Notes.csv"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Described-By", "value": "https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/wjgn-gk82/files/58b279cc-4bdc-4be1-a017-65fc21cccb57"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Public-Access-Level", "value": "Public"}, {"key": "Common-Core_References", "value": "https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/wjgn-gk82/files/fd766c49-a03e-41cb-b63b-ddf9e3c1d5b0"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "USAID"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "R/P1Y"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "184:15"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Described-By-Title", "value": "Endline_EGRA_Codebook_M.csv"}, {"key": "Data-Asset-Profile_Sustainable-Development-Goal", "value": "4 - Quality Education"}, {"key": "Data-Asset-Profile_Gender-Disaggregation", "value": "yes"}, {"key": "Data-Asset-Profile_Individual-Dataset-Author", "value": "PACT"}, {"key": "Data-Asset-Profile_Countries", "value": "Ethiopia"}, {"key": "Data-Asset-Profile_Is-Certified", "value": "true"}, {"key": "Data-Asset-Profile_How-to-Cite-this-Data", "value": "PACT. 2023.

{"resource": {"name": "A genome\u2011wide association and meta\u2011analysis: Genome-wide association study (GWAS) results", "id": "wmek-4p42", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Seed size is an important trait for yield and commercial value in dry-grain cowpea. Seed size varies widely among different cowpea accessions, and the genetic basis of such variation is not yet well understood. To better decipher the genetic basis of seed size, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and meta-analysis were conducted on a panel of 368 cowpea diverse accessions from 51 countries. Four traits, including seed weight, length, width and density were evaluated across three locations. Using 51,128 single nucleotide polymorphisms covering the cowpea genome, 17 loci were identified for these traits. One locus was common to weight, width and length, suggesting pleiotropy. By integrating synteny-based analysis with common bean, six candidate genes (Vigun05g036000, Vigun05g039600, Vigun05g204200, Vigun08g217000, Vigun11g187000, and Vigun11g191300) which are implicated in multiple functional categories related to seed size such as endosperm development, embryo development, and cell elongation were identified. These results suggest that a combination of GWAS meta-analysis with synteny comparison in a related plant is an efficient approach to identify candidate gene (s) for complex traits in cowpea. The identified loci and candidate genes provide useful information for improving cowpea varieties and for molecular investigation of seed size.", "attribution": "University of California Riverside", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-01-27T18:45:38.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-09-04T16:46:42.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-01-27T18:45:38.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2020-09-04T16:48:24.000Z", "columns_name": ["Marker", "Chr.", "Pos (bp)", "(-)Log10P"], "columns_field_name": ["marker", "chr", "pos_bp", "log10p"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-09-04T16:48:24.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Agriculture", "domain_tags": ["agriculture", "cowpea", "feed the future", "food security", "genetic mapping", "innovation lab", "nutritional security", "resilience", "seed size", "snp genotyping"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Last-Update", "value": "2019-12-20"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "184:029"}, {"key": "Common-Core_References-Titles", "value": "Cowpea_seed_size__Lo_TAG.pdf, 122_2019_3407_MOESM3_ESM.xlsx"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Access-URL", "value": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00122-019-03407-z"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Public-Access-Level", "value": "Public"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Language", "value": "en"}, {"key": "Common-Core_References", "value": "https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/5j5e-uum9/files/5a74883d-2fd2-494b-b92e-7bdc7eac9cc4,  https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/wmek-4p42/files/13eaaa99-91bc-4494-bc49-af6477acbbad"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "USAID"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Homepage", "value": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00122-019-03407-z"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "184:15"}, {"key": "Data-Asset-Profile_Source-Link", "value": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00122-019-03407-z"}, {"key": "Data-Asset-Profile_USAID-Initiative", "value": "Feed the Future"}, {"key": "Data-Asset-Profile_Sustainable-Development-Goal", "value": "2 - Zero Hunger"}, {"key": "Data-Asset-Profile_Gender-Disaggregation", "value": "no"}, {"key": "Data-Asset-Profile_Individual-Dataset-Author", "value": "Sassoum Lo, Mar\u00eda Mu\u00f1oz\u2011Amatria\u00edn, Samuel A.

The assessment team collected survey data in two phases, each phase aligning with one of two selected periods of charitable and corresponding safe charity activities. Phase I aligned with activities relating to charitable giving during Ramazan and Eid ul-Fitr and collected data on decision-making patterns, knowledge, attitudes, and behavior with respect to the giving of zakat and fitrana during that period. Phase II aligned with activities relating to charitable giving during Eid ul-Azha and collected data on similar topics with respect to the giving of animal hides. The Phase II sample consisted primarily of individuals who had also participated in the Phase I survey. The primary limitation to the data from the Phase I survey was a snowball sampling approach to identifying survey respondents who had been exposed to safe charity messaging. For example, the survey team relied on farmer leaders, who had directly engaged with the safe charity campaign, to identify other members of farmer communities with knowledge of safe charity activities. While it was necessary to include \u201csecondary\u201d farmers in the survey sample to assess the reach of safe charity messaging within target communities, the survey team could not guarantee that secondary farmers had participated in safe charity activities or been exposed to safe charity messaging. Furthermore, there is a high likelihood of a selection bias in farmer leader referrals. To control for this bias, the survey team identified enough secondary farmers to create a secondary sampling frame, from which respondents could be randomly selected. The primary limitation to the survey of members of the business community was lack of familiarity with the safe charity campaign, particularly among corporate businesses. This may have been due to challenges identifying knowledgeable individuals within corporate businesses, lower level"}, {"key": "Proposed-Access-Level_Proposed-Access-Level", "value": "Public"}, {"key": "Embargo-Request_Embargo-Requested?", "value": "no"}, {"key": "Research-Fields_Informed-consent-obtained?", "value": "yes"}, {"key": "Research-Fields_Is-this-Federally-funded-research?", "value": "no"}, {"key": "Research-Fields_Does-this-dataset-contain-information-on-human-subjects?", "value": "yes"}, {"key": "Submission-Profile_Alternate-Submitter-Name", "value": "Babur Wasim Arif"}, {"key": "Submission-Profile_USAID-Alternate-Contact-Email", "value": "kkhan@usaid.gov"}, {"key": "Submission-Profile_COR/AOR-Email", "value": "snaseer@usaid.gov"}, {"key": "Submission-Profile_Submitting-Organization-DUNS-Number", "value": "048407589"}, {"key": "Submission-Profile_Operating-Unit-of-Origin", "value": "USAID Pakistan"}, {"key": "Submission-Profile_Award-Number", "value": "AID-391-C-15-00004"}, {"key": "Submission-Profile_Submitter-Work-Email", "value": "msuarez@msi-pak.com"}, {"key": "Submission-Profile_Alternate-Submitter-Email", "value": "bwarif@msi-pak.com "}, {"key": "Submission-Profile_USAID-Alternate-Contact-Name", "value": "Kaleem Ullah Khan"}, {"key": "Submission-Profile_COR/AOR-Name", "value": "Sadia Naseer Khan"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.usaid.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.usaid.gov/d/xcyw-a2zr", "link": "https://data.usaid.gov/Counter-Terrorism/Community-Resilience-Activity-CRA-Safe-Charity-Ass/xcyw-a2zr", "owner": {"id": "fkrw-mkyp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Lena Knezevic"}, "creator": {"id": "fkrw-mkyp", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Lena Knezevic"}}

Outputs from six climate models (CanESM2, CCSM4, CSIROMK3.6, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MPI-ESM-LR, and MRI-CGCM3) were used to construct the future climate scenarios. The whole country was divided into 17 watersheds based on the FAO watershed delineation. SWAT hydrological model was used to simulate the historical (1981-2000) as well as future (1941-2060) hydrological conditions.\n\nThe dataset has 57 variables and 895441 records.

In Multan, the campaign trained influential farmers to disseminate safe charity messages to other farmers; and chambers of commerce and industry, trade and marketing associations, and the Rotary Club to reach the business community. In Karachi, the campaign engaged community youth centers to disseminate messages. The campaign timed its activities to align with common periods of charitable giving, namely Ramazan, Eid ul-Fitr, and Eid ul-Azha. \r\n\r\nThese surveys established a baseline of current knowledge and

The assessment team collected survey data in two phases, each phase aligning with one of two selected periods of charitable and corresponding safe charity activities. Phase I aligned with activities relating to charitable giving during Ramazan and Eid ul-Fitr and collected data on decision-making patterns, knowledge, attitudes, and behavior with respect to the giving of zakat and fitrana during that period. Phase II aligned with activities relating to charitable giving during Eid ul-Azha and collected data on similar topics with respect to the giving of animal hides. The Phase II sample consisted primarily of individuals who had also participated in the Phase I survey. The primary limitation to the data from the Phase I survey was a snowball sampling approach to identifying survey respondents who had been exposed to safe charity messaging. For example, the survey team relied on farmer leaders, who had directly engaged with the safe charity campaign, to identify other members of farmer communities with knowledge of safe charity activities. While it was necessary to include \u201csecondary\u201d farmers in the survey sample to assess the reach of safe charity messaging within target communities, the survey team could not guarantee that secondary farmers had participated in safe charity activities or been exposed to safe charity messaging. Furthermore, there is a high likelihood of a selection bias in farmer leader referrals. To control for this bias, the survey team identified enough secondary farmers to create a secondary sampling frame, from which respondents could be randomly selected. The primary limitation to the survey of members of the business community was lack of familiarity with the safe charity campaign, particularly among corporate businesses.

It has 34 columns and 4,766 rows.  In fiscal year 2012, USAID's Office of Food for Peace (FFP) awarded funding to private voluntary organizations (PVOs) to design and implement a multi-year Title II development food assistance program in Uganda.  The main purpose of the Title II program is to improve long-term food security of chronically food insecure population in the target regions.  FFP contracted a firm, ICF International to conduct a baseline study in targeted areas of the country prior to the start of the new program.  The purpose of the study was to assess the current status of key indicators, have a better understanding of prevailing conditions and perceptions of the population in the implementation areas, and serve as a point of comparison for future final evaluations.  Results would also be used to further refine program targeting and, where possible, to understand the relationship between variables to inform program design.  The study was conducted in 2013, while FFP expects to conduct final evaluations as close as possible to the end of the program five years later.  The data asset is comprised of six datasets: 1) a description of all members of the households surveyed, 2) data on maternal health and sanitation practices, 3) data about the children in the household, 4) data describing the agricultural practices of the household, 5) data describing the food consumption of the household (broken into 4 smaller spreadsheets), and 6) and a description of the weights that should be applied during the analysis of the other datasets.", "attribution": "ICF International, Inc.", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2018-11-13T05:02:49.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-11-11T02:00:34.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-11-13T05:02:49.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2018-11-11T02:00:57.000Z", "columns_name": ["hhwt", "subcounty_name", "hh", "child_b", "wmwt_j5", "child_prob", "chwt", "substratum_ct", "farmer_b", "parish_name", "district", "women_e", "womenj5_prob", "farmer_prob", "care_prob", "child_d", "women_prob", "women_j5", "women_b", "farmer_g", "care_b", "wmwt", "households", "substratum", "interviews", "sampled", "stage1_prob", "fmwt", "vill_no", "care_j1", "j1wt", "geostratum", "program", "stage2_prob"], "columns_field_name": ["hhwt", "subcounty_name", "hh", "child_b", "wmwt_j5", "child_prob", "chwt", "substratum_ct", "farmer_b", "parish_name", "district", "women_e", "womenj5_prob", "farmer_prob", "care_prob", "child_d", "women_prob", "women_j5", "women_b", "farmer_g", "care_b", "wmwt", "households", "substratum", "interviews", "sampled", "stage1_prob", "fmwt", "vill_no", "care_j1", "j1wt", "geostratum", "program", "stage2_prob"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-11-11T02:00:58.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Humanitarian Assistance", "domain_tags": ["baseline survey", "ffp", "food for peace", "food security", "karamoja", "title ii development program", "uganda"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Last-Update", "value": "2017-07-15"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "184:016,184:018,184:019,184:029,184:037"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Language", "value": "en-US"}, {"key": "Common-Core_publisher", "value": "USAID"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Home-Page", "value": "http://www.usaid.gov/developer/FFPBaselineStudies"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Access-Level-Comment", "value": "Under the terms of an agreement with USAID, a partner owns data it collects.

We identified only one study documenting surface disinfection efficacy against the Ebola virus, showing a >6.6 log reduction after 5\u00ad-minute exposure to 0.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) based on small\u00ad-scale tests (Cook et al. (2015)). In preparation for future extensive, large\u00ad-scale disinfection efficacy experiments, we replicated the Cook et al. experiment using four potential BSL\u00ad-1 surrogates selected based on similarities to the Ebola virus: bacteriophages MS2, M13, Phi6, and PR772. Each bacteriophage was exposed to 0.1% and 0.5% NaOCl for 1, 5, and 10 minutes on stainless steel. MS2 and M13 were only reduced by 3.4 log and 3.5 log after a 10-\u00adminute exposure to 0.5% NaOCl, and would be overly conservative surrogates. Conversely, PR772 was too easily inactivated for surrogate use, as it was reduced by >4.8 log after only 1\u00ad-minute exposure to 0.5% NaOCl. Phi6 was slightly more resistant than the Ebola virus, with 4.1 log reduction after a 5\u00ad-minute exposure and not detected after a 10-\u00adminute exposure to 0.5% NaOCl.

We compared the efficacy of four chlorine solutions (sodium hypochlorite, sodium dichloroisocyanurate, high \u00adtest hypochlorite, and generated hypochlorite) for disinfection of three surface types (stainless steel, heavy duty tarp, and nitrile), with and without pre\u00adcleaning practices (pre\u00adwiping and/or covering) and soil load. The test organisms were E. coli and the Ebola surrogate Phi6. All tests achieved a minimum of 5.9\u00ad and 3.1\u00adlog removal in E. coli and Phi6, respectively. A 15\u00ad-minute exposure to 0.5% chlorine was sufficient to ensure less than 8 Phi6 PFU/cm2 in all tests. While chlorine types were equally efficacious with and without soil load, variation was seen by surface type. Wiping did not increase disinfection efficacy, and is not recommended as it generates infectious waste. Covering spills decreased disinfection efficacy against E. coli on heavy \u00adduty tarp but does prevent splashing, which is critical in Ebola contexts.

The purpose of the assessment was to garner an in-depth understanding of the business environment as well as the capacity and needs of Vietnamese participants. Pact then developed an augmented business training curriculum based on the results of the startup assessment.\r\n\r\nIn order to introduce mobile technology for an e-learning application/platform of the business materials, the assessment integrated information about participants\u2019 current level of capacity, the type of technology and devices currently most used by the women and their frequency of use.

The activity operated in eight regions and provided instruction in four languages. The target population of the study were Level II learners from selected woredas in the SNNP, Tigray, Amhara, Benishangul, Oromia, Afar, Gambella, and Somali regions where PACT-Ethiopia and its partners operated. Students were randomly selected to measure basic literacy skills targeted at the Grade 2 level using EGRA assessments in eight different languages. The EGRA assessment sub-tasks measuring basic literacy skills were incremental in their complexity. Each sub-task was presented to the child on a one\u2013to-one basis. Questionnaires were also administered to understand the background of the students.\r\n\r\nThis data file contains the project's 2013 baseline EGRA.", "attribution": "PACT", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-01-24T21:17:32.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-10-05T18:32:13.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-01-24T21:17:32.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-01-24T20:44:30.000Z", "columns_name": ["q4a_2", "q3_4", "sex", "q1_3", "q2_4", "q4a_4", "q4b_2", "q5_2", "q4b_3", "region", "q4_6", "q5_1", "q3_3", "q4b_1", "sernum", "woreda", "age", "q1_1", "q1_2", "q1_4", "clpm", "q2_1", "q2_2", "q2_3", "cfwpm", "q3_1", "q3_2", "ciwpm", "q4a_1", "q4a_3", "cpwpm", "q4b_4", "q4b_5", "q5_3", "q5_4", "q5_5", "q5_6", "masked_school_id", "masked_student_id"], "columns_field_name": ["q4a_2", "q3_4", "sex", "q1_3", "q2_4", "q4a_4", "q4b_2", "q5_2", "q4b_3", "region", "q4_6", "q5_1", "q3_3", "q4b_1", "sernum", "woreda", "age", "q1_1", "q1_2", "q1_4", "clpm", "q2_1", "q2_2", "q2_3", "cfwpm", "q3_1", "q3_2", "ciwpm", "q4a_1", "q4a_3", "cpwpm", "q4b_4", "q4b_5", "q5_3", "q5_4", "q5_5", "q5_6", "masked_school_id", "masked_student_id"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {}, {}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}, {"decimalSeparator": ".", "groupSeparator": ","}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2023-01-24T20:44:36.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Basic Education", "domain_tags": ["all children reading", "baseline", "early grade reading", "education", "egra", "ethiopia", "goal one", "primary", "transforming education for adults and children in the hinterlands (teach ii)"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Last-Update", "value": "10/27/2014"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "184:020"}, {"key": "Common-Core_References-Titles", "value": "2013_Baseline_EGRA_Notes.csv"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Described-By", "value": "https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/ymn3-qqfz/files/c61f30a5-e0bc-425c-b6c5-415966fce363"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Public-Access-Level", "value": "Public"}, {"key": "Common-Core_References", "value": "https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/ymn3-qqfz/files/8cdfe1c5-3ae6-40b6-90b5-c3668d105100"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "USAID"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "R/P1Y"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "184:15"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Described-By-Title", "value": "2013_Baseline_EGRA_Codebook_M.csv"}, {"key": "Data-Asset-Profile_Sustainable-Development-Goal", "value": "4 -
