The U.S. Household Food Security Scale is designed to register even occasional or episodic occurrences of food insecurity. Some households may be classified as food insecure or as having very low food security based on a single episode during the year.  An estimated 11.8 percent of American households were food insecure at least some time during the year in 2017, meaning they lacked access to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household members. That is down from 12.3 percent in 2016. The prevalence of very low food security also declined, to 4.5 percent from 4.9 percent in 2016.  A more complete picture of the temporal patterns of food insecurity in U.S. households sheds light on the nature and seriousness of the food access problems households face and can aid in the design and management of programs to improve food security.\n\nData was last updated on the USDA website in September 2020.\n\nAny data elements with numerical values reflect figures at the locality-level unless otherwise specified with an asterisk (*).

The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted roughly as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, see ACS Technical Documentation https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation.html). The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.\n\nAnnotation values are character representations of estimates and have values when non-integer information needs to be represented.

On March 3, 1865, the federal government created The Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands using the Freedmen's Bureau Bill. Also known as the \"Freedmen's Bureau,\" this agency was responsible for aiding refugees of the Civil War, especially formerly enslaved people in the areas of education, employment, and health care. Meant to last for only one year after the war, the Bureau was largely operational from June 1865 to December 1868, and officially abolished in 1872. Local offices of the Freedmen's Bureau assisted in drawing up contracts between formerly enslaved people and employers. These contracts were meant to ensure that the formerly enslaved were accorded fair and legal work contracts that included precise terms of employment. However because many formerly enslaved people were forced to enter into arrangements with former enslavers, arrangements could be largely ignored or abused. They eventually morphed into sharecropping and debt peonage. Contracts usually specify the dates of the expected employment, the occupation of the employee, expected wages and housing arrangements, and any rent that was to be paid to the employer. These records were generated by the federal government and therefore many are housed in the National Archives, however a few localities retained possession of these records in their courthouses after the dissolution of the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau in 1872.\n\nDescriptions included in this dataset are drawn directly from the original documents and may contain language which is now deemed offensive.", "attribution": "Library of Virginia", "attribution_link": "https://virginiamemory.com/collections/aan/", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-11-17T19:42:05.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-01-29T19:23:18.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-11-17T19:42:05.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-01-19T18:33:36.000Z", "columns_name": ["Freedman's Child(ren)", "Indenture Holder's Alias", "Additional Enslaved Names", "Barcode", "Year", "Surname", "Trade or Craft", "Additional Free Black Names", "Age", "Date of Birth", "Indenture Holder's & Hiree's Name", "Prior Enslaver/Indenture Holder's Name, if applicable", "Freedman's Spouse's Name", "Source", "Suffix", "First Name", "File Name", "Locality", "Physical Description", "Date Added or Updated", "Middle Name", "Freedman's Parent(s)", "Alias", "Gender"], "columns_field_name": ["freedman_s_child", "indenture_holder_s_alias", "additional_enslaved_names", "barcode", "year", "surname", "trade_or_craft", "additional_free_black_names", "age", "date_of_birth", "indenture_holder_s_hiree", "prior_enslaver_indenture", "freedman_s_spouse_s_name", "source", "suffix", "first_name", "file_name", "locality", "physical_description", "date_added", "middle_name", "freedman_s_parent", "alias", "gender"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Child(ren)  of individual entering indentured service", "Any aliases or nicknames of the legal holder of the indenture contract", "Any other names of enslaved individuals named in the contract", "Barcode identifier for the box housing the original document", "Year indenture contract was recorded", "Last name of individual entering indentured service", "Occupation or craft of  individual entering indentured service", "Any other names of free individuals mentioned in the contract", "Recorded age of individual entering indentured service", "Date of birth of individual entering indentured service", "Name of individual holding the legal contract for the indentured laborer or name of third party paying for use of the indentured laborer's labor", "Any previous indenture holders or enslaver of the individual", "Spouse of individual entering indentured service", "Archival collection where the original document is preserved", "Suffix of individual entering indentured service", "First name of individual entering indentured service", "File identification of digital copy", "City/County in Virginia where indenture contract was recorded", "Physical description, as recorded, of individual entering indentured service", "The date the data was added to the spreadsheet or the date it was last updated.", "Middle name of individual entering indentured service", "Parent(s) of  individual entering indentured service", "Any aliases or nicknames of individual entering indentured service", "Recorded gender of individual entering indentured service"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-01-19T18:33:42.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["housing & development", "transportation", "demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Education", "domain_tags": ["freedmens bureau", "indenture", "library of virginia (lva)", "virginia untold"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Geography_Primary-Locality", "value": "Commonwealth of Virginia - All"}, {"key": "Geography_Primary-Locality-FIPS", "value": "51000"}, {"key": "Governance_Agency-Website", "value": "https://www.lva.virginia.gov/"}, {"key": "Governance_Update-Cadence", "value": "Ad Hoc"}, {"key": "Governance_Responsible-Agency-Name", "value": "Library of Virginia (LVA)"}, {"key": "Data-Demographics_Contains-Age", "value": "Yes"}, {"key": "Data-Demographics_Contains-Gender", "value": "Yes"}, {"key": "Data-Demographics_Contains-Geographic-Area", "value": "Yes"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.virginia.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.virginia.gov/d/gaez-zqcc", "link": "https://data.virginia.gov/Education/Freedman-s-Contracts/gaez-zqcc", "owner": {"id": "6bst-yki8", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Jessi Bennett"}, "creator": {"id": "6bst-yki8", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Jessi Bennett"}}

(https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html)\n-Geography & ACS (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/geography-acs.html)\n-Technical Documentation (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation.html)\n\nSupporting documentation on code lists, subject definitions, data accuracy, and statistical testing can be found on the American Community Survey website in the  Technical Documentation section. (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/code-lists.html)\n\nSample size and data quality measures (including coverage rates, allocation rates, and response rates) can be found on the American Community Survey website in the Methodology section. (https://www.census.gov/acs/www/methodology/sample_size_and_data_quality/)\n\nAlthough the American Community Survey (ACS) produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities, and towns and estimates of housing units for states and counties.\n\nData are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted roughly as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, see ACS Technical Documentation https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation.html). The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.", "attribution": "U.S. Census Bureau", "attribution_link": "https://www.census.gov/en.html", "contact_email": null, "type":

A free person would be required to keep this document with them at all times. If a free person was found without a certificate they could be jailed. Free black men and women carefully guarded these documents in secure places on their person; the registrations that do survive have endured much degradation. The 1793 law required one to obtain a new certificate every three years. Both the registration system and the process of renewal was enforced differently in various Virginia localities. Not all free people registered in their locality.\n\nIf a free person moved to a different county, they were required to obtain a registration for that locality. If they did not, they could be apprehended by the local magistrate and taken to court. Theoretically, a person would submit their registration from their previous place of residence to the court as evidence of their free status. In some cases, a person would not have a registration to submit to the court.

In 1778, Governor Patrick Henry enacted legislation preventing importation of enslaved people into the commonwealth. Those that did bring their enslaved people were required to register them with the county court and sign a certificate of importation agreeing that they were not bringing enslaved people into the commonwealth with the intent to sell. The enslaved person is sometimes named, but not always, and occasionally information is given as to age, birthdate, and the state from which the individuals were moving.

{"resource": {"name": "Indentures of Apprenticeships", "id": "ks5z-4w2d", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Indentures of apprenticeship within Virginia Untold are composed of agreements binding out free Black and multiracial individuals, often children, to learn a particular trade or craft. These indentures may be written agreements between the family of the apprentice and those responsible for the indentured. They typically contain the name of the person or institution binding out, the person to whom bound, the name of the person being indentured, the length of the apprenticeship, and the responsibilities of the person taking on the indenture. \n\nIn 1765, the General Assembly established that illegitimate children of \u201cwoman servants, Negroes, white women by Negroes were to be bound out\u201d until the age of 21 for males and 18 for females. In 1792, the General Assembly transferred this responsibility to the Overseers of the Poor. White children were to be taught various skills including reading, writing, and arithmetic. In 1805, the General Assembly amended the previous act to no longer require the master of \u201cblack or mulatto orphans\u201d to teach reading, writing, or arithmetic, with the intent that this would prevent Black children from learning these skills. There are documented cases of indenture holders treating Black apprentices cruelly, or not releasing apprentices at the end of their indenture. White authorities also used their power to apprentice Black children without the permission of their families. Free Black men and women who had petitioned to be re-enslaved (see also Petitions for Re-Enslavement) were known to use this tool as a way of preserving the integrity of their families. Some parents bound out their children to a chosen master for a finite period of time, hopefully ensuring that the children would not be split up and remain free.\n\nThe data in this collection is drawn directly from the historical documents and may contain language that is now deemed offensive.", "attribution": "Library of Virginia", "attribution_link": "https://virginiamemory.com/collections/aan/", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-05-12T13:38:57.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-02-03T19:40:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-05-12T13:38:55.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-05-12T13:38:57.000Z", "columns_name": ["Indenture Holder's  Name", "Locality", "Additional Free Black Names", "Trade or Craft", "Apprentice's Parent(s)", "Prior Enslaver/Holder", "Indenture Holder's Alias", "Description", "Date of Birth", "Surname", "Middle Name", "First Name", "Year", "File Name", "Barcode", "Source", "Alias", "Date Added or Updated", "Age", "Gender"], "columns_field_name": ["indenture_holder_s_name", "locality", "additional_free_black_names", "trade_or_craft", "apprentice_s_parent", "prior_enslaver_holder", "indenture_holder_s_alias", "description", "date_of_birth", "surname", "middle_name", "first_name", "year", "file_name", "barcode", "source", "alias", "date_added", "age", "gender"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Name of individual holding the legal right to the indentured apprentice's labor", "City/County in Virginia where the indenture contract was recorded", "Any other names of free Black individuals mentioned in the contract", "Profession that the indentured apprenticeship will be practicing", "Name of indentured apprentice's parent(s)", "Name of prior individual holding the legal right to the indentured apprentice's labor or enslaver is formerly enslaved", "Any aliases or nicknames of individual holding the legal right to the indentured apprentice's labor", "Description of indentured apprentice, as recorded", "Recorded date of birth of the individual entering an indenture as an apprentice", "Last name of the individual entering an indenture as an apprentice", "Middle name of the individual entering an indenture as an apprentice", "First name of the individual entering an indenture as an apprentice", "Year that indenture was recorded", "File identification of digital copy", "Barcode identifier for the box housing the original document", "Archival collection where the physical copy is located", "Any aliases or nicknames of the individual entering an indenture as an apprentice", "The date the data was added to the spreadsheet or the date it was last updated.", "Recorded age of the individual entering an indenture as an apprentice", "Recorded gender of the individual entering an indenture as an apprentice"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2021-11-23T17:21:46.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["housing & development", "transportation", "demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Education", "domain_tags": ["indenture", "library of virginia (lva)", "virginia untold"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Governance_Update-Cadence", "value": "Ad Hoc"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.virginia.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.virginia.gov/d/ks5z-4w2d", "link": "https://data.virginia.gov/Education/Indentures-of-Apprenticeships/ks5z-4w2d", "owner": {"id": "6bst-yki8", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Jessi Bennett"}, "creator": {"id": "6bst-yki8", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Jessi Bennett"}}
{"resource": {"name": "Commonwealth Causes", "id": "kt9j-dgjb", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Commonwealth causes are criminal court cases filed by the state government that consist primarily of warrants, summons, subpoenas, indictments, recognizances, and verdicts handed down by juries and other legal authorities in order to prosecute individuals who violated the penal code. Some commonwealth causes commonly found in Virginia Untold include cases against enslavers who permitted their enslaved people to travel as free people without permission or permitting a gathering of enslaved people on their property. White Virginians and legislators feared insurrection and passed laws restricting the number of Black and multiracial people allowed to gather in groups. Other cases found in this collection might include crimes committed by both enslaved and free Black people such as breaking and entering, stealing, assault, murder, arson, and aiding enslaved people to self-emancipate. Formerly enslaved men and women could also be tried for remaining in the commonwealth more than one year following emancipation. In 1806, the General Assembly passed a law stating that all formerly enslaved people freed after May 1, 1806, were required to leave the commonwealth. Those who remained in the commonwealth more than twelve months could be put on trial by the state, and if found guilty, would be re-enslaved and sold. The proceeds from the sale went to the state treasury, and often, records of those sales can be found in the Public Claims records from the Auditor of Public Accounts. \n<br><br>\nThe commonwealth causes reveal an inconsistency in forms of conviction and punishment for white versus Black and multiracial individuals. Throughout the early nineteenth century, Virginia legislators revised the laws in ways that reduced the legal status of free Black and multiracial people to that of enslaved, thereby creating a legal system based on race. In 1831, Nat Turner led a revolt in Southampton County that prompted more legal restrictions on Virginia\u2019s Black population including prohibiting Black people to learn to read and write, practice certain trades, and sell goods. After 1832, Virginia law required free Blacks to stand trial in the same courts as enslaved people, known as Oyer and Terminer. In various years, free Black men and women were sold into slavery as punishment for certain crimes. While public whipping originated as a form of punishment for all those convicted, in Virginia, it was retained for those who were Black, free or enslaved, and officially outlawed as a punishment for white criminals in 1848. Often, Black individuals served much longer penitentiary sentences while the cases of white men, who had committed the same or similar crimes, were dismissed. \n<br><br>\nIn the eighteenth century, many enslaved people convicted of capital crimes were hanged. To curb the spectacle of so many public executions, an 1801 law allowed the governor to sell condemned enslaved people to those who agreed to transport them out of Virginia. The state hoped that by exiling these individuals, they would not commit a second offense in the commonwealth. In 1858, another change occurred when the state realized that they were losing money on convicted felons. Additionally, territories such as the West Indies and states in the Deep South such as Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana were no longer interested in receiving enslaved felons. The new act allowed the governor to commute sentences of transportation to labor on the public works for life. Commuting sentences meant that the state assigned enslaved people a value, and their enslavers received payment from the state for their human property. Enslavers submitted public claims to the Auditor of Public Accounts, the chief auditor and accountant of the Virginia General Assembly and the records of those sales can be found in Public Claims.\n<br><br>", "attribution": "Library of Virginia", "attribution_link": "https://virginiamemory.com/collections/aan/", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-06-14T14:46:10.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-01-29T14:56:32.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-06-14T14:46:10.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-06-14T14:13:06.000Z", "columns_name": ["Locality", "Deponents/Affiants", "Additional Free Black Names", "Defendant's Legal Status", "Additional Defendants", "Enslaver", "Narrative Charge", "Standardized Charge", "Additional Enslaved Individuals Mentioned", "Sentence", "Defendant Surname", "Defendant Alias", "Source", "Date Added or Updated", "Barcode", "File Name", "Year", "Defendant First Name", "Defendant Middle Name"], "columns_field_name": ["locality", "deponents_affiants", "additional_free_black_names", "defendant_s_legal_status", "additional_defendants", "enslaver", "charge", "standardized_charge", "additional_enslaved", "sentence", "defendant_surname", "defendant_alias", "source", "date_added", "barcode", "file_name", "year", "defendant_first_name", "defendant_middle_name"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["County/City in Virginia that the case was tried", "Names of any witnesses called in the case", "Any other free persons named in the case", "Whether the accused was legally regarded as free or enslaved", "Any additional accused individuals cited in the case", "Name of the enslaver if the accused was enslaved", "Summary of the charge(s) often including language from the original document and/or referencing the legal code", "Charge(s) filed against the accused person  This field was standardized by LVA staff into one of the following: \"Advising an enslaved person to abscond\", \"Arson\", \"Assault against an enslaved person\", \"Assault against a free Black person\", \"Assault against a white person\", \"Burglary\", \"Breaking Sabbath\", \"Consumption and/or Distribution of Alcohol\", \"Contempt of Court\", \"Disrupting the Peace\", \"Failing to enforce laws around enslaved and free Black people\", \"Firearms\", \"Forgery\", \"Gambling\", \"Grave Robbing\", \"Going at Large,\" \"Harming or Killing Livestock\". \"Homicide,\" \"Kidnapping\", \"Keeping an Unlicensed Business,\" \"Labor involving enslaved or free Black people\". \"Remaining in the Commonwealth\", \"Resisting Authority\", \"Sexual Violence\", \"Sexual Relations\", \"Stealing\", \"Trafficking enslaved people\", \"Verbal Assault\". \"Unlawful Assembly\", \"Unspecified\"", "Any other enslaved individuals named in the case", "Sentence issued on the accused/defendant", "Last name of the accused person in the case", "Any aliases or nicknames of the the accused person in the case", "Archival collection where the original document is preserved", "The date the data was added to the spreadsheet or the date it was last updated.", "Barcode identifier for the box housing the original document", "File identification of digital copy", "Year the case was recorded", "First name of the accused person in the case", "Middle name of the accused person in the case"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2023-06-14T14:13:12.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["housing & development", "environment", "transportation"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Education", "domain_tags": ["antebellum", "justice system", "library of virginia (lva)", "slavery", "virginia untold"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Governance_Update-Cadence", "value": "Ad Hoc"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.virginia.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.virginia.gov/d/kt9j-dgjb", "link": "https://data.virginia.gov/Education/Commonwealth-Causes/kt9j-dgjb", "owner": {"id": "6bst-yki8", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Jessi Bennett"}, "creator": {"id": "6bst-yki8", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Jessi Bennett"}}

{"resource": {"name": "Petitions to Remain", "id": "m4n7-r6pa", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Sometimes referred to as \u201cApplications to Remain\u201d, these records are applications that formerly enslaved individuals submitted to state and local courts for permission to remain in Virginia with their free status. An early 1691 law required a formerly enslaved person to relocate outside the commonwealth within six months of emancipation. In 1782, Virginia law allowed enslavers to emancipate their enslaved people \u201cby last will and testament or other instrument in writing sealed and witnessed to emancipate and set free his slave or slaves.\u201d Realizing that many enslavers were taking advantage of this, the Virginia General Assembly reacted by trying to suppress the growing number of free Black and multiracial people in the commonwealth. They passed a law stating that all formerly enslaved people freed after May 1, 1806 who remained in Virginia more than twelve months could be put on trial by the state. After 1831, if these people were found guilty, they could be re-enslaved and sold by state officials. The proceeds from the sale went to the state treasury, and often, records of those sales can be found in the Public Claims records from the Auditor of Public Accounts. The act required individuals who wished to remain in the commonwealth to petition the state legislature. Beginning in 1837, formerly enslaved individuals could petition the local courts directly for permission. The law required them to place notice on the courthouse door for two months before a hearing. \n\nThe documents in these cases will include: the name(s) of the petitioner(s), the circumstances of free status, and a request to remain in the county. Application packets might also include supporting documents such as the formerly enslaved person\u2019s register (for more, see Free Black Registrations), or other evidence for emancipation such as a copy of a will or deed of emancipation.

Contains estimates and margins of error.\n\nSpecial data considerations:  Large negative values do exist (more detail below) and should be addressed prior to graphing or aggregating the data.\n\nA value of -666,666,666 in the estimate column indicates that either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute an estimate, or a ratio of medians cannot be calculated because one or both of the median estimates falls in the lowest interval or upper interval of an open-ended distribution.\n\nA value of -222,222,222 in the margin of error column indicates that either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute a standard error and thus the margin of error.

(https://www.census.gov/acs/www/methodology/sample_size_and_data_quality/)\n\nAlthough the American Community Survey (ACS) produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities, and towns and estimates of housing units for states and counties.\n\nData are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted roughly as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, see ACS Technical Documentation https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation.html). The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.\n\nAnnotation values are character representations of estimates and have values when non-integer information needs to be represented.  Below are a few examples.  Complete information is available on the ACS website under Notes on ACS Estimate and Annotation Values.

For each state and the District of Columbia, employment status data are tabulated for 67 sex, race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, marital status, and detailed age categories and evaluated against a minimum base, calculated to reflect an expected maximum coefficient of variation (CV) of 50 percent, to determine reliability for publication.\n\nThe CPS sample was redesigned in 2014\u201315 to reflect the distribution of the population as of the 2010 Census. At the same time, BLS developed improved techniques for calculating minimum bases. These changes resulted in generally higher minimum bases of unemployment, leading to the publication of fewer state-demographic groups beginning in 2015. The most notable impact was on the detailed age categories, particularly the teenage and age 65 and older groups. In an effort to extend coverage, BLS introduced a version of the expanded state employment status demographic table with intermediate age categories, collapsing the seven categories historically included down to three. Ages 16\u201319 and 20\u201324 were combined into a 16\u201324 year-old category, ages 25\u201334, 35\u201344, and 45\u201354 were combined into a 25\u201354 year-old category, and ages 55\u201364 and 65 and older were combined into a 55-years-and-older category. These intermediate age data are tabulated for the total population, as well as the four race and ethnicity groups, and then are evaluated against the unemployment minimum bases. The more detailed age categories continue to be available in the main version of the expanded table, where the minimum base was met.\n\nAdditional information on the uses and limitations of statewide data from the CPS can be found in the document Notes on Using Current Population Survey (https://www.bls.gov/lau/notescps.htm) Subnational Data and in Appendix B of the bulletin Geographic Profile of Employment and Unemployment (https://www.bls.gov/opub/geographic-profile/home.htm).", "attribution": "U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics", "attribution_link": "https://www.bls.gov/", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-12-09T15:15:31.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-01-27T18:13:45.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-12-09T15:15:31.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-10-13T04:20:30.000Z", "columns_name": ["GroupCode", "Year", "CivilianLaborForce", "CivilianNonInstitutionalPopulation", "CivilianLaborForcePercentOfPopulation", "CivilianLaborForceEmployed", "CivilianLaborForceEmployedPercentOfPopulation", "CivilianLaborForceUnemployed", "CivilianLaborForceUnemployedRate", "ErrorRangeOfRate", "StateFIPSCode", "StateName", "PopulationGroup"], "columns_field_name": ["groupcode", "year", "civilianlaborforce", "civiliannoninstitutional", "civilianlaborforcepercen", "civilianlaborforceemployed", "civilianlaborforceemploy", "civilianlaborforceunemployed", "civilianlaborforceunempl", "errorrangeofrate", "statefipscode", "statename", "populationgroup"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Integer for corresponding Population Group.", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "Population or Demographic Group."], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-10-12T23:02:53.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "economy", "finance"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Economy", "domain_tags": ["employment", "socioeconomic", "transportation planning"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Geography_Primary-Locality", "value": "Commonwealth of Virginia - All"}, {"key": "Geography_Primary-Locality-FIPS", "value": "51000"}, {"key": "Governance_Update-Cadence", "value": "Annually"}, {"key": "Data-Demographics_Contains-Age", "value": "Yes"}, {"key": "Data-Demographics_Contains-Gender", "value": "Yes"}, {"key": "Data-Demographics_Contains-Geographic-Area", "value": "Yes"}, {"key": "Data-Demographics_Contains-Race/Ethnicity", "value": "Yes"}, {"key": "Data-Demographics_Contains-Employment-Status", "value": "Yes"}, {"key": "Responsible-Data-Agency_Other-Agency-Name", "value": "U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.virginia.gov", "license": "Public Domain U.S. Government"}, "permalink": "https://data.virginia.gov/d/p2ww-25u5", "link": "https://data.virginia.gov/Economy/Virginia-Employment-Status-of-the-Population-by-Se/p2ww-25u5", "owner": {"id": "kqqj-wum6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Beverly Quinlan"}, "creator": {"id": "kqqj-wum6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Beverly Quinlan"}}

{"resource": {"name": "Colonization Records", "id": "t4nd-rm7w", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Colonization records include documents from two government agencies that raised money and support for the removal of formerly enslaved people to Liberia. As early as 1691, the Virginia General Assembly began passing laws that forced free Black Virginians to leave the Commonwealth. Fears around insurrection and the desire to control the Black population gave rise to institutions dedicated to removing free people of color from Virginia. \n \nThe General Assembly passed an act in 1833 \"making appropriations for the removal of free persons of color\" to the western coast of Africa and established a board of commissioners charged with carrying out the provisions of the act. \u201cThe Board of Commissioners for the Removal of Free Persons of Color records, 1833-1856,\u201d contain correspondence, lists, minutes, oaths, and resolutions. Included are lists of free Black individuals who emigrated to Liberia (including the name of the ship), lists of free Black individuals willing to emigrate, and resolutions to send money to the American Colonization Society and to those who transported the free Black people to Liberia. Also included is a report of the Board of Commissioners, 1835, containing a list of free Black people transported to Liberia and including their names, ages, and where they had lived in Virginia.\n \nThe General Assembly passed an act on April 6, 1853 to create the Colonization Board of Virginia, (chap. 55, p. 58). This act also created appropriations to fund the voluntary transportation and removal of free Black individuals to Liberia or elsewhere in West Africa through the efforts of the Virginia branch of the American Colonization Society. Statutory members of the board included the Secretary of the Commonwealth, the Auditor of Public Accounts, the Second Auditor of Public Accounts, and four other competent members appointed by the Governor. An annual tax was levied on free Black men between the ages of 21 to 55 to help finance the operations of the board. The Colonization Board was authorized to reimburse the agents of the Virginia Colonization Society for transportation costs only after receiving satisfactory proof that the formerly enslaved individuals had been transported out of the state. The Virginia Colonization Society arranged for the actual passage of free Black individuals, and at each meeting the Board received affidavits for particular free people who had already been transported, along with evidence that the individuals were free or born of free parents, that they were residents of Virginia and that they had already been transported to Africa or that they had embarked to another state for transportation. The Board was required to keep a journal of its proceedings, showing all actions taken and monies disbursed, and was also required to submit a biennial report to the General Assembly showing the name, age, sex, and locality of each person removed. The board held its last meeting on August 14, 1858, after the preceding session of the General Assembly failed to extend its existence. The Virginia Board of Colonization journal of proceedings includes lists of the names and ages of free Black individuals transported from the commonwealth to Africa, as well as the county, city, or borough from which they were transported, and in some instances also includes the name of the ship and names of former enslavers.\n\n\nData in this collection is drawn directly from the original historical records and may contain terminology which is now deemed offensive.", "attribution": "Library of Virginia", "attribution_link": "https://virginiamemory.com/collections/aan/", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-05-24T15:54:43.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-01-29T14:10:03.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-05-24T15:54:41.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-05-24T15:54:43.000Z", "columns_name": ["Date Ship Sailed", "Name of Ship", "Method of Emancipation", "Name of Spouse", "Previous Enslaver", "First Name", "Suffix", "Gender", "Name of Children", "Name of Parents", "Date Added or Updated", "Alias", "Age", "Town", "Barcode", "Occupation", "Destination", "File Name", "Date (of entry)", "Middle Name", "Surname", "County/City"], "columns_field_name": ["date_ship_sailed", "name_of_ship", "method_of_emancipation", "name_of_spouse", "previous_enslaver", "first_name", "suffix", "gender", "name_of_children", "name_of_parents", "date_added", "alias", "age", "town", "barcode", "occupation", "destination", "file_name", "date_of_entry", "middle_name", "surname", "county_city"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Date ship sailed", "Name of ship emigrating individual traveled on", "Method of gaining freedom if emigrating individual was formerly enslaved", "Name of emigrating individual's spouse if applicable", "If applicable, name of previous enslaver of emigrating individual", "First name of the individual emigrating ", "Suffix of the individual emigrating", "Recorded gender of the emigrating individual", "Name of emigrating individual's children if applicable", "Name of emigrating individual's parents", "The date the data was added to the spreadsheet or the date it was last updated.", "Any aliases or nicknames of the emigrating individual", "Recorded age of the emigrating individual", "Town in Virginia that emigrating individual last lived before emigration", "Barcode for the box housing the original physical document referenced", "Occupation of emigrating individual", "Destination of the emigrating individual", "File name for the digital version of the document referenced", "Date that the information was recorded ", "Middle name of the individual emigrating", "Last name of the individual emigating", "County/City in Virginia that emigrating individual last lived before emigration"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-01-21T17:16:17.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["transportation", "demographics", "economy"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Education", "domain_tags": ["colonization", "emigration", "liberia", "library of virginia (lva)", "virginia untold"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Governance_Update-Cadence", "value": "Ad Hoc"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.virginia.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.virginia.gov/d/t4nd-rm7w", "link": "https://data.virginia.gov/Education/Colonization-Records/t4nd-rm7w", "owner": {"id": "6bst-yki8", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Jessi Bennett"}, "creator": {"id": "6bst-yki8", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Jessi Bennett"}}

The collection also includes records with information related to enslaved people from multiple localities who escaped to United States military forces during the Civil War. While many independent businesses bought and sold human beings, local and state governments such as the state of Virginia also participated in and profited from human trafficking. Localities were reimbursed for the expenses of confining, feeding, and selling of self-emancipated people, and likewise, the state established procedures to compensate enslavers for their financial loss when enslaved people ran away or were imprisoned or executed. If a person was captured and their enslaver could not be identified, they became the property of the state and were sold. The proceeds from these sales went to the state treasury, and often, records of those sales can be found in the Public Claims records from the Auditor of Public Accounts.

The coroner would summon a jury of twelve white men, usually prominent citizens of that locality, to assist him in determining cause of death. The jury viewed the body of the deceased and heard the testimony of witnesses which did include both white and Black perspectives. This witness testimony was recorded and after seeing and hearing the evidence, a white jury delivered in writing to the coroner their conclusion concerning cause of death referred to as the inquisition. These causes of death would be determined by a white perspective and Black individuals were only consulted; they were never in a position to make decisions. If a criminal act was determined to be the cause of death, the coroner delivered the guilty person to the sheriff and the inquests would be used as evidence in the criminal trial. In this case, coroner\u2019s inquisitions were filed with the trial papers. See Commonwealth Causes for more. If there was not a trial, coroner\u2019s inquisitions were filed separately and will likely appear in this collection as a stand alone set of documents.\n\nDocuments commonly found in coroner\u2019s inquisitions include the inquisition, depositions, and summons. Information found in the inquisition include the name of the coroner, the names of the jurors, the name and age of the deceased if known, gender and race of the deceased, and when, how, and by what means the deceased came to his or her death. If the coroner knew the deceased person to be Black or multiracial, the inquest should identify the person as enslaved; a \u201cfree Negro\u201d; a \u201cperson of color\u201d; or a \u201cmulatto.\u201d If the coroner knew the deceased person to be enslaved, the inquest should include their name, their enslaver and the enslaver\u2019s residence. Information found in the depositions include the name of the deponent and his or her account of the circumstances that led to the death of the deceased. Unlike many other legal proceedings in antebellum Virginia, enslaved people were permitted to provide depositions for coroners\u2019 inquisitions.\n\nThis data is subset focusing on records where African Americans were named either as the deceased or persons of interest involved in the inquest and is a by-product of indexing done for the Virginia Untold: African American Narrative digital collection.\n\nSome data in this collection is drawn directly from the original historical records (see column descriptions) and may contain terminology which is now deemed offensive.", "attribution": "Library of Virginia", "attribution_link": "https://virginiamemory.com/collections/aan/", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-11-28T16:05:00.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-09-14T17:46:00.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-11-28T16:04:58.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-11-28T16:05:00.000Z", "columns_name": ["Additional Enslaved Persons' Names", "Standardized Cause of Death ", "Additional Free Black Persons' Names", "Locality", "Date", "Surname", "First Name", "Date Added or Updated", "Status", "Source", "Enslaver's First Name", "Suffix", "Narrative Cause of Death", "Enslaver's Surname", "Gender", "Age", "Middle Name", "File Name", "Barcode"], "columns_field_name": ["additional_slave_names", "cause_of_death_1", "additional_free_black_names", "locality", "date", "surname", "first_name", "date_added", "status", "source", "owner_first_name", "suffix", "cause_of_death", "owner_surname", "gender", "age", "middle_name", "file_name", "barcode"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Names of enslaved persons mentioned in the record in addition to the deceased individual", "Library of Virginia normalized classification for the cause of death", "Names of Free Black persons mentioned in the record in addition to the deceased individual", "County in Virginia where the individual died", "Date of death of deceased individual", "Surname of deceased individual", "First name of deceased individual", "The date the data was added to the spreadsheet or the date it was last updated.", "Whether the deceased individual was enslaved or free as stated in the original document.
