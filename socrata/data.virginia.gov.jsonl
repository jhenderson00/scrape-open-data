Census tracts are subdivisions of counties for which the Census collects statistical data. SVI ranks the tracts on 15 social factors, including unemployment, minority status, and disability, and further groups them into four related themes. Thus, each tract receives a ranking for each Census variable and for each of the four themes, as well as an overall ranking.\"\n\nFor more see

There are a total of 10 trail counters along the Trail that collect total number of users in each section per day. We can use this data for a number of reasons such as: finding our most popular access point, the busiest times on the Trail, and the distribution of cyclist vs. pedestrian Trail users. Thanks to this technology we're able to showcase just how many people use and enjoy the Trail every day. Not just that, we share our data with other interest groups to help advocate for more trails!", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-05-22T14:53:35.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-09-29T22:36:53.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-05-22T14:53:35.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2020-09-29T22:43:09.000Z", "columns_name": ["Counters", "New Georeferenced Column", "Latitude", "longitude"], "columns_field_name": ["counters", "geocoded_column", "latitude", "longitude"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Point", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-09-29T22:41:04.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "infrastructure", "environment"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Datathon 2020", "domain_tags": ["recreation"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.virginia.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.virginia.gov/d/yv9b-k8uu", "link": "https://data.virginia.gov/Datathon-2020/Capital-Trail-Counters-geolocation/yv9b-k8uu", "owner": {"id": "teky-37e6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Shwetha Tadimalla"}, "creator": {"id": "teky-37e6", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Shwetha Tadimalla"}}
