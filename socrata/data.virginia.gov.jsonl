The collection also includes records with information related to enslaved people from multiple localities who escaped to United States military forces during the Civil War. While many independent businesses bought and sold human beings, local and state governments such as the state of Virginia also participated in and profited from human trafficking. Localities were reimbursed for the expenses of confining, feeding, and selling of self-emancipated people, and likewise, the state established procedures to compensate enslavers for their financial loss when enslaved people ran away or were imprisoned or executed. If a person was captured and their enslaver could not be identified, they became the property of the state and were sold. The proceeds from these sales went to the state treasury, and often, records of those sales can be found in the Public Claims records from the Auditor of Public Accounts. The net proceeds were deposited into the Commonwealth of Virginia\u2019s Literary Fund for the public education of poor white children.\n\nThe data in this collection is drawn directly from the historical documents and may contain language that is now deemed offensive.", "attribution": "Library of Virginia", "attribution_link": "https://virginiamemory.com/collections/aan/", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-11-17T19:42:09.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-02-05T16:34:22.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-11-17T19:42:09.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-01-21T18:20:48.000Z", "columns_name": ["Date Added or Updated", "Occupation", "Gender", "Middle Name", "Age", "Locality", "File Name", "Child(ren)", "Alias", "Enslaver", "Source", "Date", "First Name", "Barcode", "District of", "Surname", "Place of Imprisonment", "Date of escape", "New Enslaver", "Suffix"], "columns_field_name": ["date_added", "occupation", "gender", "middle_name", "age", "locality", "file_name", "children", "alias", "enslaver", "source", "date", "first_name", "barcode", "district_of", "surname", "place_of_imprisonment", "date_of_escape", "new_enslaver", "suffix"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["The date the data was added to the spreadsheet or the date it was last updated.", "Profession, craft or trade of enslaved individual", "Recorded gender of enslaved individual", "Middle name of enslaved individual", "Recorded age of enslaved individual", "City/County in Virginia where recorded", "File identification of digital copy", "Child(ren) of enslaved individual", "Any aliases or nicknames of enslaved individual", "Enslaver that individual self-emancipated from", "Archival source of the original document", "Date recorded", "First name of enslaved individual", "Barcode identifier for the box housing the original document", "Jurisdiction under which the  enslaved individual was held", "Last name of enslaved individual", "Place where enslaved individual was held when captured", "Date the individual  self-emancipated", "Current enslaver", "Suffix of enslaved individual"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-01-21T18:20:54.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["economy", "finance", "demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Education", "domain_tags": ["antebellum", "library of virginia (lva)", "slavery", "virginia untold"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.virginia.gov", "license": "Public Domain"}, "permalink": "https://data.virginia.gov/d/vbqa-smsu", "link": "https://data.virginia.gov/Education/-Runaway-Slave-Records/vbqa-smsu", "owner": {"id": "6bst-yki8", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Jessi Bennett"}, "creator": {"id": "6bst-yki8", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Jessi Bennett"}}

The coroner would summon a jury of twelve white men, usually prominent citizens of that locality, to assist him in determining cause of death. The jury viewed the body of the deceased and heard the testimony of witnesses which did include both white and Black perspectives. This witness testimony was recorded and after seeing and hearing the evidence, a white jury delivered in writing to the coroner their conclusion concerning cause of death referred to as the inquisition. These causes of death would be determined by a white perspective and Black individuals were only consulted; they were never in a position to make decisions. If a criminal act was determined to be the cause of death, the coroner delivered the guilty person to the sheriff and the inquests would be used as evidence in the criminal trial. In this case, coroner\u2019s inquisitions were filed with the trial papers. See Commonwealth Causes for more. If there was not a trial, coroner\u2019s inquisitions were filed separately and will likely appear in this collection as a stand alone set of documents.\n\nDocuments commonly found in coroner\u2019s inquisitions include the inquisition, depositions, and summons. Information found in the inquisition include the name of the coroner, the names of the jurors, the name and age of the deceased if known, gender and race of the deceased, and when, how, and by what means the deceased came to his or her death. If the coroner knew the deceased person to be Black or multiracial, the inquest should identify the person as enslaved; a \u201cfree Negro\u201d; a \u201cperson of color\u201d; or a \u201cmulatto.\u201d If the coroner knew the deceased person to be enslaved, the inquest should include their name, their enslaver and the enslaver\u2019s residence. Information found in the depositions include the name of the deponent and his or her account of the circumstances that led to the death of the deceased. Unlike many other legal proceedings in antebellum Virginia, enslaved people were permitted to provide depositions for coroners\u2019 inquisitions.\n\nThis data is subset focusing on records where African Americans were named either as the deceased or persons of interest involved in the inquest and is a by-product of indexing done for the Virginia Untold: African American Narrative digital collection.\n\nSome data in this collection is drawn directly from the original historical records (see column descriptions) and may contain terminology which is now deemed offensive.", "attribution": "Library of Virginia", "attribution_link": "https://virginiamemory.com/collections/aan/", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-11-28T16:05:00.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-09-14T17:46:00.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-11-28T16:04:58.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-11-28T16:05:00.000Z", "columns_name": ["Standardized Cause of Death ", "Date Added or Updated", "First Name", "Surname", "Date", "Additional Enslaved Persons' Names", "Narrative Cause of Death", "Enslaver's Surname", "Gender", "Age", "Middle Name", "File Name", "Barcode", "Locality", "Additional Free Black Persons' Names", "Suffix", "Enslaver's First Name", "Source", "Status"], "columns_field_name": ["cause_of_death_1", "date_added", "first_name", "surname", "date", "additional_slave_names", "cause_of_death", "owner_surname", "gender", "age", "middle_name", "file_name", "barcode", "locality", "additional_free_black_names", "suffix", "owner_first_name", "source", "status"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Library of Virginia normalized classification for the cause of death", "The date the data was added to the spreadsheet or the date it was last updated.", "First name of deceased individual", "Surname of deceased individual", "Date of death of deceased individual", "Names of enslaved persons mentioned in the record in addition to the deceased individual", "Detailed cause of death summarized from the original record", "If enslaved, the surname of the enslaver of the deceased individual", "Gender of deceased individual as noted in original document", "Age, sometimes approximated, of deceased individual as noted in original document", "Middle name of deceased individual", "File name for the digital version of the document referenced", "Barcode for the box housing the original physical document referenced", "County in Virginia where the individual died", "Names of Free Black persons mentioned in the record in addition to the deceased individual", "Suffix to the name of the deceased individual", "If enslaved, the first name of the enslaver of the deceased individual", "Collection information for the original record", "Whether the deceased individual was enslaved or free as stated in the original document.

Census tracts are subdivisions of counties for which the Census collects statistical data. SVI ranks the tracts on 15 social factors, including unemployment, minority status, and disability, and further groups them into four related themes.
