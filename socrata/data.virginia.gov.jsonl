The coroner would summon a jury of twelve white men, usually prominent citizens of that locality, to assist him in determining cause of death. The jury viewed the body of the deceased and heard the testimony of witnesses which did include both white and Black perspectives. This witness testimony was recorded and after seeing and hearing the evidence, a white jury delivered in writing to the coroner their conclusion concerning cause of death referred to as the inquisition. These causes of death would be determined by a white perspective and Black individuals were only consulted; they were never in a position to make decisions. If a criminal act was determined to be the cause of death, the coroner delivered the guilty person to the sheriff and the inquests would be used as evidence in the criminal trial. In this case, coroner\u2019s inquisitions were filed with the trial papers. See Commonwealth Causes for more. If there was not a trial, coroner\u2019s inquisitions were filed separately and will likely appear in this collection as a stand alone set of documents.\n\nDocuments commonly found in coroner\u2019s inquisitions include the inquisition, depositions, and summons. Information found in the inquisition include the name of the coroner, the names of the jurors, the name and age of the deceased if known, gender and race of the deceased, and when, how, and by what means the deceased came to his or her death. If the coroner knew the deceased person to be Black or multiracial, the inquest should identify the person as enslaved; a \u201cfree Negro\u201d; a \u201cperson of color\u201d; or a \u201cmulatto.\u201d If the coroner knew the deceased person to be enslaved, the inquest should include their name, their enslaver and the enslaver\u2019s residence. Information found in the depositions include the name of the deponent and his or her account of the circumstances that led to the death of the deceased. Unlike many other legal proceedings in antebellum Virginia, enslaved people were permitted to provide depositions for coroners\u2019 inquisitions.\n\nThis data is subset focusing on records where African Americans were named either as the deceased or persons of interest involved in the inquest and is a by-product of indexing done for the Virginia Untold: African American Narrative digital collection.\n\nSome data in this collection is drawn directly from the original historical records (see column descriptions) and may contain terminology which is now deemed offensive.", "attribution": "Library of Virginia", "attribution_link": "https://virginiamemory.com/collections/aan/", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-11-28T16:05:00.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-09-14T17:46:00.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-11-28T16:04:58.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-11-28T16:05:00.000Z", "columns_name": ["Suffix", "Standardized Cause of Death ", "Date", "Surname", "First Name", "Date Added or Updated", "Status", "Source", "Enslaver's First Name", "Additional Enslaved Persons' Names", "Enslaver's Surname", "Narrative Cause of Death", "Age", "Middle Name", "File Name", "Barcode", "Locality", "Additional Free Black Persons' Names", "Gender"], "columns_field_name": ["suffix", "cause_of_death_1", "date", "surname", "first_name", "date_added", "status", "source", "owner_first_name", "additional_slave_names", "owner_surname", "cause_of_death", "age", "middle_name", "file_name", "barcode", "locality", "additional_free_black_names", "gender"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Suffix to the name of the deceased individual", "Library of Virginia normalized classification for the cause of death", "Date of death of deceased individual", "Surname of deceased individual", "First name of deceased individual", "The date the data was added to the spreadsheet or the date it was last updated.", "Whether the deceased individual was enslaved or free as stated in the original document.

Census tracts are subdivisions of counties for which the Census collects statistical data. SVI ranks the tracts on 15 social factors, including unemployment, minority status, and disability, and further groups them into four related themes. Thus, each tract receives a ranking for each Census variable and for each of the four themes, as well as an overall ranking.\"\n\nFor more see
