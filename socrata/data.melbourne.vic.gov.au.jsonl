These sensors record when a vehicle arrives and when it departs. Each record also includes the parking restriction for the bay and whether the vehicle has overstayed that restriction. This is the data for the 2014 calendar year.\r\n\r\nKnown data issues: \r\n\r\n1. There are 1,126,441 records that have the text \u2018OLD\u2019 at the end of the restriction in the field named \u2018Sign\u2019. This has been investigated and determined the text refers to one of two things, either:  \r\n\r\n\u00b7 At the time of the parking event the restriction that has been captured is correct but when the data was extracted from the server (July 2017) the restriction had since changed.  \r\n\r\n\u00b7 (Or) The particular sensor has since been replaced. \r\n\r\n2. There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field \u2018seconds\u2019. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. \r\n\r\n3. There are a number of records where the arrival and departure times have not been recorded. If the time has not been recorded the time is calculated from midnight of the arrival day to either midnight of the departure day or to the departure time. \r\n\r\nData that is excluded: \r\n\r\nIn the 2014 car parking event data there are 3,377 records where the parking event goes into 2015 and ends at midnight.", "attribution": "City of Melbourne", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-11-19T22:18:26.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-12-20T14:28:27.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-11-19T22:18:26.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-04-16T11:26:16.000Z", "columns_name": ["Vehicle Present", "BetweenStreet2", "DepartureTime", "ArrivalTime", "DeviceId", "In Violation", "DurationSeconds", "Side Of Street", "BetweenStreet1", "StreetId", "Area", "Sign", "StreetName", "StreetMarker"], "columns_field_name": ["vehicle_present", "betweenstreet2", "departuretime", "arrivaltime", "deviceid", "in_violation", "durationseconds", "side_of_street", "betweenstreet1", "streetid", "area", "sign", "streetname", "streetmarker"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["True = Vehicle present False = Vehicle not present", "Closest Intersecting street with the street parked on.

There are a number of records that have a negative value in the duration in field \u2018seconds\u2019. This occurs due to a sensor detecting an arrival time being after the departure time. \r\n\r\n3.
