For the purposes of this dataset, active status indicates dealers authorized to handle tobacco products subject to Pennsylvania tax.\nThis list is intended to be refreshed monthly, removing the licenses that are cancelled or expire without renewal, and adding new licenses once they are approved.  The addresses provided are supposed to be the physical location where the taxable sales happen or taxable service provided.  The DOR generally does not validate the location address, so there may be misspelled items.\nTobacco products licenses must be conspicuously displayed at the location issued.\nIn order to reduce fraud, a portion of the license number was masked. If you suspect someone is selling unstamped cigarettes, or selling tobacco products without a license in Pennsylvania, use this link to Report Tax Fraud.  Tips can be left anonymously, but supporting documentation is helpful.\nMore information about the tobacco products tax: PA Code, Article III Cigarette and Beverage Taxes.\nPA Department of Revenue website: https://www.revenue.pa.gov.  \nCommon questions:\n\u2022\tWhy are there out of state/out of country licenses?  Tobacco products tax requires licensing at all levels before shipping to PA wholesalers and retailers.  Some stampers, manufacturers or wholesalers maintain product outside PA and ship to PA retailers or wholesalers.  The license should be the location the product is stored. \n\u2022\tWhat is \u201cOther Tobacco Products\u201d (OTP)? The cigarette tax law was amended in 2016 to include electronic cigarettes and related liquid (commonly referred to as vaping), roll-your-own tobacco (loose tobacco that can be used to make cigarettes), snuff, pipe tobacco, and other tobacco products used for chewing, ingesting or smoking.  More information is available from Revenue\u2019s web site.\n\u2022\tDoes this list contain every tobacco product retailer?  It should.  In order to sell product legally in PA, a retailer must be licensed.

{"resource": {"name": "Newly Identified Confirmed Chronic Hepatitis C Age 15-34 Year 2007-2016 Health", "id": "xsm2-kreq", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This data set provides an estimate of the number of people aged 15-34 years with newly identified confirmed chronic (or past/present) hepatitis C infection, by county and by year.  \r\nThe dataset is limited to persons aged 15 to 34 because hepatitis C infection is usually asymptomatic for decades after infection occurs.  Cases are usually identified because they have finally become symptomatic, or they were screened.  Until very recently, screening for hepatitis C was not routinely performed.  This makes it very challenging to identify persons with recent infection.  Limiting the age of newly identified patients to 15-34 years makes it more likely that the cases included in the dashboard were infected fairly recently.  It is not meant to imply that the opioid crisis\u2019 effect on hepatitis C transmission is limited to younger people.  \r\nThe process by which case counts are determined is as follows:  Case reports, which include lab test results and address data, are sent to Pennsylvania\u2019s electronic disease surveillance system (PA-NEDSS).  Confirmation status is determined by public health investigators who evaluate test results against the CDC case definition for hepatitis C in place for the year in which the patient was first reported (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/hepatitis-c-chronic/).  Reportable disease data, including hepatitis C, is extracted from PA-NEDSS, combined with similar data sent by the Philadelphia Department of Public Health (PDPH, which uses a separate surveillance system), and sent to CDC.  Case data sent to CDC (from PA-NEDSS and PDPH combined) are used to create a statewide reportable disease dataset.  This statewide file was used to generate the dashboard dataset.    \r\nNote that the term that CDC has used to denote persons with hepatitis C infection that is not known to be acute has switched back and forth between \u201cHepatitis C, past or present\u201d and \u201cHepatitis C, chronic\u201d over the past several years.  The CDC case definition for hepatitis C, chronic (or past or present) changed in 2005, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2016.  Persons reported as confirmed in one year may not have been considered confirmed in another year.  For example, patients with a positive radioimmunoblot assay (RIBA) or elevated enzyme immunoassay (EIA) signal-to-cutoff level were counted as confirmed in 2012, but not counted as confirmed in 2016.  \r\nData sent to CDC\u2019s National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System use a measure for aggregating cases by year called the MMWR year.  The MMWR, or the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, is an official publication by CDC and the means by which CDC has historically presented aggregated case count data.  Since data in the MMWR are presented by week, the MMWR year always starts on the Sunday closest to Jan 1 and ends on the Saturday closest to Dec 31.  The most recent year for which case counts are finalized is 2016.  Annual case counts are finalized in May of the following year.  \r\nThe patient zip code, as submitted to PA-NEDSS, is used to determine the case\u2019s county of residence at the time of initial case report.  In some instances, the patient zip code is unavailable.  In those circumstances, the zip code of the provider that ordered the lab test is used as a proxy for patient zip code.    \r\nUsers should note that the state prison system routinely screens all incoming inmates for hepatitis C.  If these inmates are determined to be confirmed cases, they are assigned to the county in which they were incarcerated when their confirmed hepatitis C was first identified.  Hepatitis C case counts in counties with state prisons should be interpreted cautiously in light of this enhanced screening activity.", "attribution": "Department of Health", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-10-17T20:05:23.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-02-16T18:41:12.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-10-17T20:05:23.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2018-06-05T13:13:41.000Z", "columns_name": ["Latitude/Longitude (address)", "Latitude/Longitude (city)", "Hepatitis C counts", "County Code", "Municipality Boundary", "Latitude/Longitude", "Latitude/Longitude (zip)", "County Name", "State FIPS Code", "Hepatitis Count Description", "Latitude/Longitude (state)", "County FIPS Code", "County Code Number", "Year", "Pa Senatorial Districts (2017-01)", "Pennsylvania County Boundaries", "Pa House Districts (2017-01)", "Pa School Districts (2017)"], "columns_field_name": ["location_1_address", "location_1_city", "hcvcounts", "county_code", ":@computed_region_amqz_jbr4", "location_1", "location_1_zip", "county_name", "state_fips_code", "hepatitis_count_description", "location_1_state", "county_fips_code", "county_code_number", "year", ":@computed_region_d3gw_znnf", ":@computed_region_nmsq_hqvv", ":@computed_region_r6rf_p9et", ":@computed_region_rayf_jjgk"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Point", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "Number of newly identified confirmed cases of hepatitis C (past or present, or chronic) in persons aged 15-34 in the specified county and year.

In cooperation with DHS this website excludes waste lines from the manifest, including the quantity, that contain COI. This website also excludes the manifest's shipped and received dates for manifests containing COI. These exclusions should be taken into account when using this data.", "attribution": "Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-03-28T22:12:16.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-12-07T15:02:44.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-03-28T22:10:05.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-03-28T22:12:16.000Z", "columns_name": ["ADDITIONAL HANDLING INSTRUCTIONS", "ADDITIONAL ELECTRONIC SIGN DESCRIPTION", "CONTAINER NUMBER", "NON-DOT WASTE DESCRIPTION", "CONTAINER TYPE DESCRIPTION", "WASTE QUANTITY", "RESIDUE INDICATOR", "WASTE CODE", "EPA WASTE INDICATOR", "REJECTED ALTERNATE DESIGNATED SITE ID", "CORRECTION VERSION NUMBER", "CORRECTION PPC ACTIVE INDICATOR", "CORRECTION ACTIVE INDICATOR", "REJECTED ALTERNATE DESIGNATED FACILITY TYPE", "WASTE TYPE", "WASTE MINIMIZATION CODE", "WASTE TYPE DESCRIPTION", "DOT HAZARDOUS INDICATOR", "ORIGIN TYPE", "SIGNATURE STATUS INDICATOR", "CORRECTION EPA SITE ID", "REJECT COMMENTS", "REJECTION TYPE", "ADDITIONAL HANDLER IDENTIFIER", "SITE NAME", "EPA SITE IDENTIFIER", "DATE CERTIFIED", "DATE RECEIVED", "DATE SHIPPED", "SUBMISSION TYPE", "TRACKING NUMBER", "DATE UPDATED", "DISCREPANCY COMMENTS", "ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONSENT NUMBER", "DATE CREATED", "WASTE QUANITITY INDICATOR", "BR INFORMATION DENSITY", "PCB INFORMATION EXISTS", "FORM DESCRIPTION", "BR INFORMATION UNIT OF MEASURE DESCRIPTION", "BR INFORMATION EXISTS", "CONTAINER TYPE CODE", "SITE TYPE CODE IDENTIFIER", "WASTE TYPE CODE", "WASTE DESCRIPTION", "MANAGEMENT METHOD CODE", "MANAGEMENT METHOD DESCRIPTION", "BR INFORMATION UNT OF MEASURE CODE", "FORM CODE", "DOT CODE", "SOURCE CODE", "SOURCE DESCRIPTION", "WASTE MINIMIZATION DESCRIPTION", "WASTE LINE NUMBER", "ADDITIONAL ELECTRONIC SIGN LABEL", "RESIDUE COMMENTS", "WASTE UNIT OF MEASUREMENT CODE", "DOT DESCRIPTION", "WASTE UNITS OF MEASUREMENT DESCRIPTION", "STATUS"], "columns_field_name": ["addl_handling_instructions", "addl_electronic_sign_desc", "container_number", "non_dot_waste_desc", "container_type_desc", "waste_quantity", "residue_ind", "waste_code", "epa_waste_ind", "rej_alt_designated_site_id", "correction_version_number", "correction_ppc_active_ind", "correction_active_ind", "rej_alt_designated_fac_type", "waste_type", "waste_minimization_code", "waste_type_description", "dot_hazardous_ind", "origin_type", "signature_status_ind", "correction_epa_site_id", "reject_comments", "rejection_type", "addl_handler_id", "site_name", "epa_site_id", "date_certified", "date_received", "date_shipped", "submission_type", "tracking_number", "date_updated", "discrepancy_comments", "addl_info_consent_number", "date_created", "waste_quanitity_ind", "brinfo_density", "pcb_info_exists", "form_description", "brinfo_uom_desc", "br_info_exists", "container_type_code", "site_type_code_id", "waste_type_code", "waste_description", "management_method_code", "management_method_desc", "brinfo_uom_code", "form_code", "dot_code", "source_code", "source_description", "waste_minimization_desc", "waste_line_number", "addl_electronic_sign_label", "residue_comments", "waste_uom_code", "dot_desc", "waste_uom_desc", "status"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Checkbox", "Text", "Checkbox", "Text", "Number", "Checkbox", "Checkbox", "Text", "Checkbox", "Text", "Text", "Checkbox", "Text", "Checkbox", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Checkbox", "Number", "Checkbox", "Text", "Text", "Checkbox", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Special handling instructions.", "Data for the reference information described by the label.", "Number of Containers this waste line occupies.", "A description of the Non-DOT regulated waste.", "A description of the container the waste was transported in.
