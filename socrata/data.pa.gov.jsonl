{"resource": {"name": "Sales, Use & Hotel Occupancy Tax Licenses and Certificates Current Monthly County Revenue", "id": "ugeq-ckxd", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This dataset contains the list of sales tax licenses, exemption and wholesaler certificates as maintained by the Department of Revenue (DOR) that are active.  For the purposes of this dataset, active status indicates vendors that currently have filing requirements with DOR, as well as valid exemption and wholesaler certificates.\r\nThis list is intended to be refreshed monthly, removing the licenses that are cancelled or expire without renewal, and adding new licenses once they are approved.  The addresses provided are supposed to be the physical location where the taxable sales happen or taxable service provided.  The DOR generally does not validate the location address, so there may be misspelled items.\r\nSales, use and hotel occupancy tax licenses must be prominently displayed at the place of business, at each location, photocopies are acceptable.  This list also contains exempt organizations that have a current valid exemption number issued by the Department.  Exemption numbers must be provided on exemption certificates when purchasing items or services that would be otherwise taxable. \r\nFor the taxpayer\u2019s convenience, the Department of Revenue allows taxpayers to either report each location\u2019s sales under a unique license number, or consolidate the entire entity\u2019s sales under a single license number.  For that reason, you may see some large chains appear to have only one license, where others have multiple licenses.  Similarly, you will find licenses/certificates with out of state addresses provided by the applicant.\r\nIn order to reduce fraud, a portion of the license number / exemption certificate number was masked. If you suspect someone is selling taxable items, providing a taxable service or otherwise not remitting sales tax, use this link to Report Tax Fraud.  Tips can be left anonymously, but supporting documentation is helpful.\r\nMore information about licenses & certificates: PA Code, Article II Sales & Use Tax.\r\nPA Department of Revenue website: https://www.revenue.pa.gov.  \r\nCommon questions:\r\n\u2022\tWhy are there out of state/out of country licenses?  We allow taxpayers to photocopy licenses, so taxpayers could keep the original license where their records are kept, and post a copy in each PA location.  Another reason would be mail order or delivery-based companies.  These companies do not maintain a PA address, but could ship to PA or travel into PA to deliver their taxable product or perform their taxable service. \r\n\u2022\tDoes this list contain every volunteer fire company in PA?  Only if the volunteer fire company applied for an exemption certificate to purchase items without paying sales tax.  An exempt entity that does not hold an exemption certificate could pay the sales tax on the purchase, then file a petition for refund on the tax paid.\r\n\u2022\tWhat is a \u201ctransient vendor\u201d?  In general, someone who temporarily brings taxable items into PA for retail sale, but does not maintain a location.  For a more detailed definition, see the PA Code link above.\r\n\u2022\tWhat is a \u201cwholesaler certificate\u201d?  A wholesale certificate allows sales of otherwise taxable items at the wholesale level; they are not permitted to sell anything at retail.  The tax will be collected when the item is sold at retail.

Cases are usually identified because they have finally become symptomatic, or they were screened.  Until very recently, screening for hepatitis C was not routinely performed.  This makes it very challenging to identify persons with recent infection.  Limiting the age of newly identified patients to 15-34 years makes it more likely that the cases included in the dashboard were infected fairly recently.  It is not meant to imply that the opioid crisis\u2019 effect on hepatitis C transmission is limited to younger people.  \r\nThe process by which case counts are determined is as follows:  Case reports, which include lab test results and address data, are sent to Pennsylvania\u2019s electronic disease surveillance system (PA-NEDSS).  Confirmation status is determined by public health investigators who evaluate test results against the CDC case definition for hepatitis C in place for the year in which the patient was first reported (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/hepatitis-c-chronic/).  Reportable disease data, including hepatitis C, is extracted from PA-NEDSS, combined with similar data sent by the Philadelphia Department of Public Health (PDPH, which uses a separate surveillance system), and sent to CDC.  Case data sent to CDC (from PA-NEDSS and PDPH combined) are used to create a statewide reportable disease dataset.  This statewide file was used to generate the dashboard dataset.    \r\nNote that the term that CDC has used to denote persons with hepatitis C infection that is not known to be acute has switched back and forth between \u201cHepatitis C, past or present\u201d and \u201cHepatitis C, chronic\u201d over the past several years.  The CDC case definition for hepatitis C, chronic (or past or present) changed in 2005, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2016.  Persons reported as confirmed in one year may not have been considered confirmed in another year.  For example, patients with a positive radioimmunoblot assay (RIBA) or elevated enzyme immunoassay (EIA) signal-to-cutoff level were counted as confirmed in 2012, but not counted as confirmed in 2016.  \r\nData sent to CDC\u2019s National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System use a measure for aggregating cases by year called the MMWR year.  The MMWR, or the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, is an official publication by CDC and the means by which CDC has historically presented aggregated case count data.  Since data in the MMWR are presented by week, the MMWR year always starts on the Sunday closest to Jan 1 and ends on the Saturday closest to Dec 31.  The most recent year for which case counts are finalized is 2016.  Annual case counts are finalized in May of the following year.  \r\nThe patient zip code, as submitted to PA-NEDSS, is used to determine the case\u2019s county of residence at the time of initial case report.  In some instances, the patient zip code is unavailable.  In those circumstances, the zip code of the provider that ordered the lab test is used as a proxy for patient zip code.    \r\nUsers should note that the state prison system routinely screens all incoming inmates for hepatitis C.  If these inmates are determined to be confirmed cases, they are assigned to the county in which they were incarcerated when their confirmed hepatitis C was first identified.  Hepatitis C case counts in counties with state prisons should be interpreted cautiously in light of this enhanced screening activity.", "attribution": "Department of Health", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-10-17T20:05:23.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-02-16T18:41:12.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-10-17T20:05:23.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2018-06-05T13:13:41.000Z", "columns_name": ["State FIPS Code", "Latitude/Longitude (address)", "Latitude/Longitude (zip)", "Municipality Boundary", "Pa School Districts (2017)", "Pa House Districts (2017-01)", "Pennsylvania County Boundaries", "Pa Senatorial Districts (2017-01)", "Year", "Hepatitis C counts", "Latitude/Longitude (city)", "County Name", "Latitude/Longitude", "County Code Number", "County FIPS Code", "County Code", "Latitude/Longitude (state)", "Hepatitis Count Description"], "columns_field_name": ["state_fips_code", "location_1_address", "location_1_zip", ":@computed_region_amqz_jbr4", ":@computed_region_rayf_jjgk", ":@computed_region_r6rf_p9et", ":@computed_region_nmsq_hqvv", ":@computed_region_d3gw_znnf", "year", "hcvcounts", "location_1_city", "county_name", "location_1", "county_code_number", "county_fips_code", "county_code", "location_1_state", "hepatitis_count_description"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Point", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["These are the first 2 digits of the 5-digit Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code that designate the State association.
