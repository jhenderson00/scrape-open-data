These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).\n\nDue to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.\n\nDetails of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:\n- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals\n- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)\n- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)\n- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)\n- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10.

Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.\r\n\r\nThings to note:\r\n\r\nDFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.\r\nDFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.\r\nDFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.\r\nDFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.", "attribution": "City of Edmonton", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-02-28T00:18:38.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-08-30T21:45:19.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-02-27T23:53:54.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-28T00:18:38.000Z", "columns_name": ["Vehicle Count at Slowest Speed Detected", "Maximum Speed for Bin Number", "Minimum Speed for Bin Number", "Log Timestamp", "Maximum Speed Detection Setting", "Row ID", "Vehicle Count for Log Interval", "Vehicle Count at Highest Speed Detected", "Bin Over Speed Limit Flag", "Site ID", "Location Description", "Minimum Speed Detection Setting", "Speed Limit", "Direction", "Speed Range for Bin", "Bin Number", "Speed Unit of Measure"], "columns_field_name": ["vehicle_count_at_slowest_speed_detected", "maximum_speed_for_bin_number", "minimum_speed_for_bin_number", "log_timestamp", "maximum_speed_detection_setting", "row_id", "vehicle_count_for_log_interval", "vehicle_count_at_highest_speed_detected", "bin_over_speed_limit_flag", "site_id", "location_description", "minimum_speed_detection_setting", "speed_limit", "direction", "speed_range_for_bin", "bin_number", "speed_unit_of_measure"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["The number of vehicles counted in the 15 minute time interval where the detected slowest speed of the vehicle was equal to or greater than the Minimum Speed for the Bin and is less than or equal to the Maximum Speed for the Bin.", "The fastest detected speed travelled that corresponds to the Bin Number.

These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).\n\nDue to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.\n\nDetails of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:\n- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals\n- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)\n- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)\n- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)\n- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.\n\nThings to note:\n\nDFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.\nDFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.\nDFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.\nDFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.", "attribution": "City of Edmonton", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-02-28T00:12:18.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-08-16T20:46:15.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-02-27T23:48:06.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-28T00:12:18.000Z", "columns_name": ["Maximum Speed for Bin Number", "Log Timestamp", "Vehicle Count at Slowest Speed Detected", "Speed Range for Bin", "Vehicle Count for Log Interval", "Row ID", "Minimum Speed for Bin Number", "Vehicle Count at Highest Speed Detected", "Bin Number", "Site ID", "Location Description", "Speed Limit", "Minimum Speed Detection Setting", "Bin Over Speed Limit Flag", "Maximum Speed Detection Setting", "Speed Unit of Measure", "Direction"], "columns_field_name": ["maximum_speed_for_bin_number", "log_timestamp", "vehicle_count_at_slowest_speed_detected", "speed_range_for_bin", "vehicle_count_for_log_interval", "row_id", "minimum_speed_for_bin_number", "vehicle_count_at_highest_speed_detected", "bin_number", "site_id", "location_description", "speed_limit", "minimum_speed_detection_setting", "bin_over_speed_limit_flag", "maximum_speed_detection_setting", "speed_unit_of_measure", "direction"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["The fastest detected speed travelled that corresponds to the Bin Number.

Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.\r\n\r\nThings to note:\r\n\r\nDFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.\r\nDFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.\r\nDFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.\r\nDFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.", "attribution": "City of Edmonton", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-02-28T00:06:18.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-08-14T10:29:06.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-02-27T23:43:04.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-28T00:06:18.000Z", "columns_name": ["Vehicle Count at Slowest Speed Detected", "Log Timestamp", "Row ID", "Bin Number", "Maximum Speed for Bin Number", "Vehicle Count for Log Interval", "Vehicle Count at Highest Speed Detected", "Bin Over Speed Limit Flag", "Direction", "Speed Unit of Measure", "Location Description", "Minimum Speed for Bin Number", "Speed Range for Bin", "Maximum Speed Detection Setting", "Minimum Speed Detection Setting", "Speed Limit", "Site ID"], "columns_field_name": ["vehicle_count_at_slowest_speed_detected", "log_timestamp", "row_id", "bin_number", "maximum_speed_for_bin_number", "vehicle_count_for_log_interval", "vehicle_count_at_highest_speed_detected", "bin_over_speed_limit_flag", "direction", "speed_unit_of_measure", "location_description", "minimum_speed_for_bin_number", "speed_range_for_bin", "maximum_speed_detection_setting", "minimum_speed_detection_setting", "speed_limit", "site_id"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["The number of vehicles counted in the 15 minute time interval where the detected slowest speed of the vehicle was equal to or greater than the Minimum Speed for the Bin and is less than or equal to the Maximum Speed for the Bin.", "The Timestamp of when the data was recorded.

Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.\r\n\r\nThings to note:\r\n\r\nDFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.\r\nDFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.\r\nDFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.\r\nDFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.", "attribution": "City of Edmonton", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-02-28T00:24:45.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-09-02T18:30:38.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-02-28T00:24:36.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-28T00:24:45.000Z", "columns_name": ["Vehicle Count at Highest Speed Detected", "Vehicle Count for Log Interval", "Row ID", "Vehicle Count at Slowest Speed Detected", "Maximum Speed for Bin Number", "Minimum Speed for Bin Number", "Speed Range for Bin", "Log Timestamp", "Direction", "Maximum Speed Detection Setting", "Bin Over Speed Limit Flag", "Speed Limit", "Location Description", "Bin Number", "Minimum Speed Detection Setting", "Speed Unit of Measure", "Site ID"], "columns_field_name": ["vehicle_count_at_highest_speed_detected", "vehicle_count_for_log_interval", "row_id", "vehicle_count_at_slowest_speed_detected", "maximum_speed_for_bin_number", "minimum_speed_for_bin_number", "speed_range_for_bin", "log_timestamp", "direction", "maximum_speed_detection_setting", "bin_over_speed_limit_flag", "speed_limit", "location_description", "bin_number", "minimum_speed_detection_setting", "speed_unit_of_measure", "site_id"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["The number of vehicles counted in the 15 minute time interval where the detected fastest speed of the vehicle was equal to or greater than the Minimum Speed for the Bin and is less than or equal to the Maximum Speed for the Bin.", "The number of vehicles that were successfully detected and recorded within the specified parameters.

These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).\n\nDue to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.\n\nDetails of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:\n- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals\n- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)\n- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)\n- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)\n- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10.

If someone notices a person sitting on a Buddy Bench, they are encouraged to sit with them and start up a conversation.\r\n\r\nThe Buddy Bench Pilot Project is part of the \u201cHello, How Are You?\u201d (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/hello-how-are-you.aspx) campaign, which encompasses two council initiatives: the Council Initiative on Urban Isolation and Mental Health (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/urban-isolation-mental-health.aspx) and the Council Initiative on Seniors (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/senior-isolation-loneliness.aspx). The campaign encourages Edmontonians to connect within their communities to help prevent social isolation. The pilot came about after a young boy approached city administration hoping to have his school\u2019s Buddy Bench concept implemented on a larger scale.

The model is based on a theoretical, worst-case scenario storm that has never occurred in the Edmonton area.\r\n\r\nModel Accuracy:\r\n\r\nFor Areas west and central Digital Elevation Model was used from 2004.  For the rest of the areas Bare Earth LiDar data was used.  The surface data used was set to a horizontal resolution of 2.5 meters with a grid cell of 5m by 5m.  This puts the vertical resolution at an accuracy of 0.1 meters. \r\n\r\nThis is a spline fit interpolations model.  This is a 1D-1D model with 2D interpolations.The accuracy of the information provided in these data sets is plus or minus 10 cm vertically, and 10 cm horizontally.   \r\n\r\nThe 100 year flood was based on the 2015 Edmonton 4 year Chicago storm event over 20 plus neighbourhoods.  The data is a collection of the worst case scenario of model runs.  \r\nThis is a common practice for Edmonton drainage models.  These models are high level concept and projects determined from this data set will undergo finer, more detailed modeling.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: No Warranty with Flood Risk Maps.\r\nYour use of the flood risk maps is solely at your own risk, and you are fully responsible for any consequences arising from your use of the flood risk maps.
