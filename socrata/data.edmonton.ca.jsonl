For the rest of the areas Bare Earth LiDar data was used.  The surface data used was set to a horizontal resolution of 2.5 meters with a grid cell of 5m by 5m.  This puts the vertical resolution at an accuracy of 0.1 meters. \r\n\r\nThis is a spline fit interpolations model.

However, the Anglo-Huron Treaty (Murray Treaty), which is part of the Treaties of Peace and Neutrality, is not represented in this dataset because it has no geographic boundary. These boundaries represent the large areas of land that the First Nations gave up to the Crown in exchange for such things as reserve lands, benefits or promises. These boundaries are usually not surveyed but help to delineate the broad area defined within the treaty. The boundaries are composed of the sum of specific geographies such as lakes, rivers, townships, mountains, administrative boundaries or height of land as mentioned in the treaties transcript. These boundaries are estimated based on written descriptions and should be used for informational and representational purposes only.\n\nThe various treaties created between the Crown and the Aboriginal people, include: the Treaties of Peace and Neutrality, the Peace and Friendship Treaties, Upper Canada Land Surrenders, the Williams Treaties, the Robinson Treaties, the Douglas Treaties and the Numbered Treaties.\n\nFor more information about Pre-1975 Treaties, visit http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1370362690208/1370362747827.\n\nThe Pre-1975 Treaties dataset is part of the Treaties and Aboriginal Agreements geospatial information.\n\nThe Treaties and Aboriginal Agreements geospatial information represent the geographic boundaries of the solemn agreements between the Crown and the Aboriginal people, and set out promises, obligations and benefits for both parties. The following datasets are also available:\n\n1) The Post-1975 Treaties (Modern Treaties) dataset represents the areas of Canada where Aboriginal land rights and title have not been addressed by treaty or through other legal means.\n\n2) The Aboriginal Agreements dataset represents established consultation processes and the Aboriginal groups that govern their internal affairs and assume greater responsibility and control over the decision making that affects their communities.\n\nData-sharing agreements with the INAC\u2019s internal groups (Negotiations Central and Implementation branch) as well as the Department of Natural Resources Canada are in place to ensure that any update to the attributes data or geography is reflected in the Treaties and Aboriginal Agreements geospatial information.\n\nThis dataset is Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) primary source for Pre-1975 Treaties geographic boundaries on maps.\n\nThis dataset can also be viewed in the Aboriginal and Treaty Rights Information System (ATRIS). This web-based system provides access to information to inform governments, industry and other interested parties in determining their consultation obligations and in carrying out their consultation research.\"\n\nFor more information, visit http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100014686/1100100014687.", "attribution": "Government of Canada; Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada; Geomatics Services", "attribution_link": "https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/f281b150-0645-48e4-9c30-01f55f93f78e", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-09-13T20:07:52.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-02-25T18:48:41.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-09-13T20:07:52.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-02-25T18:54:03.000Z", "columns_name": ["French Name", "SBTP_FNAME", "SBTP_ENAME", "ENAME", "TAG_ID", "the_geom"], "columns_field_name": ["fname", "sbtp_fname", "sbtp_ename", "ename", "tag_id", "the_geom"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "MultiPolygon"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-02-25T18:54:04.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["environment"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Geospatial Boundaries", "domain_tags": ["aboriginal lands", "aboriginal peoples", "aboriginal rights", "agreements", "boundaries", "comprehensive land claim", "indigenous", "self-government", "settlement lands", "treaty"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Time-Frame_Update-Frequency", "value": "When Necessary"}, {"key": "Time-Frame_Automated-or-Manual", "value": "Automated"}, {"key": "Spatial_Coordinate-System", "value": "3TM114-83"}, {"key": "Quality-Indicators_Duplicates-Removed", "value": "Yes"}, {"key": "Quality-Indicators_Verified-for-Accuracy", "value": "Yes"}, {"key": "Story-Attributes_Internal-embed-viz", "value": "1"}, {"key": "General-Information_Primary-Dataset-or-View", "value": "View"}, {"key": "General-Information_Internal-or-External", "value": "External"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.edmonton.ca", "license": "See Terms of Use"}, "permalink": "https://data.edmonton.ca/d/p5gj-tysf", "link": "https://data.edmonton.ca/Geospatial-Boundaries/Pre-1975-Treaties-Historic-Treaties-/p5gj-tysf", "owner": {"id": "dhgx-s4x9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "opendata@edmonton.ca"}, "creator": {"id": "dhgx-s4x9", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "opendata@edmonton.ca"}}

Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).\r\n\r\nDue to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.\r\n\r\nDetails of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:\r\n- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals\r\n- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)\r\n- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)\r\n- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)\r\n- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10.

Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.\n\nThings to note:\n\nDFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.\nDFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.\nDFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.\nDFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.", "attribution": "City of Edmonton", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-10-31T16:52:32.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-08-30T11:48:52.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-10-31T16:52:29.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-10-31T16:52:32.000Z", "columns_name": ["Maximum Speed for Bin Number", "Vehicle Count for Log Interval", "Site ID", "Row ID", "Vehicle Count at Slowest Speed Detected", "Minimum Speed for Bin Number", "Log Timestamp", "Speed Range for Bin", "Bin Over Speed Limit Flag", "Bin Number", "Speed Unit of Measure", "Maximum Speed Detection Setting", "Direction", "Vehicle Count at Highest Speed Detected", "Minimum Speed Detection Setting", "Speed Limit", "Location Description"], "columns_field_name": ["maximum_speed_for_bin_number", "vehicle_count_for_log_interval", "site_id", "row_id", "vehicle_count_at_slowest_speed_detected", "minimum_speed_for_bin_number", "log_timestamp", "speed_range_for_bin", "bin_over_speed_limit_flag", "bin_number", "speed_unit_of_measure", "maximum_speed_detection_setting", "direction", "vehicle_count_at_highest_speed_detected", "minimum_speed_detection_setting", "speed_limit", "location_description"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["The fastest detected speed travelled that corresponds to the Bin Number.

EPCOR makes no guarantee, representation or warranty, express or implied, including that the data is true, accurate, complete, fit for a specific purpose or non-infringing, and no responsibility of any kind is accepted by EPCOR or EPCOR representatives for the completeness or accuracy of the data. EPCOR and its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees and other representatives shall not be liable to any person or entity as a result of the use or other handling of the data.\n* The hexagon grid utilized to present the average water network capacity data has been updated by EPCOR. As such, this version of the dataset should not be directly compared to previous versions of this dataset.\n* The average water network capacity is intended to be understood in a relative manner: e.g. a blue area is anticipated to provide higher flows on average than a green area.\n* Any city block area that indicates 0-50 L/s water network capacity has been evaluated by Edmonton Fire Rescue Services (EFRS). EFRS does not associate any significant risk with these areas and can adapt a response to a fire event in these areas given the small geographical area and buildings affected.\n* The results presented in this data were determined using computer modelling software that represented the distribution and transmission water network current in EWS's digital records as of February 16, 2023. Modifications to the water system after this date may change the water network capacity at any given time or place.\n* The results presented in this data represent the overall average water network capacity in an area during computer-simulated conditions at EPCOR-owned hydrants. Other factors may change the water network capacity at any given time or place.\n*The results presented in this data are not representative of lot-level available fire flow as outlined in the Volume 4 Design and Construction Standards.\n* The average water network capacity ranges are only indicative of average system capacity and not indicative of EPCOR-owned hydrant spacing. A development may still require infrastructure upgrades to meet minimum hydrant spacing requirements.\n* This map is not a substitute for directed engineering inquiries regarding infrastructure improvements to support development.

Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.\r\n\r\nThings to note:\r\n\r\nDFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.\r\nDFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.\r\nDFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.\r\nDFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.", "attribution": "City of Edmonton", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-10-31T17:30:30.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-12-21T16:30:28.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-10-31T17:30:28.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-10-31T17:30:30.000Z", "columns_name": ["Vehicle Count at Highest Speed Detected", "Vehicle Count at Slowest Speed Detected", "Minimum Speed for Bin Number", "Vehicle Count for Log Interval", "Minimum Speed Detection Setting", "Direction", "Row ID", "Log Timestamp", "Bin Over Speed Limit Flag", "Maximum Speed for Bin Number", "Site ID", "Speed Range for Bin", "Maximum Speed Detection Setting", "Bin Number", "Speed Unit of Measure", "Speed Limit", "Location Description"], "columns_field_name": ["vehicle_count_at_highest_speed_detected", "vehicle_count_at_slowest_speed_detected", "minimum_speed_for_bin_number", "vehicle_count_for_log_interval", "minimum_speed_detection_setting", "direction", "row_id", "log_timestamp", "bin_over_speed_limit_flag", "maximum_speed_for_bin_number", "site_id", "speed_range_for_bin", "maximum_speed_detection_setting", "bin_number", "speed_unit_of_measure", "speed_limit", "location_description"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["The number of vehicles counted in the 15 minute time interval where the detected fastest speed of the vehicle was equal to or greater than the Minimum Speed for the Bin and is less than or equal to the Maximum Speed for the Bin.", "The number of vehicles counted in the 15 minute time interval where the detected slowest speed of the vehicle was equal to or greater than the Minimum Speed for the Bin and is less than or equal to the Maximum Speed for the Bin.", "The slowest detected speed travelled that corresponds to the Bin Number.

For the rest of the areas Bare Earth LiDar data was used.  The surface data used was set to a horizontal resolution of 2.5 meters with a grid cell of 5m by 5m.

If someone notices a person sitting on a Buddy Bench, they are encouraged to sit with them and start up a conversation.\r\n\r\nThe Buddy Bench Pilot Project is part of the \u201cHello, How Are You?\u201d (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/hello-how-are-you.aspx) campaign, which encompasses two council initiatives: the Council Initiative on Urban Isolation and Mental Health (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/urban-isolation-mental-health.aspx) and the Council Initiative on Seniors (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/senior-isolation-loneliness.aspx). The campaign encourages Edmontonians to connect within their communities to help prevent social isolation. The pilot came about after a young boy approached city administration hoping to have his school\u2019s Buddy Bench concept implemented on a larger scale.
