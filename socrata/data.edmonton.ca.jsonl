The model is based on a theoretical, worst-case scenario storm that has never occurred in the Edmonton area.\r\n\r\nModel Accuracy:\r\n\r\nFor Areas west and central Digital Elevation Model was used from 2004.  For the rest of the areas Bare Earth LiDar data was used.  The surface data used was set to a horizontal resolution of 2.5 meters with a grid cell of 5m by 5m.  This puts the vertical resolution at an accuracy of 0.1 meters. \r\n\r\nThis is a spline fit interpolations model.  This is a 1D-1D model with 2D interpolations.The accuracy of the information provided in these data sets is plus or minus 10 cm vertically, and 10 cm horizontally.   \r\n\r\nThe 100 year flood was based on the 2015 Edmonton 4 year Chicago storm event over 20 plus neighbourhoods.  The data is a collection of the worst case scenario of model runs.  \r\nThis is a common practice for Edmonton drainage models.  These models are high level concept and projects determined from this data set will undergo finer, more detailed modeling.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: No Warranty with Flood Risk Maps.\r\nYour use of the flood risk maps is solely at your own risk, and you are fully responsible for any consequences arising from your use of the flood risk maps.

On June 27, 2017, Buddy Benches were placed in Edmonton neighbourhoods as a pilot project to help turn strangers into neighbours.\r\n\r\nThese benches are specifically painted to invite people to sit on them all year round. If someone notices a person sitting on a Buddy Bench, they are encouraged to sit with them and start up a conversation.\r\n\r\nThe Buddy Bench Pilot Project is part of the \u201cHello, How Are You?\u201d (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/hello-how-are-you) campaign, which encompasses two council initiatives: the Council Initiative on Urban Isolation and Mental Health (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/urban-isolation-mental-health) and the Council Initiative on Seniors (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/senior-isolation-loneliness). The campaign encourages Edmontonians to connect within their communities to help prevent social isolation. The pilot came about after a young boy approached city administration hoping to have his school\u2019s Buddy Bench concept implemented on a larger scale. Thanks to this suggestion, Buddy Benches will allow Edmontonians of all ages to support each other and start up a conversation simply by saying \u201cHello, how are you?\u201d\r\n\r\nAge Friendly Edmonton Partnership\r\nIn a partnership with Age Friendly Edmonton (https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/initiatives_innovation/age-friendly-edmonton), we are proud to announce that we have new wooden Buddy Benches around the city.

The model is based on a theoretical, worst-case scenario storm that has never occurred in the Edmonton area.\r\n\r\nModel Accuracy:\r\n\r\nFor Areas west and central Digital Elevation Model was used from 2004.  For the rest of the areas Bare Earth LiDar data was used.  The surface data used was set to a horizontal resolution of 2.5 meters with a grid cell of 5m by 5m.  This puts the vertical resolution at an accuracy of 0.1 meters. \r\n\r\nThis is a spline fit interpolations model.  This is a 1D-1D model with 2D interpolations.The accuracy of the information provided in these data sets is plus or minus 10 cm vertically, and 10 cm horizontally.   \r\n\r\nThe 100 year flood was based on the 2015 Edmonton 4 year Chicago storm event over 20 plus neighbourhoods.  The data is a collection of the worst case scenario of model runs.  \r\nThis is a common practice for Edmonton drainage models.  These models are high level concept and projects determined from this data set will undergo finer, more detailed modeling.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: No Warranty with Flood Risk Maps.\r\nYour use of the flood risk maps is solely at your own risk, and you are fully responsible for any consequences arising from your use of the flood risk maps.

Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).\n\nDue to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.\n\nDetails of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:\n- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals\n- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)\n- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)\n- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)\n- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10.
