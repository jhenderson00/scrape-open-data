These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).\n\nDue to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.\n\nDetails of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:\n- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals\n- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)\n- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)\n- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)\n- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.\n\nThings to note:\n\nDFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.\nDFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.\nDFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.\nDFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.", "attribution": "City of Edmonton", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-03-19T18:03:02.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-08-17T16:53:52.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-03-19T18:02:59.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-03-19T18:03:02.000Z", "columns_name": ["Maximum Speed for Bin Number", "Log Timestamp", "Minimum Speed Detection Setting", "Speed Limit", "Vehicle Count at Slowest Speed Detected", "Bin Over Speed Limit Flag", "Minimum Speed for Bin Number", "Row ID", "Vehicle Count at Highest Speed Detected", "Vehicle Count for Log Interval", "Location Description", "Direction", "Site ID", "Bin Number", "Maximum Speed Detection Setting", "Speed Unit of Measure", "Speed Range for Bin"], "columns_field_name": ["maximum_speed_for_bin_number", "log_timestamp", "minimum_speed_detection_setting", "speed_limit", "vehicle_count_at_slowest_speed_detected", "bin_over_speed_limit_flag", "minimum_speed_for_bin_number", "row_id", "vehicle_count_at_highest_speed_detected", "vehicle_count_for_log_interval", "location_description", "direction", "site_id", "bin_number", "maximum_speed_detection_setting", "speed_unit_of_measure", "speed_range_for_bin"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["The fastest detected speed travelled that corresponds to the Bin Number.
