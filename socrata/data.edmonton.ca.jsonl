These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).\r\n\r\nDue to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.\r\n\r\nDetails of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:\r\n- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals\r\n- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)\r\n- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)\r\n- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)\r\n- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.\r\n\r\nThings to note:\r\n\r\nDFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.\r\nDFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.\r\nDFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.\r\nDFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.", "attribution": "City of Edmonton", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-11-28T23:29:29.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-09-02T01:27:05.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-11-28T23:29:27.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-11-28T23:29:29.000Z", "columns_name": ["Vehicle Count at Highest Speed Detected", "Vehicle Count at Slowest Speed Detected", "Minimum Speed for Bin Number", "Vehicle Count for Log Interval", "Log Timestamp", "Row ID", "Bin Over Speed Limit Flag", "Maximum Speed for Bin Number", "Minimum Speed Detection Setting", "Speed Range for Bin", "Direction", "Location Description", "Site ID", "Bin Number", "Speed Unit of Measure", "Maximum Speed Detection Setting", "Speed Limit"], "columns_field_name": ["vehicle_count_at_highest_speed_detected", "vehicle_count_at_slowest_speed_detected", "minimum_speed_for_bin_number", "vehicle_count_for_log_interval", "log_timestamp", "row_id", "bin_over_speed_limit_flag", "maximum_speed_for_bin_number", "minimum_speed_detection_setting", "speed_range_for_bin", "direction", "location_description", "site_id", "bin_number", "speed_unit_of_measure", "maximum_speed_detection_setting", "speed_limit"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["The number of vehicles counted in the 15 minute time interval where the detected fastest speed of the vehicle was equal to or greater than the Minimum Speed for the Bin and is less than or equal to the Maximum Speed for the Bin.", "The number of vehicles counted in the 15 minute time interval where the detected slowest speed of the vehicle was equal to or greater than the Minimum Speed for the Bin and is less than or equal to the Maximum Speed for the Bin.", "The slowest detected speed travelled that corresponds to the Bin Number.
