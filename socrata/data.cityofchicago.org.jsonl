Data are shown as is from the electronic crash reporting system (E-Crash) at CPD, excluding any personally identifiable information. Records are added to the data portal when a crash report is finalized or when amendments are made to an existing report in E-Crash. Data from E-Crash are available for some police districts in 2015, but citywide data are not available until September 2017. About half of all crash reports, mostly minor crashes, are self-reported at the police district by the driver(s) involved and the other half are recorded at the scene by the police officer responding to the crash. Many of the crash parameters, including street condition data, weather condition, and posted speed limits, are recorded by the reporting officer based on best available information at the time, but many of these may disagree with posted information or other assessments on road conditions. If any new or updated information on a crash is received, the reporting officer may amend the crash report at a later time. A traffic crash within the city limits for which CPD is not the responding police agency, typically crashes on interstate highways, freeway ramps, and on local roads along the City boundary, are excluded from this dataset.\n\nAll crashes are recorded as per the format specified in the Traffic Crash Report, SR1050, of the Illinois Department of Transportation. The crash data published on the Chicago data portal mostly follows the data elements in SR1050 form.

A Depends Upon Requirements contract is an indefinite quantities contract in which the City places orders as needed and the vendor is not guaranteed any particular contract award amount. \r\n\r\nBlanket vs. Standard Contracts: Only blanket contracts (contracts for repeated purchases) have FMPS end dates.

{"resource": {"name": "Arrests", "id": "dpt3-jri9", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Each record in this dataset shows information about an arrest executed by the Chicago Police Department (CPD). Source data comes from the CPD Automated Arrest application. This electronic application is part of the CPD CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system, and is used to process arrests Department-wide.\n\nA more-detailed version of this dataset is available to media by request. To make a request, please email <a href=\"mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org?subject=Arrests Access Request\">dataportal@cityofchicago.org</a> with the subject line: <b>Arrests Access Request</b>. Access will require an account on this site, which you may create at https://data.cityofchicago.org/signup. New data fields may be added to this public dataset in the future. Requests for individual arrest reports or any other related data other than access to the more-detailed dataset should be directed to <a href=\"https://home.chicagopolice.org/services/adult-arrest-search/\">CPD</a>, through contact information on that site or a <a href=\"http://www.chicago.gov/foia\">Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)</a> request.\n\nThe data is limited to adult arrests, defined as any arrest where the arrestee was 18 years of age or older on the date of arrest. The data excludes arrest records expunged by CPD pursuant to the Illinois Criminal Identification Act (20 ILCS 2630/5.2). \n\nDepartment members use charges that appear in Illinois Compiled Statutes or Municipal Code of Chicago. Arrestees may be charged with multiple offenses from these sources. Each record in the dataset includes up to four charges, ordered by severity and with CHARGE1 as the most severe charge. Severity is defined based on charge class and charge type, criteria that are routinely used by Illinois court systems to determine penalties for conviction. In case of a tie, charges are presented in the order that the arresting officer listed the charges on the arrest report. By policy, Department members are provided general instructions to emphasize seriousness of the offense when ordering charges on an arrest report. \n\nEach record has an additional set of columns where a charge characteristic (statute, description, type, or class) for all four charges, or fewer if there were not four charges, is concatenated with the | character. These columns can be used with the Filter function's \"Contains\" operator to find all records where a value appears, without having to search four separate columns.\n\nUsers interested in learning more about CPD arrest processes can review current directives, using the CPD Automated Directives system (http://directives.chicagopolice.org/directives/).

If a ZIP was missing or was not valid, it is displayed as \"Unknown\". \r\n \r\nCases with a positive molecular (PCR) or antigen test are included in this dataset. Cases are counted based on the week the test specimen was collected. For privacy reasons, until a ZIP Code reaches five cumulative cases, both the weekly and cumulative case counts will be blank. Therefore, summing the \u201cCases - Weekly\u201d column is not a reliable way to determine case totals. Deaths are those that have occurred among cases based on the week of death.\r\n \r\nFor tests, each test is counted once, based on the week the test specimen was collected. Tests performed prior to 3/1/2020 are not included. Test counts include multiple tests for the same person (a change made on 10/29/2020). PCR and antigen tests reported to Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) through electronic lab reporting are included. Electronic lab reporting has taken time to onboard and testing availability has shifted over time, so these counts are likely an underestimate of community infection.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cPercent Tested Positive\u201d columns are calculated by dividing the number of positive tests by the number of total tests . Because of the data limitations for the Tests columns, such as persons being tested multiple times as a requirement for employment, these percentages may vary in either direction from the actual disease prevalence in the ZIP Code. \r\n \r\nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received. \r\n\r\nTo compare ZIP Codes to Chicago Community Areas, please see http://data.cmap.illinois.gov/opendata/uploads/CKAN/NONCENSUS/ADMINISTRATIVE_POLITICAL_BOUNDARIES/CCAzip.pdf.

For a more detailed description, go to: http://bit.ly/Q9AZAD. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (nonfreeway\r\nstreets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every ten minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimate by traffic segments gives the observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic.\r\n\r\nTraffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area).\r\nThis dataset contains the current estimated speed for about 1250 segments covering 300 miles of arterial roads.\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent\r\nintersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes.

This dataset should be used in conjunction with the traffic Crash and People dataset available in the portal. \u201cVehicle\u201d information includes motor vehicle and non-motor vehicle modes of transportation, such as bicycles and pedestrians. Each mode of transportation involved in a crash is a \u201cunit\u201d and get one entry here. Each vehicle, each pedestrian, each motorcyclist, and each bicyclist is considered an independent unit that can have a trajectory separate from the other units. However, people inside a vehicle including the driver do not have a trajectory separate from the vehicle in which they are travelling and hence only the vehicle they are travelling in get any entry here. This type of identification of \u201cunits\u201d is needed to determine how each movement affected the crash. Data for occupants who do not make up an independent unit, typically drivers and passengers, are available in the People table. Many of the fields are coded to denote the type and location of damage on the vehicle. Vehicle information can be linked back to Crash data using the \u201cCRASH_RECORD_ID\u201d field.

For a detailed description, go to: http://bitly.com/TeqrNv. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). \r\n\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes.

This dataset is historical-only.\n\nThe Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) oversees the patching of potholes on over 4,000 miles of arterial and residential streets in Chicago. CDOT receives reports of potholes through the 311 call center and uses a computerized mapping and tracking system to identify pothole locations and efficiently schedule crews.  One call to 311 can generate multiple pothole repairs. When a crew arrives to repair a 311 pothole, it fills all the other potholes within the block.  Pothole repairs are generally completed within 7 days from the first report of a pothole to 311. Weather conditions, particularly frigid temps and precipitation, influence how long a repair takes.  On days when weather is cooperative and there is no precipitation, crews can fill several thousand potholes.  \n\nIf a previous request is already open for a buffer of 4 addresses the request is given the status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".  For example, if there is an existing CSR for 6535 N Western and a new request is received for 6531 N Western (which is within four addresses of the original CSR) then the new request is given a status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".\n\nOnce the street is repaired, the status in CSR will read \u201cCompleted\u201d for the original request and \"Duplicate (Closed)\" for any duplicate requests.  A service request also receives the status of \u201cCompleted\u201d when the reported address is inspected but no potholes are found or have already been filled.  If another issue is found with the street, such as a \u201ccave-in\u201d or \u201cfailed utility cut\u201d, then it is directed to the appropriate department or contractor. \n\nData Owner: Transportation.

{"resource": {"name": "Violence Reduction - Victims of Homicides and Non-Fatal Shootings", "id": "gumc-mgzr", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This dataset contains individual-level homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, including homicide data from 1991 to the present, and non-fatal shooting data from 2010 to the present (2010 is the earliest available year for shooting data). This dataset includes a \"GUNSHOT_INJURY_I \" column to indicate whether the victimization involved a shooting, showing either Yes (\"Y\"), No (\"N\"), or Unknown (\"UKNOWN.\") For homicides, injury descriptions are available dating back to 1991, so the \"shooting\" column will read either \"Y\" or \"N\" to indicate whether the homicide was a fatal shooting or not. For non-fatal shootings, data is only available as of 2010. As a result, for any non-fatal shootings that occurred from 2010 to the present, the shooting column will read as \u201cY.\u201d Non-fatal shooting victims will not be included in this dataset prior to 2010; they will be included in the authorized-access dataset, but with \"UNKNOWN\" in the shooting column.\n\nEach row represents a single victimization, i.e., a unique event when an individual became the victim of a homicide or non-fatal shooting. Each row does not represent a unique victim\u2014if someone is victimized multiple times there will be multiple rows for each of those distinct events. \n\nThe dataset is refreshed daily, but excludes the most recent complete day to allow the Chicago Police Department (CPD) time to gather the best available information. Each time the dataset is refreshed, records can change as CPD learns more about each victimization, especially those victimizations that are most recent. The data on the Mayor's Office Violence Reduction Dashboard is updated daily with an approximately 48-hour lag. As cases are passed from the initial reporting officer to the investigating detectives, some recorded data about incidents and victimizations may change once additional information arises. Regularly updated datasets on the City's public portal may change to reflect new or corrected information.\n\nA version of this dataset with additional crime types is available by request. To make a request, please email <a href=\"mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org?subject=Violence Reduction Victims Access Request\">dataportal@cityofchicago.org</a> with the subject line: <b>Violence Reduction Victims Access Request</b>. Access will require an account on this site, which you may create at https://data.cityofchicago.org/signup.\n\nHow does this dataset classify victims?\n\nThe methodology by which this dataset classifies victims of violent crime differs by victimization type:\n\nHomicide and non-fatal shooting victims: A victimization is considered a homicide victimization or non-fatal shooting victimization depending on its presence in CPD's homicide victims data table or its shooting victims data table. A victimization is considered a homicide only if it is present in CPD's homicide data table, while a victimization is considered a non-fatal shooting only if it is present in CPD's shooting data tables and absent from CPD's homicide data table.\n\nTo determine the IUCR code of homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, we defer to the incident IUCR code available in CPD's Crimes, 2001-present dataset (available on the City's open data portal). If the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes dataset is inconsistent with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization, we defer to CPD's Victims dataset. \nFor a criminal homicide, the only sensible IUCR codes are 0110 (first-degree murder) or 0130 (second-degree murder). For a non-fatal shooting, a sensible IUCR code must signify a criminal sexual assault, a robbery, or, most commonly, an aggravated battery. In rare instances, the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes and Victims dataset do not align with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization:\n\n1. In instances where a homicide victimization does not correspond to an IUCR code 0110 or 0130, we set the IUCR code to \"01XX\"  to indicate that the victimization was a homicide but we do not know whether it was a first-degree murder", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "https://www.chicago.gov", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-03-24T12:37:34.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-05-05T20:04:20.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2021-11-18T15:28:17.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-03-24T12:37:34.000Z", "columns_name": ["DATE", "BEAT", "HOMICIDE_VICTIM_MI", "STREET_OUTREACH_ORGANIZATION", "HOMICIDE_VICTIM_LAST_NAME", "CASE_NUMBER", "ZIP_CODE", "COMMUNITY_AREA", "STATE_SENATE_DISTRICT", "VICTIMIZATION_IUCR_CD", "INCIDENT_IUCR_SECONDARY", "VICTIMIZATION_FBI_DESCR", "AREA", "LOCATION", "HOMICIDE_VICTIM_FIRST_NAME", "AGE", "Wards", "INCIDENT_IUCR_CD", "GUNSHOT_INJURY_I", "WARD", "BLOCK", "Police Districts", "HOUR", "LOCATION_DESCRIPTION", "UPDATED", "VICTIMIZATION_IUCR_SECONDARY", "INCIDENT_PRIMARY", "DISTRICT", "DAY_OF_WEEK", "LONGITUDE", "RACE", "VICTIMIZATION_FBI_CD", "SEX", "LATITUDE", "UNIQUE_ID", "Police Beats", "INCIDENT_FBI_CD", "VICTIMIZATION_PRIMARY", "MONTH", "INCIDENT_FBI_DESCR", "Community Areas", "Boundaries - ZIP Codes", "STATE_HOUSE_DISTRICT"], "columns_field_name": ["date", "beat", "homicide_victim_mi", "street_outreach_organization", "homicide_victim_last_name", "case_number", "zip_code", "community_area", "state_senate_district", "victimization_iucr_cd", "incident_iucr_secondary", "victimization_fbi_descr", "area", "location", "homicide_victim_first_name", "age", ":@computed_region_43wa_7qmu", "incident_iucr_cd", "gunshot_injury_i", "ward", "block", ":@computed_region_d9mm_jgwp", "hour", "location_description", "updated", "victimization_iucr_secondary", "incident_primary", "district", "day_of_week", "longitude", "race", "victimization_fbi_cd", "sex", "latitude", "unique_id", ":@computed_region_d3ds_rm58", "incident_fbi_cd", "victimization_primary", "month", "incident_fbi_descr", ":@computed_region_vrxf_vc4k", ":@computed_region_rpca_8um6", "state_house_district"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Point", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Date when the victimization occurred.

(See City Council Meeting schedule: https://chicago.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx.)  The collection of street segments for a single zone (collectively identified by Zone number) are not required to constitute a seamless polygon; however, they must be contiguous; in this sense, \u201cZones\u201d often closer resemble a collection of intersecting segments rather than an unbroken area. Segments are commonly categorized as being either \u201cStandard\u201d or \u201cBuffer\u201d: Standard means that signs exist on the street segment beginning at the low-point and ending at the high-point; Buffer means that physical signs do not exist for that zone on that physical street, but residents of addresses within that segment shall have the privilege to purchase zone products (daily permits and annual passes) for that zone, as if physical signs were installed.  (In this way, segments designated as \u2018Buffer\u2019 can in fact overlap with either other buffers and/or standard segments.)  Physical signs will display the zone number and the day/times when the zone restriction is in effect, e.g., \u201cAll Times\u201d / \u201cAnytime\u201d; \u201cMonday through Friday\u201d; \u201c6am \u2013 6pm All Days.\u201d  During restricted days/times, any vehicle parked in the zone which does not display a valid unexpired zone product (either a daily permit or an annual pass printed on the City Vehicle Sticker) is subject to ticketing/enforcement.

As of 2016, this list includes all commercial, institutional, and residential buildings larger than 50,000 square feet. The information in this dataset should be used by building owners / managers or other building representatives to determine if your property needs to comply by the annual deadline of June 1st. This data can also be used to look up your property's unique 6-digit Chicago Energy Benchmarking ID, which is required for compliance. (The ID is also included the notification letters sent by the City.)\r\n\r\nThe Energy Benchmarking Ordinance calls on existing municipal, commercial, and residential buildings larger than 50,000 square feet to track whole-building energy use, report to the City annually, and verify data accuracy every three years. The law, which phases in from 2014-2017, covers less than 1% of Chicago\u2019s buildings, which account for approximately 20% of total energy used by all buildings. For more details, including ordinance text, rules and regulations, and timing, please visit www.CityofChicago.org/EnergyBenchmarking.\r\n\r\nNote that the ordinance authorizes the City to make individual building data readily-available to the public, beginning with the second year in which a building is covered. The Covered Buildings List is distinct from the publicly-shared energy use data, and does not include energy use or any other information reported in the benchmarking process. For the building-specific energy use dataset, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/xq83-jr8c.\r\n\r\nIf your property is on this list, and you do not believe you are covered by the ordinance, please submit the appropriate online exemption form at: www.CityofChicago.org/EnergyBenchmarking. If your property is not on the list, and it meets the compliance criteria, please check for any alternative building addresses. If the building is still not found, please submit the Building ID Request Form (http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/iframe/Benchmarking_ID_Request.html). The Chicago Energy Benchmarking Help Center can assist with any other questions, and can be reached at (855)858-6878, or by email: Info@ChicagoEnergyBenchmarking.org.\r\n\r\nThis dataset will be refreshed periodically as additional information becomes available.

On January 1, 2012, the DOE was disbanded and all its inspection, permitting, and enforcement authorities were transferred to the CDPH.   \nData fields requiring description are detailed below. \nMAPPED LOCATION: Contains latitude/longitude coordinates of the site as determined through the Chicago Open Data Portal\u2019s geocoding engine. In instances where the facility address is a range, the lower number (the value in the \u201cStreet Number From\u201d column) is used for geocoding.
