Data are shown as is from the electronic crash reporting system (E-Crash) at CPD, excluding any personally identifiable information. Records are added to the data portal when a crash report is finalized or when amendments are made to an existing report in E-Crash. Data from E-Crash are available for some police districts in 2015, but citywide data are not available until September 2017. About half of all crash reports, mostly minor crashes, are self-reported at the police district by the driver(s) involved and the other half are recorded at the scene by the police officer responding to the crash. Many of the crash parameters, including street condition data, weather condition, and posted speed limits, are recorded by the reporting officer based on best available information at the time, but many of these may disagree with posted information or other assessments on road conditions. If any new or updated information on a crash is received, the reporting officer may amend the crash report at a later time. A traffic crash within the city limits for which CPD is not the responding police agency, typically crashes on interstate highways, freeway ramps, and on local roads along the City boundary, are excluded from this dataset.\n\nAll crashes are recorded as per the format specified in the Traffic Crash Report, SR1050, of the Illinois Department of Transportation. The crash data published on the Chicago data portal mostly follows the data elements in SR1050 form.

Source data comes from the CPD Automated Arrest application. This electronic application is part of the CPD CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system, and is used to process arrests Department-wide.\n\nA more-detailed version of this dataset is available to media by request. To make a request, please email <a href=\"mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org?subject=Arrests Access Request\">dataportal@cityofchicago.org</a> with the subject line: <b>Arrests Access Request</b>. Access will require an account on this site, which you may create at https://data.cityofchicago.org/signup. New data fields may be added to this public dataset in the future. Requests for individual arrest reports or any other related data other than access to the more-detailed dataset should be directed to <a href=\"https://home.chicagopolice.org/services/adult-arrest-search/\">CPD</a>, through contact information on that site or a <a href=\"http://www.chicago.gov/foia\">Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)</a> request.\n\nThe data is limited to adult arrests, defined as any arrest where the arrestee was 18 years of age or older on the date of arrest. The data excludes arrest records expunged by CPD pursuant to the Illinois Criminal Identification Act (20 ILCS 2630/5.2). \n\nDepartment members use charges that appear in Illinois Compiled Statutes or Municipal Code of Chicago. Arrestees may be charged with multiple offenses from these sources. Each record in the dataset includes up to four charges, ordered by severity and with CHARGE1 as the most severe charge. Severity is defined based on charge class and charge type, criteria that are routinely used by Illinois court systems to determine penalties for conviction. In case of a tie, charges are presented in the order that the arresting officer listed the charges on the arrest report. By policy, Department members are provided general instructions to emphasize seriousness of the offense when ordering charges on an arrest report. \n\nEach record has an additional set of columns where a charge characteristic (statute, description, type, or class) for all four charges, or fewer if there were not four charges, is concatenated with the | character. These columns can be used with the Filter function's \"Contains\" operator to find all records where a value appears, without having to search four separate columns.\n\nUsers interested in learning more about CPD arrest processes can review current directives, using the CPD Automated Directives system (http://directives.chicagopolice.org/directives/).

If a ZIP was missing or was not valid, it is displayed as \"Unknown\". \n \nCases with a positive molecular (PCR) or antigen test are included in this dataset. Cases are counted based on the week the test specimen was collected. For privacy reasons, until a ZIP Code reaches five cumulative cases, both the weekly and cumulative case counts will be blank. Therefore, summing the \u201cCases - Weekly\u201d column is not a reliable way to determine case totals. Deaths are those that have occurred among cases based on the week of death.\n \nFor tests, each test is counted once, based on the week the test specimen was collected. Tests performed prior to 3/1/2020 are not included. Test counts include multiple tests for the same person (a change made on 10/29/2020). PCR and antigen tests reported to Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) through electronic lab reporting are included. Electronic lab reporting has taken time to onboard and testing availability has shifted over time, so these counts are likely an underestimate of community infection.\n\nThe \u201cPercent Tested Positive\u201d columns are calculated by dividing the number of positive tests by the number of total tests . Because of the data limitations for the Tests columns, such as persons being tested multiple times as a requirement for employment, these percentages may vary in either direction from the actual disease prevalence in the ZIP Code. \n \nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received. \n\nTo compare ZIP Codes to Chicago Community Areas, please see http://data.cmap.illinois.gov/opendata/uploads/CKAN/NONCENSUS/ADMINISTRATIVE_POLITICAL_BOUNDARIES/CCAzip.pdf.

If the docket is a City Non-Suit or the owner is found to be Not Liable, then no payment is required. Note that multiple addresses may be associated with a violation; in these cases, multiple records will be included in this dataset for a single violation. / Data Owners: Administrative Hearings / Finance / Time Period: January 1, 2011 to present  / Update Frequency: Data is updated daily", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "http://www.cityofchicago.org", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-06-27T12:18:54.000Z", "createdAt": "2011-12-22T20:59:19.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-06-27T12:18:54.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-06-27T12:18:05.000Z", "columns_name": ["Docket Number", "Violation Number", "Issued Date", "Issuing Department", "Last Hearing Date", "Property Address", "Violation Type", "Entity or Person(s)", "Disposition Description", "Total Fines", "Total Administrative Costs", "Interest Amount", "Collection Costs or Attorney Fees", "Court Cost", "Original Total Amount Due", "Total Paid", "Current Amount Due", "Latitude", "Longitude", "Location", "Boundaries - ZIP Codes", "Community Areas", "Zip Codes", "Census Tracts", "Wards"], "columns_field_name": ["docket_number", "violation_number", "issued_date", "issuing_department", "last_hearing_date", "property_address", "violation_type", "entity_or_person_s_", "disposition_description", "total_fines", "total_administrative_costs", "interest_amount", "collection_costs_or_attorney_fees", "court_cost", "original_total_amount_due", "total_paid", "current_amount_due", "latitude", "longitude", "location", ":@computed_region_rpca_8um6", ":@computed_region_vrxf_vc4k", ":@computed_region_6mkv_f3dw", ":@computed_region_bdys_3d7i", ":@computed_region_43wa_7qmu"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Point", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "This column was automatically created in order to record in what polygon from the dataset 'Boundaries - ZIP Codes' (rpca-8um6) the point in column 'location' is located.

This dataset should be used in conjunction with the traffic Crash and People dataset available in the portal. \u201cVehicle\u201d information includes motor vehicle and non-motor vehicle modes of transportation, such as bicycles and pedestrians. Each mode of transportation involved in a crash is a \u201cunit\u201d and get one entry here. Each vehicle, each pedestrian, each motorcyclist, and each bicyclist is considered an independent unit that can have a trajectory separate from the other units. However, people inside a vehicle including the driver do not have a trajectory separate from the vehicle in which they are travelling and hence only the vehicle they are travelling in get any entry here. This type of identification of \u201cunits\u201d is needed to determine how each movement affected the crash. Data for occupants who do not make up an independent unit, typically drivers and passengers, are available in the People table. Many of the fields are coded to denote the type and location of damage on the vehicle. Vehicle information can be linked back to Crash data using the \u201cCRASH_RECORD_ID\u201d field. Since this dataset is a combination of vehicles, pedestrians, and pedal cyclists not all columns are applicable to each record.

{"resource": {"name": "Chicago Traffic Tracker - Congestion Estimates by Segments", "id": "n4j6-wkkf", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This dataset contains the current estimated speed for about 1250 segments covering 300 miles of arterial roads. For a more detailed description, go to: http://bit.ly/Q9AZAD. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (nonfreeway\r\nstreets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every ten minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimate by traffic segments gives the observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic.\r\n\r\nTraffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region.

For a detailed description, go to: http://bitly.com/TeqrNv. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). \r\n\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves.

This dataset is historical-only.\n\nThe Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) oversees the patching of potholes on over 4,000 miles of arterial and residential streets in Chicago. CDOT receives reports of potholes through the 311 call center and uses a computerized mapping and tracking system to identify pothole locations and efficiently schedule crews.  One call to 311 can generate multiple pothole repairs. When a crew arrives to repair a 311 pothole, it fills all the other potholes within the block.  Pothole repairs are generally completed within 7 days from the first report of a pothole to 311. Weather conditions, particularly frigid temps and precipitation, influence how long a repair takes.  On days when weather is cooperative and there is no precipitation, crews can fill several thousand potholes.  \n\nIf a previous request is already open for a buffer of 4 addresses the request is given the status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".  For example, if there is an existing CSR for 6535 N Western and a new request is received for 6531 N Western (which is within four addresses of the original CSR) then the new request is given a status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".\n\nOnce the street is repaired, the status in CSR will read \u201cCompleted\u201d for the original request and \"Duplicate (Closed)\" for any duplicate requests.  A service request also receives the status of \u201cCompleted\u201d when the reported address is inspected but no potholes are found or have already been filled.  If another issue is found with the street, such as a \u201ccave-in\u201d or \u201cfailed utility cut\u201d, then it is directed to the appropriate department or contractor. \n\nData Owner: Transportation.

This dataset includes a \"GUNSHOT_INJURY_I \" column to indicate whether the victimization involved a shooting, showing either Yes (\"Y\"), No (\"N\"), or Unknown (\"UKNOWN.\") For homicides, injury descriptions are available dating back to 1991, so the \"shooting\" column will read either \"Y\" or \"N\" to indicate whether the homicide was a fatal shooting or not. For non-fatal shootings, data is only available as of 2010. As a result, for any non-fatal shootings that occurred from 2010 to the present, the shooting column will read as \u201cY.\u201d Non-fatal shooting victims will not be included in this dataset prior to 2010; they will be included in the authorized-access dataset, but with \"UNKNOWN\" in the shooting column.\r\n\r\nEach row represents a single victimization, i.e., a unique event when an individual became the victim of a homicide or non-fatal shooting. Each row does not represent a unique victim\u2014if someone is victimized multiple times there will be multiple rows for each of those distinct events. \r\n\r\nThe dataset is refreshed daily, but excludes the most recent complete day to allow the Chicago Police Department (CPD) time to gather the best available information. Each time the dataset is refreshed, records can change as CPD learns more about each victimization, especially those victimizations that are most recent. The data on the Mayor's Office Violence Reduction Dashboard is updated daily with an approximately 48-hour lag. As cases are passed from the initial reporting officer to the investigating detectives, some recorded data about incidents and victimizations may change once additional information arises. Regularly updated datasets on the City's public portal may change to reflect new or corrected information.\r\n\r\nA version of this dataset with additional crime types is available by request.

Access will require an account on this site, which you may create at https://data.cityofchicago.org/signup.\r\n\r\nHow does this dataset classify victims?\r\n\r\nThe methodology by which this dataset classifies victims of violent crime differs by victimization type:\r\n\r\nHomicide and non-fatal shooting victims: A victimization is considered a homicide victimization or non-fatal shooting victimization depending on its presence in CPD's homicide victims data table or its shooting victims data table. A victimization is considered a homicide only if it is present in CPD's homicide data table, while a victimization is considered a non-fatal shooting only if it is present in CPD's shooting data tables and absent from CPD's homicide data table.\r\n\r\nTo determine the IUCR code of homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, we defer to the incident IUCR code available in CPD's Crimes, 2001-present dataset (available on the City's open data portal). If the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes dataset is inconsistent with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization, we defer to CPD's Victims dataset. \r\nFor a criminal homicide, the only sensible IUCR codes are 0110 (first-degree murder) or 0130 (second-degree murder). For a non-fatal shooting, a sensible IUCR code must signify a criminal sexual assault, a robbery, or, most commonly, an aggravated battery. In rare instances, the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes and Victims dataset do not align with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization:\r\n\r\n1.

(See City Council Meeting schedule: https://chicago.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx.)

(In this way, segments designated as \u2018Buffer\u2019 can in fact overlap with either other buffers and/or standard segments.)

ShotSpotter is a gunshot detection system designed to automatically determine the location of potential outdoor gunfire. ShotSpotter audio sensors are placed in several CPD districts throughout the city (specific districts are noted below). If at least three sensors detect a sound that the ShotSpotter software determines to be potential gunfire, a location is determined and the alert is sent to human ShotSpotter analysts for review. Either the alert is sent to CPD, or it is dismissed. Each alert can contain multiple rounds of gunfire; sometimes there are multiple alerts for what may be determined to be one incident. More detail on the technology and its accuracy can be found on the company\u2019s website <a href=\"https://www.shotspotter.com\">here</a>.

As of 2016, this list includes all commercial, institutional, and residential buildings larger than 50,000 square feet. The information in this dataset should be used by building owners / managers or other building representatives to determine if your property needs to comply by the annual deadline of June 1st. This data can also be used to look up your property's unique 6-digit Chicago Energy Benchmarking ID, which is required for compliance. (The ID is also included the notification letters sent by the City.)\r\n\r\nThe Energy Benchmarking Ordinance calls on existing municipal, commercial, and residential buildings larger than 50,000 square feet to track whole-building energy use, report to the City annually, and verify data accuracy every three years. The law, which phases in from 2014-2017, covers less than 1% of Chicago\u2019s buildings, which account for approximately 20% of total energy used by all buildings. For more details, including ordinance text, rules and regulations, and timing, please visit www.CityofChicago.org/EnergyBenchmarking.\r\n\r\nNote that the ordinance authorizes the City to make individual building data readily-available to the public, beginning with the second year in which a building is covered.

For the building-specific energy use dataset, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/xq83-jr8c.\r\n\r\nIf your property is on this list, and you do not believe you are covered by the ordinance, please submit the appropriate online exemption form at: www.CityofChicago.org/EnergyBenchmarking.

The recommended dataset to use in its place is https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/COVID-19-Vaccination-Coverage-Citywide/6859-spec.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccinations administered to Chicago residents based on home address, as reported by medical providers in the Illinois Comprehensive Automated Immunization Registry Exchange (I-CARE). I-CARE includes doses administered in Illinois and some doses administered outside of Illinois and reported in I-CARE by Illinois providers. \n\nDefinitions: \n\u00b7People with at least one vaccine dose: Number of people who have received at least one dose of any COVID-19 vaccine, including the single-dose Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\u00b7People with a completed vaccine series: Number of people who have completed a primary COVID-19 vaccine series. Requirements vary depending on age and type of primary vaccine series received.\n\n\u00b7People with an original booster dose: Number of people who have a completed vaccine series and have received at least one additional monovalent dose. This includes people who received a monovalent booster dose and immunocompromised people who received an additional primary dose of COVID-19 vaccine.  Monovalent doses were created from the original strain of the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\n\u00b7People with a bivalent dose: Number of people who received a bivalent (updated) dose of vaccine. Updated, bivalent doses became available in Fall 2022 and were created with the original strain of COVID-19 and newer Omicron variant strains. \n\n\u00b7Total doses administered: Number of all COVID-19 vaccine doses administered.\n\nDaily counts are shown for the total number of doses administered, number of people with at least one vaccine dose, number of people who have a completed vaccine series, number of people with a monovalent booster dose, and number of people with a bivalent dose. Cumulative totals are also provided for each measure as of that date. Vaccinations are counted based on the day the vaccine was administered.\n\nCoverage percentages for the City of Chicago are calculated based on cumulative number of people with that vaccination status.\n\nDaily totals of all doses, number of people with at least one vaccine dose, number of people who have completed a vaccine series, number of people with a booster dose, and number of people with a bivalent dose are shown by age group, gender, and race/ethnicity.\n\nDenominators are from the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 1-year estimate for 2019 and can be seen in the Citywide, 2019 row of the Chicago Population Counts dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/85cm-7uqa).\n\nThe Chicago Department of Health (CDPH)   uses the most complete data available to estimate COVID-19 vaccination coverage among Chicagoans, but there are several limitations that impact our estimates. Data reported in I-CARE only include doses administered in Illinois and some doses administered outside of Illinois reported historically by Illinois providers. Doses administered by the federal Bureau of Prisons and Department of Defense, are also not currently reported in I-CARE. The Veterans Health Administration began reporting doses in I-CARE beginning September 2022. Due to people receiving vaccinations that are not recorded in I-CARE that can be linked to their record, such as someone receiving a vaccine dose in another state, the number of people with a completed series or a booster dose is underestimated. Inconsistencies in records of separate doses administered to the same person, such as slight variations in dates of birth, can result in duplicate first dose records for a person and overestimate of the number of people with at least one dose and underestimate the number of people with a completed series or booster dose.   \n\nAll data are provisional and subject to change.

The recommended dataset to use in its place is https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/COVID-19-Vaccination-Coverage-Citywide/6859-spec.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccinations administered to Chicago residents based on the reported race-ethnicity and age group of the person vaccinated, as provided by the medical provider in the Illinois Comprehensive Automated Immunization Registry Exchange (I-CARE). \n\nVaccination Status Definitions: \n\n\u00b7People with at least one vaccine dose: Number of people who have received at least one dose of any COVID-19 vaccine, including the single-dose Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. \n\n\u00b7People with a completed vaccine series: Number of people who have completed a primary COVID-19 vaccine series. Requirements vary depending on age and type of primary vaccine series received. \n\n\u00b7\u00b7People with an original booster dose: Number of people who have a completed vaccine series and have received at least one additional monovalent dose. This includes people who received a monovalent booster dose and immunocompromised people who received an additional primary dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Monovalent doses were created from the original strain of the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\n- People with a bivalent dose: Number of people who received a bivalent (updated) dose of vaccine. Updated, bivalent doses became available in Fall 2022 and were created with the original strain of COVID-19 and newer Omicron variant strains. \n\nWeekly cumulative totals by vaccination status are shown for each combination of race-ethnicity and age group. Note that each age group has a row where race-ethnicity is \"All\" so care should be taken when summing rows.\n\nVaccinations are counted based on the date on which they were administered. Weekly cumulative totals are reported from the week ending Saturday, December 19, 2020 onward (after December 15, when vaccines were first administered in Chicago) through the Saturday prior to the dataset being updated. \n\nPopulation counts are from the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey (ACS) 2019 1-year estimates. For some of the age groups by which COVID-19 vaccine has been authorized in the United States, race-ethnicity distributions were specifically reported in the ACS estimates. For others, race-ethnicity distributions were estimated by the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) by weighting the available race-ethnicity distributions, using proportions of constituent age groups. \n\nCoverage percentages are calculated based on the cumulative number of people in each population subgroup (age group by race-ethnicity) who have each vaccination status as of the date, divided by the estimated number of Chicago residents in each subgroup. \n\nActual counts may exceed population estimates and lead to >100% coverage, especially in small race-ethnicity subgroups of each age group. All coverage percentages are capped at 99%. \n\nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received and it is, in fact, very common for recent dates to be incomplete and to be updated as time goes on. At any given time, this dataset reflects data currently known to CDPH. \n\nNumbers in this dataset may differ from other public sources due to when data are reported and how City of Chicago boundaries are defined. \n\nCDPH uses the most complete data available to estimate COVID-19 vaccination coverage among Chicagoans, but there are several limitations that impact our estimates. Data reported in I-CARE only include doses administered in Illinois and some doses administered outside of Illinois reported historically by Illinois providers. Doses administered by the federal Bureau of Prisons and Department of Defense are also not currently reported in I-CARE.

ShotSpotter audio sensors are placed in several CPD districts throughout the city (specific districts are noted below). If at least three sensors detect a sound that the ShotSpotter software determines to be potential gunfire, a location is determined and the alert is sent to human ShotSpotter analysts for review. Either the alert is sent to CPD, or it is dismissed. Each alert can contain multiple rounds of gunfire; sometimes there are multiple alerts for what may be determined to be one incident. More detail on the technology and its accuracy can be found on the company\u2019s website <a href=\"https://www.shotspotter.com\">here</a>.

We have also added age group columns for 0-17 and 18-64 and stopped updating the 5+ and 12+ columns, although previously published values remain for those columns. \n\nCOVID-19 vaccinations administered to Chicago residents based on the home ZIP Code of the person vaccinated, as provided by the medical provider in the Illinois Comprehensive Automated Immunization Registry Exchange (I-CARE). The ZIP Code where a person lives is not necessarily the same ZIP Code where the vaccine was administered. \n\nDefinitions: \n\u00b7People with at least one vaccine dose: Number of people who have received at least one dose of any COVID-19 vaccine, including the single-dose Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\u00b7People with a completed vaccine series: Number of people who have completed a primary COVID-19 vaccine series. Requirements vary depending on age and type of primary vaccine series received. \n\n\u00b7People with a bivalent dose: Number of people who received a bivalent (updated) dose of vaccine. Updated, bivalent doses became available in Fall 2022 and were created with the original strain of COVID-19 and newer Omicron variant strains.\n\n\u00b7Total doses administered: Number of all COVID-19 vaccine doses administered.\n\nData Notes:\nDaily counts are shown for the total number of doses administered, number of people with at least one vaccine dose, number of people who have a completed vaccine series, and number of people who have received a bivalent dose. Cumulative totals for each measure as of that date are also provided. Vaccinations are counted based on the day the vaccine was administered.\n\nCoverage percentages are calculated based on cumulative number of people who have received at least one vaccine dose, cumulative number of people who have a completed vaccine series, and cumulative number of people who have received a bivalent dose  in each ZIP Code.\n\nPopulation counts are from the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 2015-2019 5-year estimates and can be seen in the ZIP Code, 2019 rows of the Chicago Population Counts dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/85cm-7uqa).\n\nActual counts may exceed population estimates and lead to >100% coverage, especially in areas with small population sizes. Additionally, the medical provider may report a work address or incorrect home address for the person receiving the vaccination which may lead to over or under estimates of vaccination coverage by geography.\u202f\n\nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received and it is, in fact, very common for recent dates to be incomplete and to be updated as time goes on.

Population counts are from the 2020 U.S. Decennial Census. Actual counts may exceed population estimates and lead to >100% coverage, especially in small race-ethnicity subgroups of each age group within an HCEZ.\u202fAll coverage percentages are capped at 99%. Summing all race/ethnicity group populations to obtain citywide populations may provide a population count that differs slightly from the citywide population count listed in the dataset. Differences in these estimates are due to how community area populations are calculated.   \n\nWeekly cumulative counts and coverage percentages are reported from the week ending Saturday, September 16, 2023 onward through the Saturday prior to the dataset being updated. \n\nAll data are provisional and subject to change.

For surveillance purposes, up to date is defined based on the following criteria: \n\nPeople ages 5 years and older: \n\u00b7 Are up to date when they receive a single dose of an updates (2023-2024 formula) vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or Novavax) regardless of their prior vaccination history \n\nChildren aged 6 months to 4 years: \n\u00b7 Children who have received at least two prior COVID-19 vaccine doses are up to date when they receive one additional dose of updated COVID-19 vaccine (2023-2024 formula), regardless of vaccine product. \n\u00b7 Children who have received only one prior COVID-19 vaccine dose are up to date when they receive one additional dose of updated Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (2023-2024 formula) or two additional doses of updated Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (2023-2024 formula). \n\u00b7 Children who have never received a COVID-19 vaccination are up to date when they receive either two doses of the updated Moderna vaccine (2023-2024 formula) or three doses of the updated Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (2023-2024 formula) \n\nThis dataset takes the place of two previous datasets, which cover doses administered from December 15, 2020 through September 13, 2023 and will be marked as historical shortly after the launch of this dataset:\n- https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/COVID-19-Daily-Vaccinations-Chicago-Residents/2vhs-cf6b\n- https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/COVID-19-Vaccinations-by-Age-and-Race-Ethnicity/37ac-bbe3.\n\nData Notes:\n\nWeekly cumulative totals of people up to date are shown for each combination of race-ethnicity, sex, and age group. Note that race-ethnicity, age, and sex all have an option for \u201cAll\u201d so care should be taken when summing rows. \n\nCoverage percentages are calculated based on the cumulative number of people in each race-ethnicity/age/sex population subgroup who are considered up to date as of the week ending date divided by the estimated number of people in that subgroup. Population counts are obtained from the 2020 U.S. Decennial Census. Actual counts may exceed population estimates and lead to coverage estimates that are greater than 100%, especially in smaller demographic groupings with smaller populations. Additionally, the medical provider may report incorrect demographic information for the person receiving the vaccination, which may lead to over- or underestimation of vaccination coverage. All coverage percentages are capped at 99%. \n\nWeekly cumulative counts and coverage percentages are reported from the week ending Saturday, September 16, 2023 onward through the Saturday prior to the dataset being updated. \n\nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received and it is, in fact, very common for recent dates to be incomplete and to be updated as time goes on.

This dataset should be used in conjunction with the traffic Crash and People dataset available in the portal. \u201cVehicle\u201d information includes motor vehicle and non-motor vehicle modes of transportation, such as bicycles and pedestrians. Each mode of transportation involved in a crash is a \u201cunit\u201d and get one entry here. Each vehicle, each pedestrian, each motorcyclist, and each bicyclist is considered an independent unit that can have a trajectory separate from the other units. However, people inside a vehicle including the driver do not have a trajectory separate from the vehicle in which they are travelling and hence only the vehicle they are travelling in get any entry here. This type of identification of \u201cunits\u201d is needed to determine how each movement affected the crash. Data for occupants who do not make up an independent unit, typically drivers and passengers, are available in the People table. Many of the fields are coded to denote the type and location of damage on the vehicle. Vehicle information can be linked back to Crash data using the \u201cCRASH_RECORD_ID\u201d field. Since this dataset is a combination of vehicles, pedestrians, and pedal cyclists not all columns are applicable to each record.

Rates for boosted begin the week ending October 23, 2021 after booster shots were recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for adults 65+ years old and adults in certain populations and high risk occupational and institutional settings who received Pfizer or Moderna for their primary series or anyone who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. \n\nChicago residency is based on home address, as reported in the Illinois Comprehensive Automated Immunization Registry Exchange (I-CARE) and Illinois National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (I-NEDSS).\n\nOutcomes:\n\u2022\tCases: People with a positive molecular (PCR) or antigen COVID-19 test result from an FDA-authorized COVID-19 test that was reported into I-NEDSS. A person can become re-infected with SARS-CoV-2 over time and so may be counted more than once in this dataset. Cases are counted by week the test specimen was collected.\n\u2022\tHospitalizations: COVID-19 cases who are hospitalized due to a documented COVID-19 related illness or who are admitted for any reason within 14 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Hospitalizations are counted by week of hospital admission.\n\u2022\tDeaths: COVID-19 cases who died from COVID-19-related health complications as determined by vital records or a public health investigation. Deaths are counted by week of death.\n\nVaccination status:\n\u2022\tFully vaccinated: Completion of primary series of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine at least 14 days prior to a positive test (with no other positive tests in the previous 45 days).\n\u2022\tBoosted: Fully vaccinated with an additional or booster dose of any FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine received at least 14 days prior to a positive test (with no other positive tests in the previous 45 days).\n\u2022\tUnvaccinated: No evidence of having received a dose of an FDA-authorized or approved vaccine prior to a positive test. \n\nCLARIFYING NOTE: Those who started but did not complete all recommended doses of an FDA-authorized or approved vaccine prior to a positive test (i.e., partially vaccinated) are excluded from this dataset.\n\nIncidence rates for fully vaccinated but not boosted people (Vaccinated columns) are calculated as total fully vaccinated but not boosted with outcome divided by cumulative fully vaccinated but not boosted at the end of each week.

Incidence rates for unvaccinated (Unvaccinated columns) are calculated as total unvaccinated with outcome divided by total population minus cumulative boosted, fully, and partially vaccinated at the end of each week. All rates are multiplied by 100,000. \n\nIncidence rate ratios (IRRs) are calculated by dividing the weekly incidence rates among unvaccinated people by those among fully vaccinated but not boosted and boosted people. \n\nOverall age-adjusted incidence rates and IRRs are standardized using the 2000 U.S. Census standard population.\n\nPopulation totals are from U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 1-year estimates for 2019. \n\nAll data are provisional and subject to change.

Many providers are not listed on the map because they will start by providing vaccine to their current patients before expanding to others. Your first contact should be your health care provider, including your primary care provider, health clinic, or hospital where you have gotten medical care in the past. Check your provider\u2019s website, electronic application (e.g., MyChart), or office recorded message for details on vaccine availability. Providers are also reaching out directly to schedule appointments with their existing patients, prioritizing those who are older with more underlying conditions. Check the details associated with each provider prior to calling or showing up at the office or pharmacy.\n\nThere is a phased roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccine in Chicago with a very limited supply, so certain groups are prioritized. Currently, vaccination is available by appointment only for eligible individuals.

Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes.

CDOT receives reports of potholes through the 311 call center and uses a computerized mapping and tracking system to identify pothole locations and efficiently schedule crews.  One call to 311 can generate multiple pothole repairs. When a crew arrives to repair a 311 pothole, it fills all the other potholes within the block.  Pothole repairs are generally completed within 7 days from the first report of a pothole to 311. Weather conditions, particularly frigid temps and precipitation, influence how long a repair takes.  On days when weather is cooperative and there is no precipitation, crews can fill several thousand potholes.  \n\nIf a previous request is already open for a buffer of 4 addresses the request is given the status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".  For example, if there is an existing CSR for 6535 N Western and a new request is received for 6531 N Western (which is within four addresses of the original CSR) then the new request is given a status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".\n\nOnce the street is repaired, the status in CSR will read \u201cCompleted\u201d for the original request and \"Duplicate (Closed)\" for any duplicate requests.  A service request also receives the status of \u201cCompleted\u201d when the reported address is inspected but no potholes are found or have already been filled.  If another issue is found with the street, such as a \u201ccave-in\u201d or \u201cfailed utility cut\u201d, then it is directed to the appropriate department or contractor. \n\nData Owner: Transportation.

{"resource": {"name": "Traffic Crashes - Crashes", "id": "85ca-t3if", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Crash data shows information about each traffic crash on city streets within the City of Chicago limits and under the jurisdiction of Chicago Police Department (CPD). Data are shown as is from the electronic crash reporting system (E-Crash) at CPD, excluding any personally identifiable information. Records are added to the data portal when a crash report is finalized or when amendments are made to an existing report in E-Crash. Data from E-Crash are available for some police districts in 2015, but citywide data are not available until September 2017. About half of all crash reports, mostly minor crashes, are self-reported at the police district by the driver(s) involved and the other half are recorded at the scene by the police officer responding to the crash. Many of the crash parameters, including street condition data, weather condition, and posted speed limits, are recorded by the reporting officer based on best available information at the time, but many of these may disagree with posted information or other assessments on road conditions. If any new or updated information on a crash is received, the reporting officer may amend the crash report at a later time. A traffic crash within the city limits for which CPD is not the responding police agency, typically crashes on interstate highways, freeway ramps, and on local roads along the City boundary, are excluded from this dataset.\n\nAll crashes are recorded as per the format specified in the Traffic Crash Report, SR1050, of the Illinois Department of Transportation. The crash data published on the Chicago data portal mostly follows the data elements in SR1050 form. The current version of the SR1050 instructions manual with detailed information on each data elements is available <a href=\"https://idot.illinois.gov/Assets/uploads/files/Transportation-System/Manuals-Guides-&-Handbooks/Safety/Illinois Traffic Crash Report SR 1050 Instruction Manual 2019.pdf\">here</a>.\n\nAs per Illinois statute, only crashes with a property damage value of $1,500 or more or involving bodily injury to any person(s) and that happen on a public roadway and that involve at least one moving vehicle, except bike dooring, are considered reportable crashes. However, CPD records every reported traffic crash event, regardless of the statute of limitations, and hence any formal Chicago crash dataset released by Illinois Department of Transportation may not include all the crashes listed here.\n\nChange 11/21/2023: We have removed the RD_NO (Chicago Police Department report number) for privacy reasons.", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "http://www.chicago.gov", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-06-26T15:36:03.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-10-19T22:02:56.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-12-13T16:58:25.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-06-26T15:36:03.000Z", "columns_name": ["LIGHTING_CONDITION", "ROADWAY_SURFACE_COND", "INTERSECTION_RELATED_I", "PHOTOS_TAKEN_I", "BEAT_OF_OCCURRENCE", "STATEMENTS_TAKEN_I", "DOORING_I", "ALIGNMENT", "LANE_CNT", "WORK_ZONE_I", "TRAFFICWAY_TYPE", "WORK_ZONE_TYPE", "WORKERS_PRESENT_I", "NUM_UNITS", "FIRST_CRASH_TYPE", "PRIM_CONTRIBUTORY_CAUSE", "MOST_SEVERE_INJURY", "INJURIES_TOTAL", "CRASH_DATE", "POSTED_SPEED_LIMIT", "TRAFFIC_CONTROL_DEVICE", "CRASH_TYPE", "CRASH_RECORD_ID", "INJURIES_FATAL", "DEVICE_CONDITION", "INJURIES_INCAPACITATING", "LONGITUDE", "INJURIES_NON_INCAPACITATING", "INJURIES_REPORTED_NOT_EVIDENT", "INJURIES_NO_INDICATION", "LOCATION", "INJURIES_UNKNOWN", "STREET_NAME", "CRASH_HOUR", "STREET_DIRECTION", "STREET_NO", "SEC_CONTRIBUTORY_CAUSE", "WEATHER_CONDITION", "NOT_RIGHT_OF_WAY_I", "CRASH_DAY_OF_WEEK", "REPORT_TYPE", "CRASH_MONTH", "LATITUDE", "ROAD_DEFECT", "DAMAGE", "HIT_AND_RUN_I", "DATE_POLICE_NOTIFIED", "Boundaries - ZIP Codes", "CRASH_DATE_EST_I"], "columns_field_name": ["lighting_condition", "roadway_surface_cond", "intersection_related_i", "photos_taken_i", "beat_of_occurrence", "statements_taken_i", "dooring_i", "alignment", "lane_cnt", "work_zone_i", "trafficway_type", "work_zone_type", "workers_present_i", "num_units", "first_crash_type", "prim_contributory_cause", "most_severe_injury", "injuries_total", "crash_date", "posted_speed_limit", "traffic_control_device", "crash_type", "crash_record_id", "injuries_fatal", "device_condition", "injuries_incapacitating", "longitude", "injuries_non_incapacitating", "injuries_reported_not_evident", "injuries_no_indication", "location", "injuries_unknown", "street_name", "crash_hour", "street_direction", "street_no", "sec_contributory_cause", "weather_condition", "private_property_i", "crash_day_of_week", "report_type", "crash_month", "latitude", "road_defect", "damage", "hit_and_run_i", "date_police_notified", ":@computed_region_rpca_8um6", "crash_date_est_i"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Point", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Light condition at time of crash, as determined by reporting officer", "Road surface condition, as determined by reporting officer", "A field observation by the police officer whether an intersection played a role in the crash.

This dataset was used by CPD analysts to create an assessment report in support of a consent decree executed between the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Illinois (OAG) and the City of Chicago. \n\nThe CPD is currently engaged in a reform process, as governed by that consent decree. A consent decree is a written settlement resolving a legal dispute. The OAG/City of Chicago consent decree includes detailed requirements organized into 11 core areas (e.g., use of force, accountability and transparency), collectively designed to create organizational change within CPD. To review the consent decree and learn more about the process, see the City of Chicago\u2019s police reform webpage: \n\nhttps://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/police-reform/home/consent-decree.html\n\nThis dataset is made available to the public pursuant to consent decree requirements described in Paragraph 79 and Paragraph 80. \n\nParagraph 79 of the consent decree states that:\nBy April 1, 2020, and every year thereafter, CPD will conduct an assessment of the relative frequency of all misdemeanor arrests and administrative notices of violation (\u201cANOVs\u201d) effectuated by CPD members of persons in specific demographic categories, including race and gender.  \n\nThen, the last sentence of Paragraph 80 states that: \nUpon completion of the assessment, CPD will publish the underlying data, excluding personal identifying information (e.g., name, address, contact information), via a publicly-accessible, web-based data platform. \n\nThis dataset was used by CPD analysts to create an assessment report pursuant to Paragraph 79. The report was designed to achieve compliance with Paragraph 79. Each record in the dataset shows information about an ANOV issued by a CPD member. An ANOV is a citation issued for violating a Municipal Code of Chicago ordinance. ANOV\u2019s are adjudicated by the City of Chicago Department of Administrative Hearings (DOAH). ANOV data are owned and housed by the Department of Administrative Hearings. CPD receives a daily data extraction from the DOAH data system, whereupon ANOV data is ingested into the CPD data system.\n\nTo request the aforementioned report contact the CPD Freedom of Information Act Section at https://home.chicagopolice.org/information/freedom-of-information-act-foia.. \n\nNOV NUMBER is the record identifier for the dataset. Each record in the dataset is a unique, unduplicated citation. \n\nUsers interested in learning more about how CPD handles ANOV citations can review the current policy, using the CPD Automated Directives system (http://directives.chicagopolice.org/directives/).

If a Position Control is 1, then employees and vacancies are displayed; if a Position Control is 0, then the total number of hours/months recorded is displayed.\r\n\r\nThis dataset follows the format of the equivalent datasets from past years except that  Division Code, Section Code, Subsection Code, and Position Control have changed from Number to Text (not all in the same year) in order to accommodate non-numeric values.\r\n\r\nFor more information about the budget process, visit the Budget Documents page: https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/obm/provdrs/budget.html.", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "http://www.chicago.gov/budget", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2022-10-05T15:38:14.000Z", "createdAt": "2022-09-30T19:47:26.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-10-05T15:38:14.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2022-09-30T20:07:27.000Z", "columns_name": ["SUB-SECTION DESCRIPTION", "FUND TYPE", "ORGANIZATION DESCRIPTION", "ORGANIZATION CODE", "DEPARTMENT CODE", "SECTION CODE", "SECTION DESCRIPTION", "SUBSECTION CODE", "SCHEDULE / GRADE", "POSITION CONTROL", "BUDGETED PAY RATE", "TOTAL BUDGETED AMOUNT", "TITLE CODE", "FUND DESCRIPTION", "DEPARTMENT DESCRIPTION", "BUDGETED UNIT", "DIVISION CODE", "FUND CODE", "DIVISION DESCRIPTION", "BARGAINING UNIT", "TITLE DESCRIPTION", "TOTAL BUDGETED UNIT"], "columns_field_name": ["sub_section_description", "fund_type", "organization_description", "organization_code", "department_code", "section_code", "section_description", "subsection_code", "schedule_grade", "position_control", "budgeted_pay_rate", "total_budgeted_amount", "title_code", "fund_description", "department_description", "budgeted_unit", "division_code", "fund_code", "division_description", "bargaining_unit", "title_description", "total_budgeted_unit"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{"align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {"align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "currency", "currencyStyle": "USD", "precision": "2", "align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "currency", "currencyStyle": "USD", "precision": "2", "align": "right"}, {"align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {"align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "align": "left"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "locked": false, "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2022-09-30T19:47:30.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Administration & Finance", "domain_tags": ["2023", "budget"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Metadata_Frequency", "value": "Data are updated annually"}, {"key": "Metadata_Data-Owner", "value": "Budget & Management"}, {"key": "Metadata_Time-Period", "value": "2023"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.cityofchicago.org", "license": "See Terms of Use"}, "permalink": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/d6ui-3yap", "link": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/Administration-Finance/Budget-2023-Budget-Recommendations-Positions-and-S/d6ui-3yap", "owner": {"id": "vewm-vupz", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Jonathan Levy"}, "creator": {"id": "vewm-vupz", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Jonathan Levy"}}

This dataset offers a clean, comprehensive view of the City's payroll information by employee.  \n\nAbout the Dataset:\nThis has been extracted from the City of Chicago's Financial Management and Purchasing System (FMPS).  \nFMPS is the system used to process all financial transactions made by the City of Chicago, ensuring accuracy and transparency in fiscal operations.\nThis dataset includes useful details like employee name, pay element, pay period, fund, appropriation, department, and job title. \n-----\nData Disclaimer:\nThe following data disclaimer governs your use of the dataset extracted from the Payroll Costing module of the City of Chicago's Financial Management and Purchasing System (FMPS) or (FMPS Payroll Costing).\n\nPoint-in-Time Extract:\nThe dataset provided herein, represents a point-in-time extract from the FMPS Payroll Costing module and may not reflect real-time or up-to-date data.\n\nFinancial Statement Disclaimer \u2013 Timeframe and Limitations:\nThis dataset is provided without audit. It is essential to note that this dataset is not a component of the City's Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR). As such, it remains preliminary and is subject to the end-of-year reconciliation process inherent to the City's annual financial procedures outlined in the ACFR.\n\nNote on Pay Elements:\nAll pay elements available in the FMPS Payroll Costing module have been included in this dataset. \nPreviously published datasets, such as \"Employee Overtime and Supplemental Earnings,\" contained only a subset of these pay elements.\n\nPayroll Period:\nThe dataset's timeframe is organized into 24 payroll periods. It is important to understand that these periods may or may not directly correspond to specific earnings periods.\n\nAggregating Data:\nThe CIty of Chicago often has employees with the same name (including middle initials).  It is vital to use the unique employee identifier code (EMPLOYEE DATASET ID) when aggregating at the employee level to avoid duplication. \n\nData Subject to Change:\nThis dataset is subject to updates and modifications due to the course of business, including activities such as canceling, adjusting, and reissuing checks.\n\nData Disclosure Exemptions:\nInformation disclosed in this dataset is subject to FOIA Exemption Act, 5 ILCS 140/7 (Link:https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/documents/000501400K7.htm)", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "https://www.chicago.gov", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-06-13T21:51:40.000Z", "createdAt": "2024-04-15T12:59:58.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-06-13T21:48:00.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-06-13T21:51:40.000Z", "columns_name": ["PAYROLL PERIOD", "TITLE CODE", "DEPARTMENT CODE", "FUND", "PAYROLL YEAR", "DEPARTMENT", "DEPARTMENT FUNCTION", "APPROPRIATION", "TITLE", "EMPLOYEE DATASET ID", "EMPLOYEE", "PAY ELEMENT", "FUND CODE", "AMOUNT", "FUND TYPE", "APPROPRIATION CODE"], "columns_field_name": ["payroll_period", "title_code", "department_code", "fund", "payroll_year", "department", "department_function", "appropriation", "title", "employee_dataset_id", "employee", "pay_element", "fund_code", "amount", "fund_type", "appropriation_code"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Payroll Period as a Number (1-24) for improved dataset usability.

Source data comes from the CPD Automated Arrest application. This electronic application is part of the CPD CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system, and is used to process arrests Department-wide.\n\nA more-detailed version of this dataset is available to media by request. To make a request, please email <a href=\"mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org?subject=Arrests Access Request\">dataportal@cityofchicago.org</a> with the subject line: <b>Arrests Access Request</b>. Access will require an account on this site, which you may create at https://data.cityofchicago.org/signup. New data fields may be added to this public dataset in the future. Requests for individual arrest reports or any other related data other than access to the more-detailed dataset should be directed to <a href=\"https://home.chicagopolice.org/services/adult-arrest-search/\">CPD</a>, through contact information on that site or a <a href=\"http://www.chicago.gov/foia\">Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)</a> request.\n\nThe data is limited to adult arrests, defined as any arrest where the arrestee was 18 years of age or older on the date of arrest. The data excludes arrest records expunged by CPD pursuant to the Illinois Criminal Identification Act (20 ILCS 2630/5.2). \n\nDepartment members use charges that appear in Illinois Compiled Statutes or Municipal Code of Chicago. Arrestees may be charged with multiple offenses from these sources. Each record in the dataset includes up to four charges, ordered by severity and with CHARGE1 as the most severe charge. Severity is defined based on charge class and charge type, criteria that are routinely used by Illinois court systems to determine penalties for conviction. In case of a tie, charges are presented in the order that the arresting officer listed the charges on the arrest report. By policy, Department members are provided general instructions to emphasize seriousness of the offense when ordering charges on an arrest report. \n\nEach record has an additional set of columns where a charge characteristic (statute, description, type, or class) for all four charges, or fewer if there were not four charges, is concatenated with the | character. These columns can be used with the Filter function's \"Contains\" operator to find all records where a value appears, without having to search four separate columns.\n\nUsers interested in learning more about CPD arrest processes can review current directives, using the CPD Automated Directives system (http://directives.chicagopolice.org/directives/).

The major difference in this dataset is that the case, death, and hospitalization corresponding rates per 100,000 population are not those for the single date indicated. They are rolling averages for the seven-day period ending on that date. This rolling average is used to account for fluctuations that may occur in the data, such as fewer cases being reported on weekends, and small numbers.  The intent is to give a more representative view of the ongoing COVID-19 experience, less affected by what is essentially noise in the data.\n\nAll rates are per 100,000 population in the indicated group, or Chicago, as a whole, for \u201cTotal\u201d columns.\n\nOnly Chicago residents are included based on the home address as provided by the medical provider.\n\nCases with a positive molecular (PCR) or antigen test are included in this dataset. Cases are counted based on the date the test specimen was collected. Deaths among cases are aggregated by day of death. Hospitalizations are reported by date of first hospital admission. Demographic data are based on what is reported by medical providers or collected by CDPH during follow-up investigation.\n\nDenominators are from the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 1-year estimate for 2018 and can be seen in the Citywide, 2018 row of the Chicago Population Counts dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/85cm-7uqa).\n\nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received and it is, in fact, very common for recent dates to be incomplete and to be updated as time goes on. At any given time, this dataset reflects cases and deaths currently known to CDPH.\n\nNumbers in this dataset may differ from other public sources due to definitions of COVID-19-related cases and deaths, sources used, how cases and deaths are associated to a specific date, and similar factors.\n\nData Source: Illinois National Electronic Disease Surveillance System, Cook County Medical

Newer records are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/sxs8-h27x. The most recent estimates for each region are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t2qc-9pjd.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.

(This is not a City of Chicago site. Please direct any questions or comments through the contact information on the site.) \n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) required EMS Region XI (Chicago area) hospitals to report hospital capacity and patient impact metrics related to COVID-19 to CDPH through the statewide EMResource system. This requirement has been lifted as of May 9, 2023, in alignment with the expiration of the national and statewide COVID-19 public health emergency declarations on May 11, 2023. However, all hospitals will still be required by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to report COVID-19 hospital capacity and utilization metrics into the HHS Protect system through the CDC\u2019s National Healthcare Safety Network until April 30, 2024. Facility-level data from the HHS Protect system can be found at healthdata.gov.   \n\nUntil May 9, 2023, all Chicago (EMS Region XI) hospitals (n=28) were required to report bed and ventilator capacity, availability, and occupancy to the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) daily. A list of reporting hospitals is included below. All data represent hospital status as of 11:59 pm for that calendar day. Counts include Chicago residents and non-residents. \n \nICU bed counts include both adult and pediatric ICU beds. Neonatal ICU beds are not included. Capacity refers to all staffed adult and pediatric ICU beds. Availability refers to all available/vacant adult and pediatric ICU beds. Hospitals began reporting COVID-19 confirmed and suspected (PUI) cases in ICU on 03/19/2020. Hospitals began reporting ICU surge capacity as part of total capacity on 5/18/2020. \n \nAcute non-ICU bed counts include burn unit, emergency department, medical/surgery (ward), other, pediatrics (pediatric ward) and psychiatry beds. Burn beds include those approved by the American Burn Association or self-designated. Capacity refers to all staffed acute non-ICU beds. An additional 500 acute/non-ICU beds were added at the McCormick Place Treatment Facility on 4/15/2020. These beds are not included in the total capacity count. The McCormick Place Treatment Facility closed on 05/08/2020. Availability refers to all available/vacant acute non-ICU beds. Hospitals began reporting COVID-19 confirmed and suspected (PUI) cases in acute non-ICU beds on 04/03/2020. \n \nVentilator counts prior to 04/24/2020 include all full-functioning mechanical ventilators, with ventilators with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), anesthesia machines, and portable/transport ventilators counted as surge. Beginning 04/24/2020, ventilator counts include all full-functioning mechanical ventilators, BiPAP, anesthesia machines and portable/transport ventilators. Ventilators are counted regardless of ability to staff. Hospitals began reporting COVID-19 confirmed and suspected (PUI) cases on ventilators on 03/19/2020. CDPH has access to additional ventilators from the EAMC (Emergency Asset Management Center) cache.

The law, which phases in from 2014-2017, covers less than 1% of Chicago\u2019s buildings, which account for approximately 20% of total energy used by all buildings. For more details, including ordinance text, rules and regulations, and timing, please visit www.CityofChicago.org/EnergyBenchmarking.\r\n\r\nNote that the ordinance authorizes the City to make individual building data readily-available to the public, beginning with the second year in which a building is covered. The Covered Buildings List is distinct from the publicly-shared energy use data, and does not include energy use or any other information reported in the benchmarking process. For the building-specific energy use dataset, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/xq83-jr8c.\r\n\r\nIf your property is on this list, and you do not believe you are covered by the ordinance, please submit the appropriate online exemption form at: www.CityofChicago.org/EnergyBenchmarking. If your property is not on the list, and it meets the compliance criteria, please check for any alternative building addresses. If the building is still not found, please submit the Building ID Request Form (http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/iframe/Benchmarking_ID_Request.html). The Chicago Energy Benchmarking Help Center can assist with any other questions, and can be reached at (855)858-6878, or by email: Info@ChicagoEnergyBenchmarking.org.\r\n\r\nThis dataset will be refreshed periodically as additional information becomes available.

{"resource": {"name": "Violence Reduction - Victim Demographics - Aggregated", "id": "gj7a-742p", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This dataset contains aggregate data on violent index victimizations at the quarter level of each year (i.e., January \u2013 March, April \u2013 June, July \u2013 September, October \u2013 December), from 2001 to the present (1991 to present for Homicides), with a focus on those related to gun violence. Index crimes are 10 crime types selected by the FBI (codes 1-4) for special focus due to their seriousness and frequency. This dataset includes only those index crimes that involve bodily harm or the threat of bodily harm and are reported to the Chicago Police Department (CPD). Each row is aggregated up to victimization type, age group, sex, race, and whether the victimization was domestic-related. Aggregating at the quarter level provides large enough blocks of incidents to protect anonymity while allowing the end user to observe inter-year and intra-year variation. Any row where there were fewer than three incidents during a given quarter has been deleted to help prevent re-identification of victims. For example, if there were three domestic criminal sexual assaults during January to March 2020, all victims associated with those incidents have been removed from this dataset. Human trafficking victimizations have been aggregated separately due to the extremely small number of victimizations.\r\n\r\nThis dataset includes a \" GUNSHOT_INJURY_I \" column to indicate whether the victimization involved a shooting, showing either Yes (\"Y\"), No (\"N\"), or Unknown (\"UKNOWN.\") For homicides, injury descriptions are available dating back to 1991, so the \"shooting\" column will read either \"Y\" or \"N\" to indicate whether the homicide was a fatal shooting or not. For non-fatal shootings, data is only available as of 2010. As a result, for any non-fatal shootings that occurred from 2010 to the present, the shooting column will read as \u201cY.\u201d Non-fatal shooting victims will not be included in this dataset prior to 2010; they will be included in the authorized dataset, but with \"UNKNOWN\" in the shooting column.\r\n\r\nThe dataset is refreshed daily, but excludes the most recent complete day to allow CPD time to gather the best available information. Each time the dataset is refreshed, records can change as CPD learns more about each victimization, especially those victimizations that are most recent. The data on the Mayor's Office Violence Reduction Dashboard is updated daily with an approximately 48-hour lag. As cases are passed from the initial reporting officer to the investigating detectives, some recorded data about incidents and victimizations may change once additional information arises. Regularly updated datasets on the City's public portal may change to reflect new or corrected information.\r\n\r\nHow does this dataset classify victims?\r\n\r\nThe methodology by which this dataset classifies victims of violent crime differs by victimization type:\r\n\r\nHomicide and non-fatal shooting victims: A victimization is considered a homicide victimization or non-fatal shooting victimization depending on its presence in CPD's homicide victims data table or its shooting victims data table. A victimization is considered a homicide only if it is present in CPD's homicide data table, while a victimization is considered a non-fatal shooting only if it is present in CPD's shooting data tables and absent from CPD's homicide data table. \r\n\r\nTo determine the IUCR code of homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, we defer to the incident IUCR code available in CPD's Crimes, 2001-present dataset (available on the City's open data portal). If the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes dataset is inconsistent with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization, we defer to CPD's Victims dataset. \r\n\r\nFor a criminal homicide, the only sensible IUCR codes are 0110 (first-degree murder) or 0130 (second-degree murder). For a non-fatal shooting, a sensible IUCR code must signify a criminal sexual assault, a robbery, or, most commonly, an aggravated battery.

This dataset includes a \"GUNSHOT_INJURY_I \" column to indicate whether the victimization involved a shooting, showing either Yes (\"Y\"), No (\"N\"), or Unknown (\"UKNOWN.\") For homicides, injury descriptions are available dating back to 1991, so the \"shooting\" column will read either \"Y\" or \"N\" to indicate whether the homicide was a fatal shooting or not. For non-fatal shootings, data is only available as of 2010. As a result, for any non-fatal shootings that occurred from 2010 to the present, the shooting column will read as \u201cY.\u201d Non-fatal shooting victims will not be included in this dataset prior to 2010; they will be included in the authorized-access dataset, but with \"UNKNOWN\" in the shooting column.\r\n\r\nEach row represents a single victimization, i.e., a unique event when an individual became the victim of a homicide or non-fatal shooting. Each row does not represent a unique victim\u2014if someone is victimized multiple times there will be multiple rows for each of those distinct events. \r\n\r\nThe dataset is refreshed daily, but excludes the most recent complete day to allow the Chicago Police Department (CPD) time to gather the best available information. Each time the dataset is refreshed, records can change as CPD learns more about each victimization, especially those victimizations that are most recent. The data on the Mayor's Office Violence Reduction Dashboard is updated daily with an approximately 48-hour lag. As cases are passed from the initial reporting officer to the investigating detectives, some recorded data about incidents and victimizations may change once additional information arises. Regularly updated datasets on the City's public portal may change to reflect new or corrected information.\r\n\r\nA version of this dataset with additional crime types is available by request.

Access will require an account on this site, which you may create at https://data.cityofchicago.org/signup.\r\n\r\nHow does this dataset classify victims?\r\n\r\nThe methodology by which this dataset classifies victims of violent crime differs by victimization type:\r\n\r\nHomicide and non-fatal shooting victims: A victimization is considered a homicide victimization or non-fatal shooting victimization depending on its presence in CPD's homicide victims data table or its shooting victims data table. A victimization is considered a homicide only if it is present in CPD's homicide data table, while a victimization is considered a non-fatal shooting only if it is present in CPD's shooting data tables and absent from CPD's homicide data table.\r\n\r\nTo determine the IUCR code of homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, we defer to the incident IUCR code available in CPD's Crimes, 2001-present dataset (available on the City's open data portal). If the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes dataset is inconsistent with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization, we defer to CPD's Victims dataset. \r\nFor a criminal homicide, the only sensible IUCR codes are 0110 (first-degree murder) or 0130 (second-degree murder). For a non-fatal shooting, a sensible IUCR code must signify a criminal sexual assault, a robbery, or, most commonly, an aggravated battery. In rare instances, the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes and Victims dataset do not align with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization:\r\n\r\n1.

Vision Zero is Chicago\u2019s commitment to eliminating fatalities and serious injuries from traffic crashes. The VZC Traffic Fatality List is compiled by the Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) after monthly reviews of fatal traffic crash information provided by Chicago Police Department\u2019s Major Accident Investigation Unit (MAIU).\n\nCDOT uses a standardized process \u2013 sometimes differing from other sources and everyday use of the term -- to determine whether a death is a \u201ctraffic fatality.\u201d Therefore, the traffic fatalities included in this list may differ from the fatal crashes reported in the full Traffic Crashes dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/85ca-t3if).\n\nOfficial traffic crash data are published by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) on an annual basis. This VZC Traffic Fatality List is updated monthly. Once IDOT publishes its crash data for a year, this dataset is edited to reflect IDOT\u2019s findings. \n\nVZC Traffic Fatalities can be linked with other traffic crash datasets using the \u201cPerson_ID\u201d field.\n\nState of Illinois considers a \u201ctraffic fatality\u201d as any death caused by a traffic crash involving a motor vehicle, within 30 days of the crash. Fatalities that meet this definition are included in this VZC Traffic Fatality List unless excluded by any criteria below. There may be records in this dataset that do not appear as fatalities in the other datasets.\n\nThe following criteria exclude a death from being considered a \"traffic fatality,\" and are derived from Federal and State reporting standards. \n\n1. The Medical Examiner determined that the primary cause of the fatality was not the traffic crash, including:\n\na. The fatality was reported as a suicide based on a police investigation.\n\nb. The fatality was reported as a homicide in which the \"party at fault\" intentionally inflicted serious bodily harm that caused the victim's death.\n\nc. The fatality was caused directly and exclusively by a medical condition or the fatality was not attributable to road user movement on a public roadway. (Note: If a person driving suffers a medical emergency and consequently hits and kills another road user, the other road user is included, although the driver suffering a medical emergency is excluded.)\n\n2. The crash did not occur within a trafficway.\n\n3. The crash involved a train or other such mode of transport within the rail dedicated right-of-way.\n\n4. The fatality was on a roadway not under Chicago Police Department jurisdiction, including:\n\na. The fatality was occurred on an expressway. The City of Chicago does not have oversight on the expressway system. However, a fatality on expressway ramps occurring within the City jurisdiction will be counted in VZC Traffic Fatality List.\n\nb. The fatality occurred outside City limits.

{"resource": {"name": "Chicago Traffic Tracker - Historical Congestion Estimates by Region - 2018-Current", "id": "kf7e-cur8", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This dataset contains the historical estimated congestion for the 29 traffic regions, starting in approximately March 2018. Older records are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/emtn-qqdi. The most recent estimates for each segment are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t2qc-9pjd.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves.

{"resource": {"name": "Chicago Traffic Tracker - Congestion Estimates by Segments", "id": "n4j6-wkkf", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This dataset contains the current estimated speed for about 1250 segments covering 300 miles of arterial roads. For a more detailed description, go to: http://bit.ly/Q9AZAD. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (nonfreeway\r\nstreets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every ten minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimate by traffic segments gives the observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic.\r\n\r\nTraffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area).\r\nThis dataset contains the current estimated speed for about 1250 segments covering 300 miles of arterial roads.\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent\r\nintersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes.

The recommended dataset to use in its place is https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/COVID-19-Vaccination-Coverage-Region-HCEZ-/5sc6-ey97.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccinations administered to Chicago residents by Healthy Chicago Equity Zones (HCEZ) based on the reported address, race-ethnicity, and age group of the person vaccinated, as provided by the medical provider in the Illinois Comprehensive Automated Immunization Registry Exchange (I-CARE).\n\nHealthy Chicago Equity Zones is an initiative of the Chicago Department of Public Health to organize and support hyperlocal, community-led efforts that promote health and racial equity. Chicago is divided into six HCEZs. Combinations of Chicago\u2019s 77 community areas make up each HCEZ, based on geography.  For more information about HCEZs including which community areas are in each zone see: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Healthy-Chicago-Equity-Zones/nk2j-663f  \n\nVaccination Status Definitions:\n\n\u00b7People with at least one vaccine dose: Number of people who have received at least one dose of any COVID-19 vaccine, including the single-dose Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\u00b7People with a completed vaccine series: Number of people who have completed a primary COVID-19 vaccine series. Requirements vary depending on age and type of primary vaccine series received.\n\n\u00b7People with a bivalent dose: Number of people who received a bivalent (updated) dose of vaccine. Updated, bivalent doses became available in Fall 2022 and were created with the original strain of COVID-19 and newer Omicron variant strains.\n\nWeekly cumulative totals by vaccination status are shown for each combination of race-ethnicity and age group within an HCEZ. Note that each HCEZ has a row where HCEZ is \u201cCitywide\u201d and each HCEZ has a row where age is \"All\" so care should be taken when summing rows.\n\nVaccinations are counted based on the date on which they were administered. Weekly cumulative totals are reported from the week ending Saturday, December 19, 2020 onward (after December 15, when vaccines were first administered in Chicago) through the Saturday prior to the dataset being updated.\n\nPopulation counts are from the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey (ACS) 2017-2021 5-year estimates. \n\nCoverage percentages are calculated based on the cumulative number of people in each population subgroup (age group by race-ethnicity within an HCEZ) who have each vaccination status as of the date, divided by the estimated number of people in that subgroup.\n\nActual counts may exceed population estimates and lead to >100% coverage, especially in small race-ethnicity subgroups of each age group within an HCEZ. <b>All coverage percentages are capped at 99%.</b>\n\nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received and it is, in fact, very common for recent dates to be incomplete and to be updated as time goes on. At any given time, this dataset reflects data currently known to CDPH.\n\nNumbers in this dataset may differ from other public sources due to when data are reported and how City of Chicago boundaries are defined.\n\nCDPH uses the most complete data available to estimate COVID-19 vaccination coverage among Chicagoans, but there are several limitations that impact its estimates. Data reported in I-CARE only includes doses administered in Illinois and some doses administered outside of Illinois reported historically by Illinois providers. Doses administered by the federal Bureau of Prisons and Department of Defense are also not currently reported in I-CARE. The Veterans Health Administration began reporting doses in I-CARE beginning September 2022.

The dataset has also been renamed.

ED data can include information that are collected before cases are diagnosed or laboratory results are confirmed, providing an early warning system for infections, like COVID-19. \n\nThis dataset includes reports of COVID-19-Like illness (CLI) and COVID-19 diagnosed during an ED visit. CLI is defined as fever and cough or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing with or without the presence of a coronavirus diagnosis code. Visits meeting the CLI definition that also have mention of flu or influenza are excluded. \n\nThis dataset also includes ED visits among persons who have been diagnosed or laboratory confirmed to have COVID-19. During the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic COVID-19 diagnoses counts are artificially low, due to varying eligibility requirements and availability of testing.\n\nOver the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, public health best practices migrated from focusing on CLI to focusing on diagnosed cases. This dataset originally contained only CLI columns. In June 2021, the diagnosis columns were added, back filled to the start of the pandemic but with the caveat noted above. Roughly simultaneously, updating of the CLI columns was discontinued, although previously existing data were kept. Reflecting the new columns, the name of the dataset was changed from \u201cCOVID-Like Illness (CLI) Emergency Department Visits\u201d to \u201cCOVID-Like Illness (CLI) and COVID-19 Diagnosis Emergency Department Visits\u201d at the same time.\n\nData Source: Illinois Hospital Emergency Departments reporting to CDPH through the National Syndromic Surveillance Project (NSSP)", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "https://chicago.gov/coronavirus", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-06-27T14:30:09.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-02-10T21:51:28.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-02-03T17:08:01.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-06-27T14:30:09.000Z", "columns_name": ["COVID Percent - Daily", "COVID Percent - 7 day average", "Total COVID - Daily", "Total CLI - Daily", "Date", "Total ED Visits - Daily", "COVID Count - 7 day average", "CLI Percent - 7 day average", "CLI Percent - Daily", "CLI Count - 7 day average"], "columns_field_name": ["covid_percent_daily", "covid_percent_7_day_average", "total_covid_daily", "total_cli_daily", "date", "total_ed_visits_daily", "covid_count_7_day_average", "cli_percent_7_day_average", "cli_percent_daily", "cli_count_7_day_average"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Percentage of ED visits that are COVID-19 diagnoses", "7-day rolling average of COVID-19 diagnosis percentage", "Total number of COVID-19 cases diagnosed in EDs on the date", "Total number of CLI ED visits on the date.", "Date of ED visit", "Total number of ED visits on the date.", "7-day rolling average of COVID-19 diagnosis counts", "7-day rolling average of CLI percentage", "Percentage of ED visits attributed to CLI", "7-day rolling average of CLI counts"], "columns_format": [{"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1", "precision": "1"}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1", "precision": "1"}, {}, {}, {"view": "date"}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1", "precision": "1"}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1", "precision": "1"}, {"precision": "0"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "locked": false, "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2021-06-23T17:38:08.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Health & Human Services", "domain_tags": ["covid-19", "health", "link to article present", "public health", "syndromic surveillance"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Metadata_Frequency", "value": "Data are updated daily."}, {"key": "Metadata_Data-Owner", "value": "Department of Public Health"}, {"key": "Metadata_Time-Period", "value": "Current through most recent date shown."}, {"key": "Metadata_Changes-and-Other-Historical-Information-Useful-to-Understanding-This-Dataset", "value": "http://dev.cityofchicago.org/open%20data/data%20portal/2021/06/23/covid-ed-visits-change.html"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.cityofchicago.org", "license": "See Terms of Use"}, "permalink": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/qwib-edaw", "link": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/COVID-Like-Illness-CLI-and-COVID-19-Diagnosis-Emer/qwib-edaw", "owner": {"id": "scy9-9wg4", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "cocadmin"}, "creator": {"id": "scy9-9wg4", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "cocadmin"}}

The most recent estimates for each segment are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/n4j6-wkkf.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials.\r\n\r\nCongestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nThe segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "https://www.cityofchicago.org", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-06-27T14:25:13.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-02-28T22:28:52.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2021-07-16T20:46:35.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-06-27T14:25:13.000Z", "columns_name": ["TIME", "SPEED", "FROM_STREET", "START_LONGITUDE", "TO_STREET", "END_LOCATION", "STREET", "START_LOCATION", "END_LATITUDE", "Wards", "END_LONGITUDE", "LENGTH", "Community Areas", "COMMENTS", "START_LATITUDE", "DAY_OF_WEEK", "BUS_COUNT", "STREET_HEADING", "RECORD_ID", "HOUR", "DIRECTION", "MESSAGE_COUNT", "Zip Codes", "MONTH", "SEGMENT_ID"], "columns_field_name": ["time", "speed", "from_street", "start_longitude", "to_street", "end_location", "street", "start_location", "end_latitude", ":@computed_region_43wa_7qmu", "end_longitude", "length", ":@computed_region_vrxf_vc4k", "comments", "start_latitude", "day_of_week", "bus_count", "street_heading", "record_id", "hour", "direction", "message_count", ":@computed_region_6mkv_f3dw", "month", "segment_id"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Point", "Text", "Point", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "Estimated traffic speed in miles per hour.

For a detailed description, go to: http://bitly.com/TeqrNv. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). \r\n\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-06-27T14:18:12.000Z", "createdAt": "2011-11-20T03:43:27.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-01-13T17:07:49.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-06-27T14:18:12.000Z", "columns_name": [" WEST", " SOUTH", " NORTH", " DESCRIPTION", "REGION", " REGION_ID", " CURRENT_SPEED", " EAST", " LAST_UPDATED"], "columns_field_name": ["_west", "_south", "_north", "_description", "region", "_region_id", "current_speed", "_east", "_last_updt"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Approximate longitude of the west edge of the region.", "Approximate latitude of the south edge of the region.", "Approximate latitude of the north edge of the region.", "Description of the region.", "Name of the region.", "Unique arbitrary number to represent each region.", "Estimated congestion level.

(See City Council Meeting schedule: https://chicago.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx.)  The collection of street segments for a single zone (collectively identified by Zone number) are not required to constitute a seamless polygon; however, they must be contiguous; in this sense, \u201cZones\u201d often closer resemble a collection of intersecting segments rather than an unbroken area. Segments are commonly categorized as being either \u201cStandard\u201d or \u201cBuffer\u201d: Standard means that signs exist on the street segment beginning at the low-point and ending at the high-point; Buffer means that physical signs do not exist for that zone on that physical street, but residents of addresses within that segment shall have the privilege to purchase zone products (daily permits and annual passes) for that zone, as if physical signs were installed.  (In this way, segments designated as \u2018Buffer\u2019 can in fact overlap with either other buffers and/or standard segments.)  Physical signs will display the zone number and the day/times when the zone restriction is in effect, e.g., \u201cAll Times\u201d / \u201cAnytime\u201d; \u201cMonday through Friday\u201d; \u201c6am \u2013 6pm All Days.\u201d  During restricted days/times, any vehicle parked in the zone which does not display a valid unexpired zone product (either a daily permit or an annual pass printed on the City Vehicle Sticker) is subject to ticketing/enforcement.

This dataset also includes AST records from the historic DOE and pre-1992 UST records from the Building Department. \r\nData fields requiring description are detailed below. \r\nMAPPED LOCATION: Contains latitude/longitude coordinates of the site as determined through the Chicago Open Data Portal\u2019s geocoding engine. In instances where the facility address is a range, the lower number (the value in the \u201cStreet Number From\u201d column) is used for geocoding. For example, for the range address 1000-1005 S Wabash Ave, the Mapped Location would be the coordinates for 1000 S Wabash Ave. \r\n TANK TYPE:  Specifies if the asset is an Underground Storage Tank or an Aboveground Storage Tank.  \r\nFACILITY ID: This is the unique identifier of the facility. A UST Facility ID that is seven digits long and begins with the number \u20182\u2019 is a Facility ID assigned by the Office of the State Fire Marshall (OSFM). All other IDs were assigned by the DOE or CDPH based on the facility address.   \r\nOWNER: The owner of record for the tank. For State-regulated USTs, this is the owner registered with the OSFM. \r\nFACILITY NAME: This is the name given to the facility. This is usually the company/owner name, building name or address.  \r\nTANK ID: This is a numeric ID that uniquely identifies a particular tank at the facility. \r\nTANK MATERIAL: Specifies the type of material the tank is made of. \r\nTANK PRODUCT: Specifies the type of product stored in the tank.    \r\nTANK CAPACITY: This is the storage volume of the tank in gallons. \r\nINSTALLATION DATE: The date the tank was installed at the facility if known. For some records, this information is in the COMMENTS column.\r\nREMOVAL DATE: The date the tank was removed from the facility if known.  For some records, this information is in the COMMENTS column.\r\nLAST USED DATE: The date the tank was last in service if known.  For some records, this information is in the COMMENTS column.\r\nCOMMENT: Contains additional information on the tank that may include supplemental location information; field observations; removal, abandonment, or last used dates; permitting notes; and other miscellaneous information. \r\nDATA SOURCE: The city department that collected the data.", "attribution": "Department of Public Health", "attribution_link": "http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdph.html", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2024-06-19T11:53:53.000Z", "createdAt": "2012-08-28T16:59:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2024-06-19T11:53:53.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2024-06-19T11:50:10.000Z", "columns_name": ["TANK TYPE", "DIRECTION", "COMMENT", "Community Areas", "REMOVAL DATE", "LOCATION", "ADDRESS", "Zip Codes", "LONGITUDE", "LAST USED DATE", "FACILITY ID", "DATA SOURCE", "OWNER", "FACILITY NAME", "LATITUDE", "Census Tracts", "Boundaries - ZIP Codes", "Wards", "Tank ID", "STREET NUMBER TO", "STREET NAME", "STREET TYPE", "TANK MATERIAL", "TANK CONSTRUCTION", "STREET NUMBER FROM", "TANK PRODUCT", "TANK CAPACITY", "INSTALLATION DATE"], "columns_field_name": ["tank_type", "direction", "comment", ":@computed_region_vrxf_vc4k", "removal_abandoned_date", "location", "address", ":@computed_region_6mkv_f3dw", "longitude", "last_used_date", "facility_id", "data_source", "applicant", "facility", "latitude", ":@computed_region_bdys_3d7i", ":@computed_region_rpca_8um6", ":@computed_region_43wa_7qmu", "tank_id", "street_number_to", "street_name", "street_type", "tank_material", "tank_construction", "street_number", "tank_product", "tank_capacity", "installation_date"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Calendar date", "Point", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "Removal or abandoned date", "", "", "", "", "", "", "City department that collected the data.", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "In Gallons unless otherwise specified in record.", ""], "columns_format": [{"align": "center"}, {"align": "center"}, {"align": "left"}, {}, {"view": "date", "align": "center"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"view": "date", "align": "center"}, {"align": "center"}, {"align": "left"}, {"align": "center"}, {"align": "center"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"align": "center"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "center"}, {"align": "center"}, {"align": "center"}, {"align": "center"}, {"align": "center"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "center"}, {"align": "center"}, {"align": "center"}, {"view": "date", "align": "center"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "locked": false, "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2024-06-19T11:53:53.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["environment", "economy", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Environment & Sustainable Development", "domain_tags": ["ast", "tanks", "ust"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Metadata_Frequency", "value": ""}, {"key": "Metadata_Data-Owner", "value": ""}, {"key": "Metadata_Time-Period", "value": ""}, {"key": "Metadata_Last-Updated-Date-via-Automated-Load", "value": ""}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.cityofchicago.org"}, "permalink": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/ug5u-hxnx", "link": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/Environment-Sustainable-Development/CDPH-Storage-Tanks/ug5u-hxnx", "owner": {"id": "e3v2-km8a", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Renante"}, "creator": {"id": "e3v2-km8a", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Renante"}}

If a Position Control is 1, then employees and vacancies are displayed; if a Position Control is 0, then the total number of hours/months recorded is displayed.\n\nThis dataset follows the format of the equivalent datasets from past years except that  Division Code, Section Code, Subsection Code, and Position Control have changed from Number to Text (not all in the same year) in order to accommodate non-numeric values.\n\nFor more information about the budget process, visit the Budget Documents page: https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/obm/provdrs/budget.html.", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "http://www.chicago.gov/budget", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-10-10T17:31:25.000Z", "createdAt": "2023-10-10T17:20:15.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-10-10T17:31:18.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-10-10T17:31:25.000Z", "columns_name": ["DIVISION DESCRIPTION", "TOTAL BUDGETED AMOUNT", "BUDGETED PAY RATE", "TOTAL BUDGETED UNIT", "SUB-SECTION DESCRIPTION", "SUBSECTION CODE", "SECTION DESCRIPTION", "SECTION CODE", "DIVISION CODE", "ORGANIZATION DESCRIPTION", "ORGANIZATION CODE", "FUND DESCRIPTION", "FUND CODE", "DEPARTMENT DESCRIPTION", "DEPARTMENT CODE", "TITLE DESCRIPTION", "TITLE CODE", "BARGAINING UNIT", "POSITION CONTROL", "BUDGETED UNIT", "SCHEDULE / GRADE", "FUND TYPE"], "columns_field_name": ["division_description", "total_budgeted_amount", "budgeted_pay_rate", "total_budgeted_unit", "sub_section_description", "subsection_code", "section_description", "section_code", "division_code", "organization_description", "organization_code", "fund_description", "fund_code", "department_description", "department_code", "title_description", "title_code", "bargaining_unit", "position_control", "budgeted_unit", "schedule_grade", "fund_type"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{"align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "currency", "currencyStyle": "USD", "precision": "2", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "currency", "currencyStyle": "USD", "precision": "2", "align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {"align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {"align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "locked": false, "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2023-10-10T17:20:21.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Administration & Finance", "domain_tags": ["2024", "budget"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Metadata_Frequency", "value": "Data are updated annually"}, {"key": "Metadata_Data-Owner", "value": "Budget & Management"}, {"key": "Metadata_Time-Period", "value": "2024"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.cityofchicago.org", "license": "See Terms of Use"}, "permalink": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/v9kx-pj2u", "link": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/Administration-Finance/Budget-2024-Budget-Recommendations-Positions-and-S/v9kx-pj2u", "owner": {"id": "vewm-vupz", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Jonathan Levy"}, "creator": {"id": "vewm-vupz", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Jonathan Levy"}}

Vulnerability is defined as a combination of sociodemographic factors, epidemiological factors\u200b, occupational factors\u200b, and cumulative COVID-19 burden. \n\nThe 10 components of the index include COVID-19 specific risk factors and outcomes and social factors known to be associated with social vulnerability in the context of emergency preparedness. The CCVI is derived from ranking values of the components by Chicago Community Area, then synthesizing them into a single composite weighted score.  The higher the score, the more vulnerable the geographic area.\n\nZIP Code CCVI is included to enable comparison with other COVID-19 data available on the Chicago Data Portal. Some elements of the CCVI are not available by ZIP Code. To create ZIP Code CCVI, the proportion of the ZIP Code population contributed by each Community Areas was determined. The apportioned populations were then weighted by the Community Area CCVI score and averaged to determine a ZIP Code CCVI score. \n\nThe COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI) is adapted and modified from a Surgo Ventures collaboration (https://precisionforcovid.org/ccvi) and the CDC Social Vulnerability Index\u200b.

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Cases, Tests, and Deaths by ZIP Code - Historical", "id": "yhhz-zm2v", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "NOTE: This dataset has been retired and marked as historical-only.\n\nOnly Chicago residents are included based on the home ZIP Code as provided by the medical provider. If a ZIP was missing or was not valid, it is displayed as \"Unknown\". \n \nCases with a positive molecular (PCR) or antigen test are included in this dataset. Cases are counted based on the week the test specimen was collected. For privacy reasons, until a ZIP Code reaches five cumulative cases, both the weekly and cumulative case counts will be blank. Therefore, summing the \u201cCases - Weekly\u201d column is not a reliable way to determine case totals. Deaths are those that have occurred among cases based on the week of death.\n \nFor tests, each test is counted once, based on the week the test specimen was collected. Tests performed prior to 3/1/2020 are not included. Test counts include multiple tests for the same person (a change made on 10/29/2020). PCR and antigen tests reported to Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) through electronic lab reporting are included. Electronic lab reporting has taken time to onboard and testing availability has shifted over time, so these counts are likely an underestimate of community infection.\n\nThe \u201cPercent Tested Positive\u201d columns are calculated by dividing the number of positive tests by the number of total tests . Because of the data limitations for the Tests columns, such as persons being tested multiple times as a requirement for employment, these percentages may vary in either direction from the actual disease prevalence in the ZIP Code. \n \nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received. \n\nTo compare ZIP Codes to Chicago Community Areas, please see http://data.cmap.illinois.gov/opendata/uploads/CKAN/NONCENSUS/ADMINISTRATIVE_POLITICAL_BOUNDARIES/CCAzip.pdf.

On January 1, 2012, the DOE was disbanded and all its inspection, permitting, and enforcement authorities were transferred to the CDPH.   \nData fields requiring description are detailed below. \nMAPPED LOCATION: Contains latitude/longitude coordinates of the site as determined through the Chicago Open Data Portal\u2019s geocoding engine. In instances where the facility address is a range, the lower number (the value in the \u201cStreet Number From\u201d column) is used for geocoding.
