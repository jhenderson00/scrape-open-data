If a ZIP was missing or was not valid, it is displayed as \"Unknown\". \r\n \r\nCases with a positive molecular (PCR) or antigen test are included in this dataset. Cases are counted based on the week the test specimen was collected. For privacy reasons, until a ZIP Code reaches five cumulative cases, both the weekly and cumulative case counts will be blank. Therefore, summing the \u201cCases - Weekly\u201d column is not a reliable way to determine case totals. Deaths are those that have occurred among cases based on the week of death.\r\n \r\nFor tests, each test is counted once, based on the week the test specimen was collected. Tests performed prior to 3/1/2020 are not included. Test counts include multiple tests for the same person (a change made on 10/29/2020). PCR and antigen tests reported to Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) through electronic lab reporting are included. Electronic lab reporting has taken time to onboard and testing availability has shifted over time, so these counts are likely an underestimate of community infection.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cPercent Tested Positive\u201d columns are calculated by dividing the number of positive tests by the number of total tests .

This dataset is historical-only.\n\nThe Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) oversees the patching of potholes on over 4,000 miles of arterial and residential streets in Chicago. CDOT receives reports of potholes through the 311 call center and uses a computerized mapping and tracking system to identify pothole locations and efficiently schedule crews.  One call to 311 can generate multiple pothole repairs. When a crew arrives to repair a 311 pothole, it fills all the other potholes within the block.  Pothole repairs are generally completed within 7 days from the first report of a pothole to 311. Weather conditions, particularly frigid temps and precipitation, influence how long a repair takes.  On days when weather is cooperative and there is no precipitation, crews can fill several thousand potholes.  \n\nIf a previous request is already open for a buffer of 4 addresses the request is given the status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".  For example, if there is an existing CSR for 6535 N Western and a new request is received for 6531 N Western (which is within four addresses of the original CSR) then the new request is given a status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".\n\nOnce the street is repaired, the status in CSR will read \u201cCompleted\u201d for the original request and \"Duplicate (Closed)\" for any duplicate requests.  A service request also receives the status of \u201cCompleted\u201d when the reported address is inspected but no potholes are found or have already been filled.

Source data comes from the CPD Automated Arrest application. This electronic application is part of the CPD CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system, and is used to process arrests Department-wide.\n\nA more-detailed version of this dataset is available to media by request. To make a request, please email <a href=\"mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org?subject=Arrests Access Request\">dataportal@cityofchicago.org</a> with the subject line: <b>Arrests Access Request</b>. Access will require an account on this site, which you may create at https://data.cityofchicago.org/signup. New data fields may be added to this public dataset in the future. Requests for individual arrest reports or any other related data other than access to the more-detailed dataset should be directed to <a href=\"https://home.chicagopolice.org/services/adult-arrest-search/\">CPD</a>, through contact information on that site or a <a href=\"http://www.chicago.gov/foia\">Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)</a> request.\n\nThe data is limited to adult arrests, defined as any arrest where the arrestee was 18 years of age or older on the date of arrest. The data excludes arrest records expunged by CPD pursuant to the Illinois Criminal Identification Act (20 ILCS 2630/5.2). \n\nDepartment members use charges that appear in Illinois Compiled Statutes or Municipal Code of Chicago. Arrestees may be charged with multiple offenses from these sources. Each record in the dataset includes up to four charges, ordered by severity and with CHARGE1 as the most severe charge. Severity is defined based on charge class and charge type, criteria that are routinely used by Illinois court systems to determine penalties for conviction. In case of a tie, charges are presented in the order that the arresting officer listed the charges on the arrest report. By policy, Department members are provided general instructions to emphasize seriousness of the offense when ordering charges on an arrest report. \n\nEach record has an additional set of columns where a charge characteristic (statute, description, type, or class) for all four charges, or fewer if there were not four charges, is concatenated with the | character. These columns can be used with the Filter function's \"Contains\" operator to find all records where a value appears, without having to search four separate columns.\n\nUsers interested in learning more about CPD arrest processes can review current directives, using the CPD Automated Directives system (http://directives.chicagopolice.org/directives/).

Each mode of transportation involved in a crash is a \u201cunit\u201d and get one entry here. Each vehicle, each pedestrian, each motorcyclist, and each bicyclist is considered an independent unit that can have a trajectory separate from the other units. However, people inside a vehicle including the driver do not have a trajectory separate from the vehicle in which they are travelling and hence only the vehicle they are travelling in get any entry here. This type of identification of \u201cunits\u201d is needed to determine how each movement affected the crash. Data for occupants who do not make up an independent unit, typically drivers and passengers, are available in the People table. Many of the fields are coded to denote the type and location of damage on the vehicle. Vehicle information can be linked back to Crash data using the \u201cCRASH_RECORD_ID\u201d field.

Older records are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/emtn-qqdi. The most recent estimates for each segment are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t2qc-9pjd.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.

{"resource": {"name": "Violence Reduction - Victims of Homicides and Non-Fatal Shootings", "id": "gumc-mgzr", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This dataset contains individual-level homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, including homicide data from 1991 to the present, and non-fatal shooting data from 2010 to the present (2010 is the earliest available year for shooting data). This dataset includes a \"GUNSHOT_INJURY_I \" column to indicate whether the victimization involved a shooting, showing either Yes (\"Y\"), No (\"N\"), or Unknown (\"UKNOWN.\") For homicides, injury descriptions are available dating back to 1991, so the \"shooting\" column will read either \"Y\" or \"N\" to indicate whether the homicide was a fatal shooting or not. For non-fatal shootings, data is only available as of 2010. As a result, for any non-fatal shootings that occurred from 2010 to the present, the shooting column will read as \u201cY.\u201d Non-fatal shooting victims will not be included in this dataset prior to 2010; they will be included in the authorized-access dataset, but with \"UNKNOWN\" in the shooting column.\n\nEach row represents a single victimization, i.e., a unique event when an individual became the victim of a homicide or non-fatal shooting. Each row does not represent a unique victim\u2014if someone is victimized multiple times there will be multiple rows for each of those distinct events. \n\nThe dataset is refreshed daily, but excludes the most recent complete day to allow the Chicago Police Department (CPD) time to gather the best available information. Each time the dataset is refreshed, records can change as CPD learns more about each victimization, especially those victimizations that are most recent. The data on the Mayor's Office Violence Reduction Dashboard is updated daily with an approximately 48-hour lag. As cases are passed from the initial reporting officer to the investigating detectives, some recorded data about incidents and victimizations may change once additional information arises. Regularly updated datasets on the City's public portal may change to reflect new or corrected information.\n\nA version of this dataset with additional crime types is available by request. To make a request, please email <a href=\"mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org?subject=Violence Reduction Victims Access Request\">dataportal@cityofchicago.org</a> with the subject line: <b>Violence Reduction Victims Access Request</b>. Access will require an account on this site, which you may create at https://data.cityofchicago.org/signup.\n\nHow does this dataset classify victims?\n\nThe methodology by which this dataset classifies victims of violent crime differs by victimization type:\n\nHomicide and non-fatal shooting victims: A victimization is considered a homicide victimization or non-fatal shooting victimization depending on its presence in CPD's homicide victims data table or its shooting victims data table. A victimization is considered a homicide only if it is present in CPD's homicide data table, while a victimization is considered a non-fatal shooting only if it is present in CPD's shooting data tables and absent from CPD's homicide data table.\n\nTo determine the IUCR code of homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, we defer to the incident IUCR code available in CPD's Crimes, 2001-present dataset (available on the City's open data portal). If the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes dataset is inconsistent with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization, we defer to CPD's Victims dataset. \nFor a criminal homicide, the only sensible IUCR codes are 0110 (first-degree murder) or 0130 (second-degree murder). For a non-fatal shooting, a sensible IUCR code must signify a criminal sexual assault, a robbery, or, most commonly, an aggravated battery. In rare instances, the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes and Victims dataset do not align with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization:\n\n1. In instances where a homicide victimization does not correspond to an IUCR code 0110 or 0130, we set the IUCR code to \"01XX\"  to indicate that the victimization was a homicide but we do not know whether it was a first-degree murder", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "https://www.chicago.gov", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-03-16T12:38:13.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-05-05T20:04:20.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2021-11-18T15:28:17.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-03-16T12:38:13.000Z", "columns_name": ["RACE", "Wards", "Police Districts", "AREA", "VICTIMIZATION_FBI_DESCR", "GUNSHOT_INJURY_I", "VICTIMIZATION_FBI_CD", "DAY_OF_WEEK", "HOMICIDE_VICTIM_FIRST_NAME", "DISTRICT", "VICTIMIZATION_IUCR_CD", "SEX", "INCIDENT_FBI_DESCR", "INCIDENT_FBI_CD", "UNIQUE_ID", "AGE", "MONTH", "STREET_OUTREACH_ORGANIZATION", "STATE_HOUSE_DISTRICT", "HOUR", "ZIP_CODE", "STATE_SENATE_DISTRICT", "COMMUNITY_AREA", "INCIDENT_IUCR_CD", "VICTIMIZATION_IUCR_SECONDARY", "HOMICIDE_VICTIM_MI", "HOMICIDE_VICTIM_LAST_NAME", "LOCATION", "BLOCK", "INCIDENT_PRIMARY", "BEAT", "LOCATION_DESCRIPTION", "UPDATED", "CASE_NUMBER", "DATE", "VICTIMIZATION_PRIMARY", "WARD", "INCIDENT_IUCR_SECONDARY", "LATITUDE", "LONGITUDE", "Police Beats", "Community Areas", "Boundaries - ZIP Codes"], "columns_field_name": ["race", ":@computed_region_43wa_7qmu", ":@computed_region_d9mm_jgwp", "area", "victimization_fbi_descr", "gunshot_injury_i", "victimization_fbi_cd", "day_of_week", "homicide_victim_first_name", "district", "victimization_iucr_cd", "sex", "incident_fbi_descr", "incident_fbi_cd", "unique_id", "age", "month", "street_outreach_organization", "state_house_district", "hour", "zip_code", "state_senate_district", "community_area", "incident_iucr_cd", "victimization_iucr_secondary", "homicide_victim_mi", "homicide_victim_last_name", "location", "block", "incident_primary", "beat", "location_description", "updated", "case_number", "date", "victimization_primary", "ward", "incident_iucr_secondary", "latitude", "longitude", ":@computed_region_d3ds_rm58", ":@computed_region_vrxf_vc4k", ":@computed_region_rpca_8um6"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Point", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Crime classification as outlined in the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR).

The Board has, since 2000, compiled and posted static lists of all lobbyists and their clients online. Previous policy did not require the Board of Ethics to prioritize the reporting of all data available from paper filings. From this point forward, the Board of Ethics will electronically compile more data about lobbyists and their activities and automatically report this information online.", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "http://www.cityofchicago.org", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2016-12-09T10:34:31.000Z", "createdAt": "2012-06-06T19:26:31.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2016-12-09T10:34:31.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2016-12-09T10:31:45.000Z", "columns_name": ["CORRESPONDENT FIRST NAME", "INCURRED EXPENSES?", "CLIENT CONTRACT DATE", "LISTED DEPARTMENT NAME", "REGISTRATION FILED DATE", "CLIENT STATE", "CLIENT ADDRESS 2", "CLIENT ADDRESS", "CLIENT NAME", "CORRESPONDENT EMAIL", "CORRESPONDENT FAX", "CORRESPONDENT ZIP", "CORRESPONDENT STATE", "CORRESPONDENT ADDRESS", "EMPLOYER FAX", "EMPLOYER CITY", "EMPLOYER NAME", "EMAIL", "LOBBYIST EMAIL", "LOBBYIST PHONE", "LOBBYIST ZIP", "LOBBYIST STATE", "LOBBYIST ADDRESS 2", "LOBBYIST ADDRESS", "LOBBYIST MIDDLE INITIAL", "LOBBYIST LAST NAME", "LOBBYIST ID", "CLIENT INDUSTRY", "EMPLOYER ZIP", "EMPLOYER ADDRESS 2", "LOBBYIST FAX", "LOBBYIST FIRST NAME", "OTHER LOBBIED DEPARTMENT NAME", "CLIENT CITY", "REGISTRATION VERSION", "CORRESPONDENT COUNTRY", "CORRESPONDENT CITY", "CORRESPONDENT SALUTATION", "CORRESPONDENT MIDDLE INITIAL", "EMPLOYER COUNTRY", "EMPLOYER STATE", "LOBBYIST COUNTRY", "FILING YEAR", "CLIENT OTHER INDUSTRY", "LOBBYIST TERMINATED DATE", "CORRESPONDENT ADDRESS 2", "CORRESPONDENT PHONE", "CORRESPONDENT LAST NAME", "CLIENT ZIP", "EMPLOYER PHONE", "WRITTEN AGREEMENT?", "EMPLOYER ADDRESS", "LOBBYIST CITY", "LOBBYIST SALUTATION", "CLIENT PHONE", "RECEIVED COMPENSATION?"], "columns_field_name": ["correspondent_first_name", "incured_expenses", "client_contract_date", "lobbied_department_name", "registration_filed_date", "client_state", "client_address_2", "client_address", "client_name", "correspondent_email", "correspondent_fax", "correspondent_zip", "correspondent_state", "correspondent_address", "employer_fax", "employer_city", "employer_name", "email", "lobbyist_email", "lobbyist_phone", "lobbyist_zip", "lobbyist_state", "lobbyist_address_2", "lobbyist_address", "lobbyist_middle_initial", "lobbyist_last_name", "lobbyist_id", "client_industry", "employer_zip", "employer_address_2", "lobbyist_fax", "lobbyist_first_name", "other_lobbied_department_name", "client_city", "registration_version", "correspondent_country", "correspondent_city", "correspondent_salutation", "correspondent_middle_initial", "employer_country", "employer_state", "lobbyist_country", "filing_year", "client_other_industry", "lobbyist_terminated_date", "correspondent_address_2", "correspondent_phone", "correspondent_last_name", "client_zip", "employer_phone", "written_agreement", "employer_address", "lobbyist_city", "lobbyist_salutation", "client_phone", "received_compensation"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "Indicates the answer to the following question on the Lobbyist Registration: Have you incurred or do you anticipate incurring expenses on behalf of this client, whether or not you are reimbursed?", "", "The name of the department which the registrant is expected to lobby.", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "Indicates whether there is a written or oral agreement in place.

Scores are calculated and placed on a scale ranging from 0 (extremely low risk) to 500 (extremely high risk). \n\nBased on this time frame\u2019s version of the Strategic Subject Algorithm, individuals with criminal records are ranked using eight attributes, not including race or sex. These attributes are: number of times being the victim of a shooting incident, age during the latest arrest, number of times being the victim of aggravated battery or assault, number of prior arrests for violent offenses, gang affiliation, number of prior narcotic arrests, trend in recent criminal activity and number of prior unlawful use of weapon arrests. \n\nPlease note that this data set includes fields that are not used to calculate SSL, for example, neither race nor sex are used in the Strategic Subject Algorithm.

ShotSpotter is a gunshot detection system designed to automatically determine the location of potential outdoor gunfire. ShotSpotter audio sensors are placed in several CPD districts throughout the city (specific districts are noted below). If at least three sensors detect a sound that the ShotSpotter software determines to be potential gunfire, a location is determined and the alert is sent to human ShotSpotter analysts for review. Either the alert is sent to CPD, or it is dismissed. Each alert can contain multiple rounds of gunfire; sometimes there are multiple alerts for what may be determined to be one incident. More detail on the technology and its accuracy can be found on the company\u2019s website <a href=\"https://www.shotspotter.com\">here</a>. It should also be noted that ShotSpotter alerts may increase year-over-year while gun violence did not necessarily increase accordingly because of improvements in detection sensors.\r\n\r\nShotSpotter does not exist in every CPD district, and it was not rolled out in every district at the same time.

Initial vaccines required two doses of vaccine to be administered over a period of time specific to each vaccine brand. At least one future vaccine only required one dose to be considered fully vaccinated. While these doses completed the series, additional doses have been approved for some situations and are included in the Total Doses columns.\r\n\r\nVaccinations are counted based on the day the vaccine was administered.  \r\n\r\nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received and it is, in fact, very common for recent dates to be incomplete and to be updated as time goes on. At any given time, this dataset reflects data currently known to CDPH. \r\n\r\nNumbers in this dataset may differ from other public sources due to when data are reported and how City of Chicago boundaries are defined.  \r\n\r\nFor information about the number of vaccine doses administrated to Chicago residents and number of residents considered fully vaccinated regardless of if they were vaccinated in Chicago, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/COVID-19-Daily-Vaccinations-Chicago-Residents/2vhs-cf6b.  \r\n\r\nFor all datasets related to COVID-19, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?limitTo=datasets&sortBy=alpha&tags=covid-19. \r\n\r\nData Source: Illinois Comprehensive Automated Immunization Registry Exchange (I-CARE)", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "https://chicago.gov/coronavirus", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-03-15T22:22:09.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-12-17T19:29:28.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-01-25T22:52:54.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-03-15T22:22:09.000Z", "columns_name": ["1st Dose - Cumulative - Unknown Residency", "2nd Dose - Cumulative  - Non-Chicago Resident", "Total Doses - Daily - Non-Chicago Resident", "1st Dose - Cumulative  - Non-Chicago Resident", "Total Doses - Daily - Chicago Resident", "Total Doses - Cumulative - Unknown Residency", "2nd Dose - Daily", "Total Doses - Cumulative - Chicago Resident", "2nd Dose - Cumulative", "2nd Dose - Cumulative- Unknown Residency", "1st Dose - Cumulative  - Chicago Resident", "Total Doses - Cumulative - Non-Chicago Resident", "1st Dose - Daily", "Total Doses - Daily - Unknown Residency", "Total Doses - Cumulative", "Date", "1st Dose - Daily - Unknown Residency", "2nd Dose - Daily - Unknown Residency", "Total Doses - Daily", "1st Dose - Daily - Chicago Resident", "1st Dose - Daily - Non-Chicago Resident", "2nd Dose - Daily - Non-Chicago Resident", "2nd Dose - Daily - Chicago Resident", "1st Dose - Cumulative", "2nd Dose - Cumulative  - Chicago Resident"], "columns_field_name": ["_1st_dose_cumulative_unknown_residency", "_2nd_dose_cumulative_non_chicago_resident", "total_doses_daily_non_chicago_resident", "_1st_dose_cumulative_non_chicago_resident", "total_doses_daily_chicago_resident", "total_doses_cumulative_unknown_residency", "_2nd_dose_daily", "total_doses_cumulative_chicago_resident", "_2nd_dose_cumulative_admin", "_2nd_dose_cumulative_unknown_residency", "_1st_dose_cumulative_chicago_resident", "total_doses_cumulative_non_chicago_resident", "_1st_dose_daily", "total_doses_daily_unknown_residency", "total_doses_cumulative", "date", "_1st_dose_daily_unknown_residency", "_2nd_dose_daily_unknown_residency", "total_doses_daily", "_1st_dose_daily_chicago_resident", "_1st_dose_daily_non_chicago_resident", "_2nd_dose_daily_non_chicago_resident", "_2nd_dose_daily_chicago_resident", "_1st_dose_cumulative", "_2nd_dose_cumulative_chicago_resident"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Total number of 1st doses administered through this date to people of unknown residency.", "Total number of 2nd doses administered through this date  to Non-Chicago residents.", "Total number of doses administered to Non-Chicago residents on the date.", "Total number of 1st doses administered through this date to Non-Chicago residents.", "Total number of doses administered to Chicago residents on the date.", "Total number of doses administered to people of unknown residency through the date.", "Number of 2nd doses administered on the date.", "Total number of doses administered to Chicago residents through the date.", "Total number of 2nd doses administered through the date.", "Total number of 2nd doses administered through this date to people of unknown residency.", "Total number of 1st doses administered through this date to Chicago residents.", "Total number of doses administered to Non-Chicago residents through the date.", "Number of 1st doses administered on the date.", "Total number of doses administered to people of unknown residency on the date.", "Total number of doses administered through the date.", "Date vaccine administered.

For each grouping of columns (Total, 1st Dose, and Series Completed), there is now a 5+ column. Care should be taken when summing values to avoid accidental double-counting.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccinations administered to Chicago residents based on the home ZIP Code of the person vaccinated, as provided by the medical provider in the Illinois Comprehensive Automated Immunization Registry Exchange (I-CARE). The ZIP Code where a person lives is not necessarily the same ZIP Code where the vaccine was administered. \n\nDefinitions: \n\u00b7People with at least one vaccine dose: Number of people who have received at least one dose of any COVID-19 vaccine, including the single-dose Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.\n\u00b7People with a completed vaccine series: Number of people who have completed a primary COVID-19 vaccine series. Requirements vary depending on age and type of primary vaccine series received.\n\u00b7Total doses administered: Number of all COVID-19 vaccine doses administered.\n\nDaily counts are shown for the total number of doses administered, number of people with at least one vaccine dose, and number of people who have a completed vaccine series. Cumulative totals for each measure as of that date are also provided. Vaccinations are counted based on the day the vaccine was administered.\n\nCoverage percentages are calculated based on cumulative number of people who have received at least one vaccine dose and cumulative number of people who have a completed vaccine series in each ZIP Code.\n\nPopulation counts are from the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 2015-2019 5-year estimates and can be seen in the ZIP Code, 2019 rows of the Chicago Population Counts dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/85cm-7uqa).\n\nActual counts may exceed population estimates and lead to >100% coverage, especially in areas with small population sizes. Additionally, the medical provider may report a work address or incorrect home address for the person receiving the vaccination which may lead to over or under estimates of vaccination coverage by geography.\u202f\n\nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received and it is, in fact, very common for recent dates to be incomplete and to be updated as time goes on. At any given time, this dataset reflects data currently known to CDPH.\n\nNumbers in this dataset may differ from other public sources due to when data are reported and how City of Chicago boundaries are defined.\n\nFor all datasets related to COVID-19, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?limitTo=datasets&sortBy=alpha&tags=covid-19.\n\nData Source: Illinois Comprehensive Automated Immunization Registry Exchange (I-CARE), U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "https://chicago.gov/coronavirus", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-03-15T22:03:25.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-12-17T15:34:56.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-01-25T22:49:49.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-03-15T22:03:25.000Z", "columns_name": ["1st Dose - Daily - Age 18+", "1st Dose - Daily - Age 12+", "Zip Code", "Zip Codes", "Community Areas", "Total Doses - Daily - Age 65+", "1st Dose - Daily - Age 5+", "Total Doses - Daily - Age 12+", "Vaccine Series Completed - Daily - Age 65+", "Census Tracts", "Vaccine Series Completed - Daily", "Total Doses - Daily - Age 5+", "Vaccine Series Completed - Daily - Age 12+", "Vaccine Series Completed - Daily - Age 18+", "Total Doses - Daily - Age 18+", "Population", "Boundaries - ZIP Codes", "Date", "Total Doses - Daily", "1st Dose - Cumulative", "1st Dose - Percent Population", "Vaccine Series Completed - Cumulative", "Vaccine Series Completed  - Percent Population", "1st Dose - Daily - Age 65+", "Row_ID", "1st Dose - Daily", "Wards", "Total Doses - Cumulative", "Vaccine Series Completed - Daily - Age 5+", "ZIP Code Location"], "columns_field_name": ["_1st_dose_daily_age_18_plus", "_1st_dose_daily_age_12_plus", "zip_code", ":@computed_region_6mkv_f3dw", ":@computed_region_vrxf_vc4k", "total_doses_daily_age_65_plus", "_1st_dose_daily_age_5_plus", "total_doses_daily_age_12_plus", "vaccine_series_completed_daily_age_65_plus", ":@computed_region_bdys_3d7i", "vaccine_series_completed_daily", "total_doses_daily_age_5_plus", "vaccine_series_completed_daily_age_12_plus", "vaccine_series_completed_daily_age_18_plus", "total_doses_daily_age_18_plus", "population", ":@computed_region_rpca_8um6", "date", "total_doses_daily", "_1st_dose_cumulative", "_1st_dose_percent_population", "vaccine_series_completed_cumulative", "vaccine_series_completed_percent_population", "_1st_dose_daily_age_65_plus", "row_id", "_1st_dose_daily", ":@computed_region_43wa_7qmu", "total_doses_cumulative", "vaccine_series_completed_daily_age_5_plus", "zip_code_location"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Point"], "columns_description": ["", "", "Home ZIP Code of the person vaccinated.", "This column was automatically created in order to record in what polygon from the dataset 'Zip Codes' (6mkv-f3dw) the point in column 'zip_code_location' is located.

Each mode of transportation involved in a crash is a \u201cunit\u201d and get one entry here. Each vehicle, each pedestrian, each motorcyclist, and each bicyclist is considered an independent unit that can have a trajectory separate from the other units. However, people inside a vehicle including the driver do not have a trajectory separate from the vehicle in which they are travelling and hence only the vehicle they are travelling in get any entry here. This type of identification of \u201cunits\u201d is needed to determine how each movement affected the crash. Data for occupants who do not make up an independent unit, typically drivers and passengers, are available in the People table. Many of the fields are coded to denote the type and location of damage on the vehicle. Vehicle information can be linked back to Crash data using the \u201cCRASH_RECORD_ID\u201d field.

Rates for boosted begin the week ending October 23, 2021 after booster shots were recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for adults 65+ years old and adults in certain populations and high risk occupational and institutional settings who received Pfizer or Moderna for their primary series or anyone who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. \r\n\r\nChicago residency is based on home address, as reported in the Illinois Comprehensive Automated Immunization Registry Exchange (I-CARE) and Illinois National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (I-NEDSS).\r\n\r\nOutcomes:\r\n\u2022\tCases: People with a positive molecular (PCR) or antigen COVID-19 test result from an FDA-authorized COVID-19 test that was reported into I-NEDSS. A person can become re-infected with SARS-CoV-2 over time and so may be counted more than once in this dataset. Cases are counted by week the test specimen was collected.\r\n\u2022\tHospitalizations: COVID-19 cases who are hospitalized due to a documented COVID-19 related illness or who are admitted for any reason within 14 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Hospitalizations are counted by week of hospital admission.\r\n\u2022\tDeaths: COVID-19 cases who died from COVID-19-related health complications as determined by vital records or a public health investigation. Deaths are counted by week of death.\r\n\r\nVaccination status:\r\n\u2022\tFully vaccinated: Completion of primary series of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine at least 14 days prior to a positive test (with no other positive tests in the previous 45 days).\r\n\u2022\tBoosted: Fully vaccinated with an additional or booster dose of any FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine received at least 14 days prior to a positive test (with no other positive tests in the previous 45 days).\r\n\u2022\tUnvaccinated: No evidence of having received a dose of an FDA-authorized or approved vaccine prior to a positive test. \r\n\r\nCLARIFYING NOTE: Those who started but did not complete all recommended doses of an FDA-authorized or approved vaccine prior to a positive test (i.e., partially vaccinated) are excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nIncidence rates for fully vaccinated but not boosted people (Vaccinated columns) are calculated as total fully vaccinated but not boosted with outcome divided by cumulative fully vaccinated but not boosted at the end of each week. Incidence rates for boosted (Boosted columns) are calculated as total boosted with outcome divided by cumulative boosted at the end of each week. Incidence rates for unvaccinated (Unvaccinated columns) are calculated as total unvaccinated with outcome divided by total population minus cumulative boosted, fully, and partially vaccinated at the end of each week. All rates are multiplied by 100,000. \r\n\r\nIncidence rate ratios (IRRs) are calculated by dividing the weekly incidence rates among unvaccinated people by those among fully vaccinated but not boosted and boosted people. \r\n\r\nOverall age-adjusted incidence rates and IRRs are standardized using the 2000 U.S. Census standard population.\r\n\r\nPopulation totals are from U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 1-year estimates for 2019. \r\n\r\nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received and it is, in fact, very common for recent dates to be incomplete and to be updated as time goes on.

Your first contact should be your health care provider, including your primary care provider, health clinic, or hospital where you have gotten medical care in the past. Check your provider\u2019s website, electronic application (e.g., MyChart), or office recorded message for details on vaccine availability. Providers are also reaching out directly to schedule appointments with their existing patients, prioritizing those who are older with more underlying conditions. Check the details associated with each provider prior to calling or showing up at the office or pharmacy.\n\nThere is a phased roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccine in Chicago with a very limited supply, so certain groups are prioritized.

The most recent estimates for each segment are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/n4j6-wkkf.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.

{"resource": {"name": "311 Service Requests - Pot Holes Reported - Historical", "id": "7as2-ds3y", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "As described in http://bit.ly/311HistoricalPost, the function of this dataset was replaced by https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/v6vf-nfxy. This dataset is historical-only.\n\nThe Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) oversees the patching of potholes on over 4,000 miles of arterial and residential streets in Chicago. CDOT receives reports of potholes through the 311 call center and uses a computerized mapping and tracking system to identify pothole locations and efficiently schedule crews.  One call to 311 can generate multiple pothole repairs. When a crew arrives to repair a 311 pothole, it fills all the other potholes within the block.  Pothole repairs are generally completed within 7 days from the first report of a pothole to 311. Weather conditions, particularly frigid temps and precipitation, influence how long a repair takes.  On days when weather is cooperative and there is no precipitation, crews can fill several thousand potholes.  \n\nIf a previous request is already open for a buffer of 4 addresses the request is given the status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".  For example, if there is an existing CSR for 6535 N Western and a new request is received for 6531 N Western (which is within four addresses of the original CSR) then the new request is given a status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".\n\nOnce the street is repaired, the status in CSR will read \u201cCompleted\u201d for the original request and \"Duplicate (Closed)\" for any duplicate requests.  A service request also receives the status of \u201cCompleted\u201d when the reported address is inspected but no potholes are found or have already been filled.  If another issue is found with the street, such as a \u201ccave-in\u201d or \u201cfailed utility cut\u201d, then it is directed to the appropriate department or contractor. \n\nData Owner: Transportation.

Data are shown as is from the electronic crash reporting system (E-Crash) at CPD, excluding any personally identifiable information. Records are added to the data portal when a crash report is finalized or when amendments are made to an existing report in E-Crash. Data from E-Crash are available for some police districts in 2015, but citywide data are not available until September 2017. About half of all crash reports, mostly minor crashes, are self-reported at the police district by the driver(s) involved and the other half are recorded at the scene by the police officer responding to the crash. Many of the crash parameters, including street condition data, weather condition, and posted speed limits, are recorded by the reporting officer based on best available information at the time, but many of these may disagree with posted information or other assessments on road conditions. If any new or updated information on a crash is received, the reporting officer may amend the crash report at a later time. A traffic crash within the city limits for which CPD is not the responding police agency, typically crashes on interstate highways, freeway ramps, and on local roads along the City boundary, are excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nAll crashes are recorded as per the format specified in the Traffic Crash Report, SR1050, of the Illinois Department of Transportation. The crash data published on the Chicago data portal mostly follows the data elements in SR1050 form.

Estimates are made during flu season, which goes from MMWR week 40 to week 20 of the following year.\r\n\r\nThe risk level is based on observed level of Influenza-Like Illness (ILI).

Level 1 corresponds to an ILI percentage below the mean, level 2 to an ILI percentage less than one standard deviation (SD) above the mean, level 3 to an ILI percentage more than one, but less than two SDs above mean, and so on, with level 10 corresponding to an ILI percentage more than eight SDs above the mean.\r\n\r\nFor more information on ESSENCE, which compiles the estimates, see https://www.dph.illinois.gov/data-statistics/syndromic-surveillance\r\n\r\nAll data are provisional and subject to change.

A consent decree is a written settlement resolving a legal dispute. The OAG/City of Chicago consent decree includes detailed requirements organized into 11 core areas (e.g., use of force, accountability and transparency), collectively designed to create organizational change within CPD. To review the consent decree and learn more about the process, see the City of Chicago\u2019s police reform webpage: \n\nhttps://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/police-reform/home/consent-decree.html\n\nThis dataset is made available to the public pursuant to consent decree requirements described in Paragraph 79 and Paragraph 80. \n\nParagraph 79 of the consent decree states that:\nBy April 1, 2020, and every year thereafter, CPD will conduct an assessment of the relative frequency of all misdemeanor arrests and administrative notices of violation (\u201cANOVs\u201d) effectuated by CPD members of persons in specific demographic categories, including race and gender.  \n\nThen, the last sentence of Paragraph 80 states that: \nUpon completion of the assessment, CPD will publish the underlying data, excluding personal identifying information (e.g., name, address, contact information), via a publicly-accessible, web-based data platform. \n\nThis dataset was used by CPD analysts to create an assessment report pursuant to Paragraph 79. The report was designed to achieve compliance with Paragraph 79. Each record in the dataset shows information about an ANOV issued by a CPD member. An ANOV is a citation issued for violating a Municipal Code of Chicago ordinance. ANOV\u2019s are adjudicated by the City of Chicago Department of Administrative Hearings (DOAH). ANOV data are owned and housed by the Department of Administrative Hearings. CPD receives a daily data extraction from the DOAH data system, whereupon ANOV data is ingested into the CPD data system.\n\nTo request the aforementioned report contact the CPD Freedom of Information Act Section at https://home.chicagopolice.org/information/freedom-of-information-act-foia.. \n\nNOV NUMBER is the record identifier for the dataset.

Source data comes from the CPD Automated Arrest application. This electronic application is part of the CPD CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system, and is used to process arrests Department-wide.\n\nA more-detailed version of this dataset is available to media by request. To make a request, please email <a href=\"mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org?subject=Arrests Access Request\">dataportal@cityofchicago.org</a> with the subject line: <b>Arrests Access Request</b>. Access will require an account on this site, which you may create at https://data.cityofchicago.org/signup. New data fields may be added to this public dataset in the future. Requests for individual arrest reports or any other related data other than access to the more-detailed dataset should be directed to <a href=\"https://home.chicagopolice.org/services/adult-arrest-search/\">CPD</a>, through contact information on that site or a <a href=\"http://www.chicago.gov/foia\">Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)</a> request.\n\nThe data is limited to adult arrests, defined as any arrest where the arrestee was 18 years of age or older on the date of arrest. The data excludes arrest records expunged by CPD pursuant to the Illinois Criminal Identification Act (20 ILCS 2630/5.2). \n\nDepartment members use charges that appear in Illinois Compiled Statutes or Municipal Code of Chicago. Arrestees may be charged with multiple offenses from these sources. Each record in the dataset includes up to four charges, ordered by severity and with CHARGE1 as the most severe charge. Severity is defined based on charge class and charge type, criteria that are routinely used by Illinois court systems to determine penalties for conviction. In case of a tie, charges are presented in the order that the arresting officer listed the charges on the arrest report. By policy, Department members are provided general instructions to emphasize seriousness of the offense when ordering charges on an arrest report. \n\nEach record has an additional set of columns where a charge characteristic (statute, description, type, or class) for all four charges, or fewer if there were not four charges, is concatenated with the | character. These columns can be used with the Filter function's \"Contains\" operator to find all records where a value appears, without having to search four separate columns.\n\nUsers interested in learning more about CPD arrest processes can review current directives, using the CPD Automated Directives system (http://directives.chicagopolice.org/directives/).

{"resource": {"name": "COVID-19 Daily Rolling Average Case, Death, and Hospitalization Rates", "id": "e68t-c7fv", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This is the place to look for important information about how to use this dataset, so please expand this box and read on!\r\n\r\nThis is the source data for some of the metrics available at https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid-19/home/latest-data.html.\r\n\r\nFor all datasets related to COVID-19, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?limitTo=datasets&sortBy=alpha&tags=covid-19.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is a companion to the COVID-19 Daily Cases and Deaths dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/naz8-j4nc). The major difference in this dataset is that the case, death, and hospitalization corresponding rates per 100,000 population are not those for the single date indicated. They are rolling averages for the seven-day period ending on that date. This rolling average is used to account for fluctuations that may occur in the data, such as fewer cases being reported on weekends, and small numbers.  The intent is to give a more representative view of the ongoing COVID-19 experience, less affected by what is essentially noise in the data.\r\n\r\nAll rates are per 100,000 population in the indicated group, or Chicago, as a whole, for \u201cTotal\u201d columns.\r\n\r\nOnly Chicago residents are included based on the home address as provided by the medical provider.\r\n\r\nCases with a positive molecular (PCR) or antigen test are included in this dataset. Cases are counted based on the date the test specimen was collected. Deaths among cases are aggregated by day of death. Hospitalizations are reported by date of first hospital admission. Demographic data are based on what is reported by medical providers or collected by CDPH during follow-up investigation.\r\n\r\nDenominators are from the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 1-year estimate for 2018 and can be seen in the Citywide, 2018 row of the Chicago Population Counts dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/85cm-7uqa).\r\n\r\nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received and it is, in fact, very common for recent dates to be incomplete and to be updated as time goes on.

Newer records are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/sxs8-h27x. The most recent estimates for each region are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t2qc-9pjd.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.

A list of reporting hospitals is included below. All data represent hospital status as of 11:59 pm for that calendar day. Counts include Chicago residents and non-residents.\r\n\r\nICU bed counts include both adult and pediatric ICU beds. Neonatal ICU beds are not included. Capacity refers to all staffed adult and pediatric ICU beds. Availability refers to all available/vacant adult and pediatric ICU beds. Hospitals began reporting COVID-19 confirmed and suspected (PUI) cases in ICU on 03/19/2020. Hospitals began reporting ICU surge capacity as part of total capacity on 5/18/2020.\r\n\r\nAcute non-ICU bed counts include burn unit, emergency department, medical/surgery (ward), other, pediatrics (pediatric ward) and psychiatry beds. Burn beds include those approved by the American Burn Association or self-designated. Capacity refers to all staffed acute non-ICU beds. An additional 500 acute/non-ICU beds were added at McCormick Place on 4/15/2020. These beds are not included in the total capacity count. The McCormick Place Treatment Facility closed on 05/08/2020. Availability refers to all available/vacant acute non-ICU beds. Hospitals began reporting COVID-19 confirmed and suspected (PUI) cases in acute non-ICU beds on 04/03/2020.\r\n\r\nVentilator counts prior to 04/24/2020 include all full-functioning mechanical ventilators, with BiPAP, anesthesia machines and portable/transport ventilators counted as surge. Beginning 04/24/2020, ventilator counts include all full-functioning mechanical ventilators, BiPAP, anesthesia machines and portable/transport ventilators. Ventilators are counted regardless of ability to staff. Hospitals began reporting COVID-19 confirmed and suspected (PUI) cases on ventilator on 03/19/2020. CDPH has access to additional ventilators from the EAMC (Emergency Asset Management Center) cache. These ventilators are included in the total capacity count.\r\n\r\nAll data are provisional and subject to change.

As of 2016, this list includes all commercial, institutional, and residential buildings larger than 50,000 square feet. The information in this dataset should be used by building owners / managers or other building representatives to determine if your property needs to comply by the annual deadline of June 1st. This data can also be used to look up your property's unique 6-digit Chicago Energy Benchmarking ID, which is required for compliance. (The ID is also included the notification letters sent by the City.)\r\n\r\nThe Energy Benchmarking Ordinance calls on existing municipal, commercial, and residential buildings larger than 50,000 square feet to track whole-building energy use, report to the City annually, and verify data accuracy every three years. The law, which phases in from 2014-2017, covers less than 1% of Chicago\u2019s buildings, which account for approximately 20% of total energy used by all buildings. For more details, including ordinance text, rules and regulations, and timing, please visit www.CityofChicago.org/EnergyBenchmarking.\r\n\r\nNote that the ordinance authorizes the City to make individual building data readily-available to the public, beginning with the second year in which a building is covered. The Covered Buildings List is distinct from the publicly-shared energy use data, and does not include energy use or any other information reported in the benchmarking process. For the building-specific energy use dataset, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/xq83-jr8c.\r\n\r\nIf your property is on this list, and you do not believe you are covered by the ordinance, please submit the appropriate online exemption form at: www.CityofChicago.org/EnergyBenchmarking. If your property is not on the list, and it meets the compliance criteria, please check for any alternative building addresses. If the building is still not found, please submit the Building ID Request Form (http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/iframe/Benchmarking_ID_Request.html).

{"resource": {"name": "Violence Reduction - Victim Demographics - Aggregated", "id": "gj7a-742p", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This dataset contains aggregate data on violent index victimizations at the quarter level of each year (i.e., January \u2013 March, April \u2013 June, July \u2013 September, October \u2013 December), from 2001 to the present (1991 to present for Homicides), with a focus on those related to gun violence. Index crimes are 10 crime types selected by the FBI (codes 1-4) for special focus due to their seriousness and frequency. This dataset includes only those index crimes that involve bodily harm or the threat of bodily harm and are reported to the Chicago Police Department (CPD). Each row is aggregated up to victimization type, age group, sex, race, and whether the victimization was domestic-related. Aggregating at the quarter level provides large enough blocks of incidents to protect anonymity while allowing the end user to observe inter-year and intra-year variation. Any row where there were fewer than three incidents during a given quarter has been deleted to help prevent re-identification of victims. For example, if there were three domestic criminal sexual assaults during January to March 2020, all victims associated with those incidents have been removed from this dataset. Human trafficking victimizations have been aggregated separately due to the extremely small number of victimizations.\n\nThis dataset includes a \" GUNSHOT_INJURY_I \" column to indicate whether the victimization involved a shooting, showing either Yes (\"Y\"), No (\"N\"), or Unknown (\"UKNOWN.\") For homicides, injury descriptions are available dating back to 1991, so the \"shooting\" column will read either \"Y\" or \"N\" to indicate whether the homicide was a fatal shooting or not. For non-fatal shootings, data is only available as of 2010. As a result, for any non-fatal shootings that occurred from 2010 to the present, the shooting column will read as \u201cY.\u201d Non-fatal shooting victims will not be included in this dataset prior to 2010; they will be included in the authorized dataset, but with \"UNKNOWN\" in the shooting column.\n\nThe dataset is refreshed daily, but excludes the most recent complete day to allow CPD time to gather the best available information. Each time the dataset is refreshed, records can change as CPD learns more about each victimization, especially those victimizations that are most recent. The data on the Mayor's Office Violence Reduction Dashboard is updated daily with an approximately 48-hour lag. As cases are passed from the initial reporting officer to the investigating detectives, some recorded data about incidents and victimizations may change once additional information arises. Regularly updated datasets on the City's public portal may change to reflect new or corrected information.\n\nHow does this dataset classify victims?\n\nThe methodology by which this dataset classifies victims of violent crime differs by victimization type:\n\nHomicide and non-fatal shooting victims: A victimization is considered a homicide victimization or non-fatal shooting victimization depending on its presence in CPD's homicide victims data table or its shooting victims data table. A victimization is considered a homicide only if it is present in CPD's homicide data table, while a victimization is considered a non-fatal shooting only if it is present in CPD's shooting data tables and absent from CPD's homicide data table. \n\nTo determine the IUCR code of homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, we defer to the incident IUCR code available in CPD's Crimes, 2001-present dataset (available on the City's open data portal). If the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes dataset is inconsistent with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization, we defer to CPD's Victims dataset. \n\nFor a criminal homicide, the only sensible IUCR codes are 0110 (first-degree murder) or 0130 (second-degree murder). For a non-fatal shooting, a sensible IUCR code must signify a criminal sexual assault, a robbery, or, most commonly, an aggravated battery.

{"resource": {"name": "Violence Reduction - Victims of Homicides and Non-Fatal Shootings", "id": "gumc-mgzr", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This dataset contains individual-level homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, including homicide data from 1991 to the present, and non-fatal shooting data from 2010 to the present (2010 is the earliest available year for shooting data). This dataset includes a \"GUNSHOT_INJURY_I \" column to indicate whether the victimization involved a shooting, showing either Yes (\"Y\"), No (\"N\"), or Unknown (\"UKNOWN.\") For homicides, injury descriptions are available dating back to 1991, so the \"shooting\" column will read either \"Y\" or \"N\" to indicate whether the homicide was a fatal shooting or not. For non-fatal shootings, data is only available as of 2010. As a result, for any non-fatal shootings that occurred from 2010 to the present, the shooting column will read as \u201cY.\u201d Non-fatal shooting victims will not be included in this dataset prior to 2010; they will be included in the authorized-access dataset, but with \"UNKNOWN\" in the shooting column.\n\nEach row represents a single victimization, i.e., a unique event when an individual became the victim of a homicide or non-fatal shooting. Each row does not represent a unique victim\u2014if someone is victimized multiple times there will be multiple rows for each of those distinct events. \n\nThe dataset is refreshed daily, but excludes the most recent complete day to allow the Chicago Police Department (CPD) time to gather the best available information. Each time the dataset is refreshed, records can change as CPD learns more about each victimization, especially those victimizations that are most recent. The data on the Mayor's Office Violence Reduction Dashboard is updated daily with an approximately 48-hour lag. As cases are passed from the initial reporting officer to the investigating detectives, some recorded data about incidents and victimizations may change once additional information arises. Regularly updated datasets on the City's public portal may change to reflect new or corrected information.\n\nA version of this dataset with additional crime types is available by request. To make a request, please email <a href=\"mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org?subject=Violence Reduction Victims Access Request\">dataportal@cityofchicago.org</a> with the subject line: <b>Violence Reduction Victims Access Request</b>. Access will require an account on this site, which you may create at https://data.cityofchicago.org/signup.\n\nHow does this dataset classify victims?\n\nThe methodology by which this dataset classifies victims of violent crime differs by victimization type:\n\nHomicide and non-fatal shooting victims: A victimization is considered a homicide victimization or non-fatal shooting victimization depending on its presence in CPD's homicide victims data table or its shooting victims data table. A victimization is considered a homicide only if it is present in CPD's homicide data table, while a victimization is considered a non-fatal shooting only if it is present in CPD's shooting data tables and absent from CPD's homicide data table.\n\nTo determine the IUCR code of homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, we defer to the incident IUCR code available in CPD's Crimes, 2001-present dataset (available on the City's open data portal). If the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes dataset is inconsistent with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization, we defer to CPD's Victims dataset. \nFor a criminal homicide, the only sensible IUCR codes are 0110 (first-degree murder) or 0130 (second-degree murder).

{"resource": {"name": "Traffic Crashes - Vision Zero Chicago Traffic Fatalities", "id": "gzaz-isa6", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Traffic fatalities within the City of Chicago that are included in Vision Zero Chicago (VZC) statistics. Vision Zero is Chicago\u2019s commitment to eliminating fatalities and serious injuries from traffic crashes. The VZC Traffic Fatality List is compiled by the City\u2019s multi-departmental Fatal Crash Response Coordination Committee (FCRCC) that reviews fatal traffic crashes provided by Chicago Police Department\u2019s Major Accident Investigation Unit (MAIU). The dataset is updated after the FCRCC meetings in the 4th week of the month. Thus, the fatality list for a particular month will be available in the dataset after the 4th week of the following month. \n\nThis committee uses a standardized process \u2013 sometimes differing from other sources and everyday use of the term -- to determine whether a death is a \u201ctraffic fatality\u201d for VZC purposes. Therefore, the traffic fatalities included in this list may differ from the fatal crashes reported in the full Traffic Crashes dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/85ca-t3if).\n\nOfficial traffic crash data are published by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) on a yearly basis. The traffic fatality list determined on an ongoing basis through the year may differ from IDOT\u2019s official crash data for Chicago as IDOT may define the cause and location differently from the FCRCC. Once IDOT publishes its data for a year, crashes in this dataset for that year are edited to match IDOT\u2019s determinations, unless the FCRCC disagrees with the IDOT determination \u2013 which happens only rarely and usually due to an interpretation of one of the criteria below.\n\nVZC Traffic Fatalities can be linked with other traffic crash datasets using the \u201cRD_NO\u201d or \u201cPerson_ID\u201d fields.\n\nThe FCRCC defines a \u201ctraffic fatality\u201d for the purpose of VZC statistics as \"any death caused by a traffic crash, within 30 days of the crash\u201d and \u201cinvolves a motor vehicle.\u201d Fatalities that meet the VZC definition of a traffic fatality are included in this dataset unless excluded by the criteria below. There may be records in this dataset that do not appear as fatalities in the other datasets.\n\nThe following criteria exclude a death from being considered a \"traffic fatality\" for VZC purposes:\n\n1. The Medical Examiner determined that the primary cause of the fatality was not the traffic crash, including:\n\na. The fatality was reported as a suicide based on a police investigation.\n\nb. The fatality was reported as a homicide in which the \"party at fault\" intentionally inflicted serious bodily harm that caused the victim's death.\n\nc. The fatality was caused directly and exclusively by a medical condition or where the fatality was not attributable to road user movement on a public roadway. (Note: If a person driving suffers a medical emergency and consequently hit and kills another road user, the other road user is included although the driver suffering a medical emergency is excluded.)\n\n2. The crash did not occur within the public right-of-way.\n\n3. The crash involved a train or such mode of transport within their dedicated right-of-way.\n\n4. The fatality was on a roadway not under Chicago Police Department jurisdiction, including:\n\na. The fatality was occurred on an expressway. The City of Chicago does not have oversight on the expressway system. However, a fatality on expressway ramps occurring within the City jurisdiction will be counted in Vision Zero Chicago Traffic Fatalities.\n\nb. The fatality occurred outside City limits. Crashes on streets along the City boundary may be assigned to another jurisdiction after the investigation if it is determined that the crash started or substantially occurred on the side of the street that is outside the City limits. Jurisdiction of streets along the City boundary are split between City and neighboring jurisdictions along the street center line.\n\n5.

If a Position Control is 1, then employees and vacancies are displayed; if a Position Control is 0, then the total number of hours/months recorded is displayed.\n\nThis dataset follows the format of the equivalent datasets from past years except that Section Code and Division Code have changed from Number to Text in order to accommodate non-numeric values.\n\nFor more information about the budget process, visit the Budget Documents page: http://j.mp/lPotWf.", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/obm.html", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2018-10-17T15:49:16.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-10-02T17:14:41.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-10-17T15:49:16.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2018-10-15T22:34:19.000Z", "columns_name": ["SECTION DESCRIPTION", "BARGAINING UNIT", "TITLE CODE", "TITLE DESCRIPTION", "TOTAL BUDGETED UNIT", "TOTAL BUDGETED AMOUNT", "FUND CODE", "BUDGETED UNIT", "DEPARTMENT DESCRIPTION", "SCHEDULE / GRADE", "FUND TYPE", "DEPARTMENT CODE", "SUB-SECTION DESCRIPTION", "DIVISION CODE", "SUBSECTION CODE", "ORGANIZATION CODE", "POSITION CONTROL", "SECTION CODE", "DIVISION DESCRIPTION", "BUDGETED PAY RATE", "ORGANIZATION DESCRIPTION", "FUND DESCRIPTION"], "columns_field_name": ["section_description", "bargaining_unit", "title_code", "title_description", "total_budgeted_unit", "total_budgeted_amount", "fund_code", "budgeted_unit", "department_description", "schedule_grade", "fund_type", "department_code", "sub_section_description", "division_code", "subsection_code", "organization_code", "position_control", "section_code", "division_description", "budgeted_pay_rate", "organization_description", "fund_description"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{"align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "currency", "currencyStyle": "USD", "precision": "2", "align": "right"}, {"align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {"align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "currency", "currencyStyle": "USD", "precision": "2", "align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-10-15T22:38:09.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["finance", "politics", "economy"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Administration & Finance", "domain_tags": ["2019", "budget"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Metadata_Frequency", "value": "Data are updated annually"}, {"key": "Metadata_Data-Owner", "value": "Budget & Management"}, {"key": "Metadata_Time-Period", "value": "2019"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.cityofchicago.org", "license": "See Terms of Use"}, "permalink": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/ifyy-6nb9", "link": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/Administration-Finance/Budget-2019-Budget-Recommendations-Positions-and-S/ifyy-6nb9", "owner": {"id": "vewm-vupz", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Jonathan Levy"}, "creator": {"id": "vewm-vupz", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Jonathan Levy"}}

Older records are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/emtn-qqdi. The most recent estimates for each segment are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t2qc-9pjd.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.

For a more detailed description, go to: http://bit.ly/Q9AZAD. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (nonfreeway\r\nstreets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every ten minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimate by traffic segments gives the observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic.\r\n\r\nTraffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area).\r\nThis dataset contains the current estimated speed for about 1250 segments covering 300 miles of arterial roads.\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent\r\nintersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates\r\ntogether may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "http://www.chicagotraffictracker.com/", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-03-16T14:19:22.000Z", "createdAt": "2011-11-20T03:28:25.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-01-23T23:06:39.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-03-16T14:19:22.000Z", "columns_name": [" END_LATITUDE", "START_LONGITUDE", " STREET_HEADING", " COMMENTS", " START_LATITUDE", "END_LONGITUDE", "DIRECTION", "SEGMENTID", "FROM_STREET", "STREET", " LAST_UPDATED", "LENGTH", " CURRENT_SPEED", "TO_STREET"], "columns_field_name": ["_lit_lat", "start_lon", "_strheading", "_comments", "_lif_lat", "_lit_lon", "_direction", "segmentid", "_fromst", "street", "_last_updt", "_length", "_traffic", "_tost"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "The longitude associated with the starting point of the segment in the direction of traffic flow.

The dataset has also been renamed. See the text below and http://dev.cityofchicago.org/open%20data/data%20portal/2021/06/23/covid-ed-visits-change.html for specifics. -- This is the place to look for important information about how to use this dataset, so please expand this box and read on!\n\nThis is the source data for some of the metrics available at https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid-19/home/reopening-chicago.html#reopeningmetrics.\n\nFor all datasets related to COVID-19, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?limitTo=datasets&sortBy=alpha&tags=covid-19.\n\nThe National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP), a collaboration among CDC, federal partners, local and state health departments, and academic and private sector partners, is used to capture information during an Emergency Department (ED) visit.  ED data can include information that are collected before cases are diagnosed or laboratory results are confirmed, providing an early warning system for infections, like COVID-19. \n\nThis dataset includes reports of COVID-19-Like illness (CLI) and COVID-19 diagnosed during an ED visit. CLI is defined as fever and cough or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing with or without the presence of a coronavirus diagnosis code. Visits meeting the CLI definition that also have mention of flu or influenza are excluded. \n\nThis dataset also includes ED visits among persons who have been diagnosed or laboratory confirmed to have COVID-19. During the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic COVID-19 diagnoses counts are artificially low, due to varying eligibility requirements and availability of testing.\n\nOver the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, public health best practices migrated from focusing on CLI to focusing on diagnosed cases. This dataset originally contained only CLI columns. In June 2021, the diagnosis columns were added, back filled to the start of the pandemic but with the caveat noted above. Roughly simultaneously, updating of the CLI columns was discontinued, although previously existing data were kept. Reflecting the new columns, the name of the dataset was changed from \u201cCOVID-Like Illness (CLI) Emergency Department Visits\u201d to \u201cCOVID-Like Illness (CLI) and COVID-19 Diagnosis Emergency Department Visits\u201d at the same time.\n\nData Source: Illinois Hospital Emergency Departments reporting to CDPH through the National Syndromic Surveillance Project (NSSP)", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "https://chicago.gov/coronavirus", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-03-14T14:30:09.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-02-10T21:51:28.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-02-03T17:08:01.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-03-14T14:30:09.000Z", "columns_name": ["Total ED Visits - Daily", "COVID Count - 7 day average", "Total COVID - Daily", "COVID Percent - Daily", "CLI Count - 7 day average", "Date", "COVID Percent - 7 day average", "CLI Percent - 7 day average", "Total CLI - Daily", "CLI Percent - Daily"], "columns_field_name": ["total_ed_visits_daily", "covid_count_7_day_average", "total_covid_daily", "covid_percent_daily", "cli_count_7_day_average", "date", "covid_percent_7_day_average", "cli_percent_7_day_average", "total_cli_daily", "cli_percent_daily"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Total number of ED visits on the date.", "7-day rolling average of COVID-19 diagnosis counts", "Total number of COVID-19 cases diagnosed in EDs on the date", "Percentage of ED visits that are COVID-19 diagnoses", "7-day rolling average of CLI counts", "Date of ED visit", "7-day rolling average of COVID-19 diagnosis percentage", "7-day rolling average of CLI percentage", "Total number of CLI ED visits on the date.", "Percentage of ED visits attributed to CLI"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1", "precision": "1"}, {"precision": "0"}, {"view": "date"}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1", "precision": "1"}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1", "precision": "1"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1", "precision": "1"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2021-06-23T17:38:08.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Health & Human Services", "domain_tags": ["covid-19", "health", "link to article present", "public health", "syndromic surveillance"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Metadata_Frequency", "value": "Data are updated daily."}, {"key": "Metadata_Data-Owner", "value": "Department of Public Health"}, {"key": "Metadata_Time-Period", "value": "Current through most recent date shown."}, {"key": "Metadata_Changes-and-Other-Historical-Information-Useful-to-Understanding-This-Dataset", "value": "http://dev.cityofchicago.org/open%20data/data%20portal/2021/06/23/covid-ed-visits-change.html"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.cityofchicago.org", "license": "See Terms of Use"}, "permalink": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/qwib-edaw", "link": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/COVID-Like-Illness-CLI-and-COVID-19-Diagnosis-Emer/qwib-edaw", "owner": {"id": "scy9-9wg4", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "cocadmin"}, "creator": {"id": "scy9-9wg4", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "cocadmin"}}

Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials.\r\n\r\nCongestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period.

Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic.

However, a pedestrian is a \u201cunit\u201d by itself and have a one to one relationship between the Vehicle and Person table.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Police Department reports crashes on IL Traffic Crash Reporting form SR1050.

(See City Council Meeting schedule: https://chicago.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx.)

Segments are commonly categorized as being either \u201cStandard\u201d or \u201cBuffer\u201d: Standard means that signs exist on the street segment beginning at the low-point and ending at the high-point; Buffer means that physical signs do not exist for that zone on that physical street, but residents of addresses within that segment shall have the privilege to purchase zone products (daily permits and annual passes) for that zone, as if physical signs were installed.  (In this way, segments designated as \u2018Buffer\u2019 can in fact overlap with either other buffers and/or standard segments.)

Vulnerability is defined as a combination of sociodemographic factors, epidemiological factors\u200b, occupational factors\u200b, and cumulative COVID-19 burden. \n\nThe 10 components of the index include COVID-19 specific risk factors and outcomes and social factors known to be associated with social vulnerability in the context of emergency preparedness. The CCVI is derived from ranking values of the components by Chicago Community Area, then synthesizing them into a single composite weighted score.  The higher the score, the more vulnerable the geographic area.\n\nZIP Code CCVI is included to enable comparison with other COVID-19 data available on the Chicago Data Portal. Some elements of the CCVI are not available by ZIP Code. To create ZIP Code CCVI, the proportion of the ZIP Code population contributed by each Community Areas was determined. The apportioned populations were then weighted by the Community Area CCVI score and averaged to determine a ZIP Code CCVI score. \n\nThe COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI) is adapted and modified from a Surgo Ventures collaboration (https://precisionforcovid.org/ccvi) and the CDC Social Vulnerability Index\u200b. ZIP Codes are based on ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) developed by the U.S. Census Bureau.

If a ZIP was missing or was not valid, it is displayed as \"Unknown\". \r\n \r\nCases with a positive molecular (PCR) or antigen test are included in this dataset. Cases are counted based on the week the test specimen was collected. For privacy reasons, until a ZIP Code reaches five cumulative cases, both the weekly and cumulative case counts will be blank. Therefore, summing the \u201cCases - Weekly\u201d column is not a reliable way to determine case totals. Deaths are those that have occurred among cases based on the week of death.\r\n \r\nFor tests, each test is counted once, based on the week the test specimen was collected. Tests performed prior to 3/1/2020 are not included. Test counts include multiple tests for the same person (a change made on 10/29/2020). PCR and antigen tests reported to Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) through electronic lab reporting are included. Electronic lab reporting has taken time to onboard and testing availability has shifted over time, so these counts are likely an underestimate of community infection.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cPercent Tested Positive\u201d columns are calculated by dividing the number of positive tests by the number of total tests . Because of the data limitations for the Tests columns, such as persons being tested multiple times as a requirement for employment, these percentages may vary in either direction from the actual disease prevalence in the ZIP Code. \r\n \r\nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received. \r\n\r\nTo compare ZIP Codes to Chicago Community Areas, please see http://data.cmap.illinois.gov/opendata/uploads/CKAN/NONCENSUS/ADMINISTRATIVE_POLITICAL_BOUNDARIES/CCAzip.pdf.

For example, for the range address 1000-1005 S Wabash Ave, the Mapped Location would be the coordinates for 1000 S Wabash Ave. \n DOCKET NO:  This the unique identifier assigned to the case. A docket number can contain multiple tickets. \nTICKET NO: This is the unique identifier of the issued ticket. A ticket can contain up to two code violations. NOTE that the Department of Environment Ticket No.\u2019s may refer to non-unique violations.\nRESPONDENT: The name of the entity issued the code violation notice.  \nCASE TYPE: The Case Types are historic 3-Day Notice, Air Pollution Defect Notice, Administrative Hearing, Summary Abatement, Chicago Storage Tank NOV, State Administrative Citation, State Violation Notice, historic Pre Enforcement Conference, and historic Ticket-Municipal Prosecution.\t\nVIOLATION DATE: The date of the code violation.  \nCODE VIOLATION: This refers to the municipal or state code violation being cited in the ticket. \nDISPOSITION: The outcome of the code violation. \nCASE STATUS: This refers to the final or most current status of the case.   \nFINE AMOUNT: This is the total fine assessed for the case not including court fees. Note that for the Historic Department of Environment data,  this value is not unique to the record but applies to the entire case. For example, the case with a Docket No of 07DE000171 has two records with a fine amount of $350 in each record. The total fine on the case is $350, not the sum of $700.\nCOMMENT: Additional information relating to the violation or case. \nDATA SOURCE: The city department that collected the data.", "attribution": "Chicago Department of Public Health", "attribution_link": "http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdph.html", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-03-15T11:45:45.000Z", "createdAt": "2012-09-24T13:53:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-03-15T11:45:45.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-03-15T11:44:59.000Z", "columns_name": ["LOCATION", "LONGITUDE", "LATITUDE", "VIOLATION DATE", "DATA SOURCE", "CODE VIOLATION", "DISPOSITION", "STREET NAME", "STREET TYPE", "DOCKET NO.", "Boundaries - ZIP Codes", "Community Areas", "Zip Codes", "Census Tracts", "Wards", "ADDRESS", "STREET NUMBER FROM", "TICKET NO.", "RESPONDENT", "CASE STATUS", "FINE AMOUNT", "CASE TYPE", "STREET NUMBER TO", "DIRECTION", "COMMENT"], "columns_field_name": ["location", "longitude", "latitude", "violation_date", "data_source", "code_violation", "disposition", "street_name", "street_type", "case_id", ":@computed_region_rpca_8um6", ":@computed_region_vrxf_vc4k", ":@computed_region_6mkv_f3dw", ":@computed_region_bdys_3d7i", ":@computed_region_43wa_7qmu", "address", "street_number", "ticket_no", "respondent", "case_status", "fine_amount", "case_type", "street_number_to", "direction", "comment"], "columns_datatype": ["Point", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "The date of the code violation.
