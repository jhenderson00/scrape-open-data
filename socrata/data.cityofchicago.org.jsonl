Data are shown as is from the electronic crash reporting system (E-Crash) at CPD, excluding any personally identifiable information. Records are added to the data portal when a crash report is finalized or when amendments are made to an existing report in E-Crash. Data from E-Crash are available for some police districts in 2015, but citywide data are not available until September 2017. About half of all crash reports, mostly minor crashes, are self-reported at the police district by the driver(s) involved and the other half are recorded at the scene by the police officer responding to the crash. Many of the crash parameters, including street condition data, weather condition, and posted speed limits, are recorded by the reporting officer based on best available information at the time, but many of these may disagree with posted information or other assessments on road conditions. If any new or updated information on a crash is received, the reporting officer may amend the crash report at a later time. A traffic crash within the city limits for which CPD is not the responding police agency, typically crashes on interstate highways, freeway ramps, and on local roads along the City boundary, are excluded from this dataset.\r\n\r\nAll crashes are recorded as per the format specified in the Traffic Crash Report, SR1050, of the Illinois Department of Transportation.

{"resource": {"name": "Contracts", "id": "rsxa-ify5", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Contracts and modifications awarded by the City of Chicago since 1993. This data is currently maintained in the City\u2019s Financial Management and Purchasing System (FMPS), which is used throughout the City for contract management and payment. \r\nLegacy System Records: Purchase Order/Contract Numbers that begin with alpha characters identify records imported from legacy systems. Records with a null value in the Contract Type field were imported from legacy systems. \r\n\"Comptroller-Other\" Contract Type: Some records where the Contract Type is \"COMPTROLLER-OTHER\" are ordinance-based agreements and may have start dates earlier than 1993. \r\nDepends Upon Requirements Contracts: If the contract Award Amount is $0, the contract is not cancelled, and the contract is a blanket contract, then the contract award total Depends Upon Requirements. A Depends Upon Requirements contract is an indefinite quantities contract in which the City places orders as needed and the vendor is not guaranteed any particular contract award amount. \r\n\r\nBlanket vs. Standard Contracts: Only blanket contracts (contracts for repeated purchases) have FMPS end dates.

If a ZIP was missing or was not valid, it is displayed as \"Unknown\". \r\n \r\nCases with a positive molecular (PCR) or antigen test are included in this dataset. Cases are counted based on the week the test specimen was collected. For privacy reasons, until a ZIP Code reaches five cumulative cases, both the weekly and cumulative case counts will be blank. Therefore, summing the \u201cCases - Weekly\u201d column is not a reliable way to determine case totals. Deaths are those that have occurred among cases based on the week of death.\r\n \r\nFor tests, each test is counted once, based on the week the test specimen was collected. Tests performed prior to 3/1/2020 are not included. Test counts include multiple tests for the same person (a change made on 10/29/2020). PCR and antigen tests reported to Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) through electronic lab reporting are included. Electronic lab reporting has taken time to onboard and testing availability has shifted over time, so these counts are likely an underestimate of community infection.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cPercent Tested Positive\u201d columns are calculated by dividing the number of positive tests by the number of total tests . Because of the data limitations for the Tests columns, such as persons being tested multiple times as a requirement for employment, these percentages may vary in either direction from the actual disease prevalence in the ZIP Code. \r\n \r\nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received. \r\n\r\nTo compare ZIP Codes to Chicago Community Areas, please see http://data.cmap.illinois.gov/opendata/uploads/CKAN/NONCENSUS/ADMINISTRATIVE_POLITICAL_BOUNDARIES/CCAzip.pdf.

This dataset is historical-only.\n\nThe Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) oversees the patching of potholes on over 4,000 miles of arterial and residential streets in Chicago. CDOT receives reports of potholes through the 311 call center and uses a computerized mapping and tracking system to identify pothole locations and efficiently schedule crews.  One call to 311 can generate multiple pothole repairs. When a crew arrives to repair a 311 pothole, it fills all the other potholes within the block.  Pothole repairs are generally completed within 7 days from the first report of a pothole to 311. Weather conditions, particularly frigid temps and precipitation, influence how long a repair takes.  On days when weather is cooperative and there is no precipitation, crews can fill several thousand potholes.  \n\nIf a previous request is already open for a buffer of 4 addresses the request is given the status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".  For example, if there is an existing CSR for 6535 N Western and a new request is received for 6531 N Western (which is within four addresses of the original CSR) then the new request is given a status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".\n\nOnce the street is repaired, the status in CSR will read \u201cCompleted\u201d for the original request and \"Duplicate (Closed)\" for any duplicate requests.  A service request also receives the status of \u201cCompleted\u201d when the reported address is inspected but no potholes are found or have already been filled.  If another issue is found with the street, such as a \u201ccave-in\u201d or \u201cfailed utility cut\u201d, then it is directed to the appropriate department or contractor. \n\nData Owner: Transportation.

For a more detailed description, go to: http://bit.ly/Q9AZAD. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (nonfreeway\r\nstreets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every ten minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimate by traffic segments gives the observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic.\r\n\r\nTraffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area).\r\nThis dataset contains the current estimated speed for about 1250 segments covering 300 miles of arterial roads.\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent\r\nintersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates\r\ntogether may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "http://www.chicagotraffictracker.com/", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-02-09T02:33:15.000Z", "createdAt": "2011-11-20T03:28:25.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-01-23T23:06:39.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-09T02:33:15.000Z", "columns_name": ["DIRECTION", " LAST_UPDATED", " STREET_HEADING", " COMMENTS", "LENGTH", "FROM_STREET", " START_LATITUDE", " CURRENT_SPEED", "TO_STREET", "STREET", "END_LONGITUDE", "SEGMENTID", "START_LONGITUDE", " END_LATITUDE"], "columns_field_name": ["_direction", "_last_updt", "_strheading", "_comments", "_length", "_fromst", "_lif_lat", "_traffic", "_tost", "street", "_lit_lon", "segmentid", "start_lon", "_lit_lat"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Traffic flow direction for the segment.", "", "The position of the segment in the address grid.

For a detailed description, go to: http://bitly.com/TeqrNv. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). \r\n\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes.

Access will require an account on this site, which you may create at https://data.cityofchicago.org/signup. New data fields may be added to this public dataset in the future.

The data excludes arrest records expunged by CPD pursuant to the Illinois Criminal Identification Act (20 ILCS 2630/5.2). \n\nDepartment members use charges that appear in Illinois Compiled Statutes or Municipal Code of Chicago. Arrestees may be charged with multiple offenses from these sources. Each record in the dataset includes up to four charges, ordered by severity and with CHARGE1 as the most severe charge. Severity is defined based on charge class and charge type, criteria that are routinely used by Illinois court systems to determine penalties for conviction. In case of a tie, charges are presented in the order that the arresting officer listed the charges on the arrest report. By policy, Department members are provided general instructions to emphasize seriousness of the offense when ordering charges on an arrest report. \n\nEach record has an additional set of columns where a charge characteristic (statute, description, type, or class) for all four charges, or fewer if there were not four charges, is concatenated with the | character. These columns can be used with the Filter function's \"Contains\" operator to find all records where a value appears, without having to search four separate columns.\n\nUsers interested in learning more about CPD arrest processes can review current directives, using the CPD Automated Directives system (http://directives.chicagopolice.org/directives/).

Each mode of transportation involved in a crash is a \u201cunit\u201d and get one entry here. Each vehicle, each pedestrian, each motorcyclist, and each bicyclist is considered an independent unit that can have a trajectory separate from the other units. However, people inside a vehicle including the driver do not have a trajectory separate from the vehicle in which they are travelling and hence only the vehicle they are travelling in get any entry here. This type of identification of \u201cunits\u201d is needed to determine how each movement affected the crash. Data for occupants who do not make up an independent unit, typically drivers and passengers, are available in the People table. Many of the fields are coded to denote the type and location of damage on the vehicle. Vehicle information can be linked back to Crash data using the \u201cCRASH_RECORD_ID\u201d field.

The most recent estimates for each segment are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/n4j6-wkkf.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials.\r\n\r\nCongestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nThe segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "https://www.cityofchicago.org", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-02-09T02:35:43.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-02-28T22:28:52.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2021-07-16T20:46:35.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-09T02:35:43.000Z", "columns_name": ["SEGMENT_ID", "STREET", "END_LOCATION", "START_LONGITUDE", "SPEED", "DAY_OF_WEEK", "STREET_HEADING", "START_LOCATION", "BUS_COUNT", "DIRECTION", "MONTH", "MESSAGE_COUNT", "FROM_STREET", "Wards", "Zip Codes", "Community Areas", "END_LATITUDE", "START_LATITUDE", "HOUR", "TO_STREET", "LENGTH", "TIME", "END_LONGITUDE", "COMMENTS", "RECORD_ID"], "columns_field_name": ["segment_id", "street", "end_location", "start_longitude", "speed", "day_of_week", "street_heading", "start_location", "bus_count", "direction", "month", "message_count", "from_street", ":@computed_region_43wa_7qmu", ":@computed_region_6mkv_f3dw", ":@computed_region_vrxf_vc4k", "end_latitude", "start_latitude", "hour", "to_street", "length", "time", "end_longitude", "comments", "record_id"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Point", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Point", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Unique arbitrary number to represent each segment.", "Street name of the traffic segment.", "Location of the end of the segment.", "Longitude of the start of the segment.", "Estimated traffic speed in miles per hour.

Older records are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/emtn-qqdi. The most recent estimates for each segment are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t2qc-9pjd.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.

(See City Council Meeting schedule: https://chicago.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx.)  The collection of street segments for a single zone (collectively identified by Zone number) are not required to constitute a seamless polygon; however, they must be contiguous; in this sense, \u201cZones\u201d often closer resemble a collection of intersecting segments rather than an unbroken area. Segments are commonly categorized as being either \u201cStandard\u201d or \u201cBuffer\u201d: Standard means that signs exist on the street segment beginning at the low-point and ending at the high-point; Buffer means that physical signs do not exist for that zone on that physical street, but residents of addresses within that segment shall have the privilege to purchase zone products (daily permits and annual passes) for that zone, as if physical signs were installed.

{"resource": {"name": "Violence Reduction - Victims of Homicides and Non-Fatal Shootings", "id": "gumc-mgzr", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This dataset contains individual-level homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, including homicide data from 1991 to the present, and non-fatal shooting data from 2010 to the present (2010 is the earliest available year for shooting data). This dataset includes a \"GUNSHOT_INJURY_I \" column to indicate whether the victimization involved a shooting, showing either Yes (\"Y\"), No (\"N\"), or Unknown (\"UKNOWN.\") For homicides, injury descriptions are available dating back to 1991, so the \"shooting\" column will read either \"Y\" or \"N\" to indicate whether the homicide was a fatal shooting or not. For non-fatal shootings, data is only available as of 2010. As a result, for any non-fatal shootings that occurred from 2010 to the present, the shooting column will read as \u201cY.\u201d Non-fatal shooting victims will not be included in this dataset prior to 2010; they will be included in the authorized-access dataset, but with \"UNKNOWN\" in the shooting column.\n\nEach row represents a single victimization, i.e., a unique event when an individual became the victim of a homicide or non-fatal shooting. Each row does not represent a unique victim\u2014if someone is victimized multiple times there will be multiple rows for each of those distinct events. \n\nThe dataset is refreshed daily, but excludes the most recent complete day to allow the Chicago Police Department (CPD) time to gather the best available information. Each time the dataset is refreshed, records can change as CPD learns more about each victimization, especially those victimizations that are most recent. The data on the Mayor's Office Violence Reduction Dashboard is updated daily with an approximately 48-hour lag. As cases are passed from the initial reporting officer to the investigating detectives, some recorded data about incidents and victimizations may change once additional information arises. Regularly updated datasets on the City's public portal may change to reflect new or corrected information.\n\nA version of this dataset with additional crime types is available by request. To make a request, please email <a href=\"mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org?subject=Violence Reduction Victims Access Request\">dataportal@cityofchicago.org</a> with the subject line: <b>Violence Reduction Victims Access Request</b>. Access will require an account on this site, which you may create at https://data.cityofchicago.org/signup.\n\nHow does this dataset classify victims?\n\nThe methodology by which this dataset classifies victims of violent crime differs by victimization type:\n\nHomicide and non-fatal shooting victims: A victimization is considered a homicide victimization or non-fatal shooting victimization depending on its presence in CPD's homicide victims data table or its shooting victims data table. A victimization is considered a homicide only if it is present in CPD's homicide data table, while a victimization is considered a non-fatal shooting only if it is present in CPD's shooting data tables and absent from CPD's homicide data table.\n\nTo determine the IUCR code of homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, we defer to the incident IUCR code available in CPD's Crimes, 2001-present dataset (available on the City's open data portal). If the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes dataset is inconsistent with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization, we defer to CPD's Victims dataset. \nFor a criminal homicide, the only sensible IUCR codes are 0110 (first-degree murder) or 0130 (second-degree murder). For a non-fatal shooting, a sensible IUCR code must signify a criminal sexual assault, a robbery, or, most commonly, an aggravated battery. In rare instances, the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes and Victims dataset do not align with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization:\n\n1. In instances where a homicide victimization does not correspond to an IUCR code 0110 or 0130, we set the IUCR code to \"01XX\"  to indicate that the victimization was a homicide but we do not know whether it was a first-degree murder", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "https://www.chicago.gov", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-02-08T13:38:33.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-05-05T20:04:20.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2021-11-18T15:28:17.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-08T13:38:33.000Z", "columns_name": ["COMMUNITY_AREA", "VICTIMIZATION_FBI_DESCR", "GUNSHOT_INJURY_I", "RACE", "VICTIMIZATION_FBI_CD", "DAY_OF_WEEK", "MONTH", "HOMICIDE_VICTIM_FIRST_NAME", "DISTRICT", "VICTIMIZATION_IUCR_CD", "HOUR", "SEX", "DATE", "HOMICIDE_VICTIM_LAST_NAME", "VICTIMIZATION_PRIMARY", "WARD", "INCIDENT_FBI_DESCR", "STATE_SENATE_DISTRICT", "BEAT", "VICTIMIZATION_IUCR_SECONDARY", "INCIDENT_PRIMARY", "STREET_OUTREACH_ORGANIZATION", "INCIDENT_IUCR_SECONDARY", "STATE_HOUSE_DISTRICT", "CASE_NUMBER", "INCIDENT_FBI_CD", "LOCATION_DESCRIPTION", "LOCATION", "INCIDENT_IUCR_CD", "HOMICIDE_VICTIM_MI", "BLOCK", "UNIQUE_ID", "ZIP_CODE", "AGE", "UPDATED", "LATITUDE", "LONGITUDE", "Police Beats", "Community Areas", "Boundaries - ZIP Codes", "Wards", "Police Districts", "AREA"], "columns_field_name": ["community_area", "victimization_fbi_descr", "gunshot_injury_i", "race", "victimization_fbi_cd", "day_of_week", "month", "homicide_victim_first_name", "district", "victimization_iucr_cd", "hour", "sex", "date", "homicide_victim_last_name", "victimization_primary", "ward", "incident_fbi_descr", "state_senate_district", "beat", "victimization_iucr_secondary", "incident_primary", "street_outreach_organization", "incident_iucr_secondary", "state_house_district", "case_number", "incident_fbi_cd", "location_description", "location", "incident_iucr_cd", "homicide_victim_mi", "block", "unique_id", "zip_code", "age", "updated", "latitude", "longitude", ":@computed_region_d3ds_rm58", ":@computed_region_vrxf_vc4k", ":@computed_region_rpca_8um6", ":@computed_region_43wa_7qmu", ":@computed_region_d9mm_jgwp", "area"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Point", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["The community area where the victimization occurred.

The Tank Asset Database contains tank information from CDPH AST and UST permit applications as well as UST records imported from the historic Department of Environment (DOE) database. This dataset also includes AST records from the historic DOE and pre-1992 UST records from the Building Department. \r\nData fields requiring description are detailed below. \r\nMAPPED LOCATION: Contains latitude/longitude coordinates of the site as determined through the Chicago Open Data Portal\u2019s geocoding engine. In instances where the facility address is a range, the lower number (the value in the \u201cStreet Number From\u201d column) is used for geocoding. For example, for the range address 1000-1005 S Wabash Ave, the Mapped Location would be the coordinates for 1000 S Wabash Ave. \r\n TANK TYPE:  Specifies if the asset is an Underground Storage Tank or an Aboveground Storage Tank.  \r\nFACILITY ID: This is the unique identifier of the facility. A UST Facility ID that is seven digits long and begins with the number \u20182\u2019 is a Facility ID assigned by the Office of the State Fire Marshall (OSFM). All other IDs were assigned by the DOE or CDPH based on the facility address.   \r\nOWNER: The owner of record for the tank. For State-regulated USTs, this is the owner registered with the OSFM. \r\nFACILITY NAME: This is the name given to the facility.

If a Position Control is 1, then employees and vacancies are displayed; if a Position Control is 0, then the total number of hours/months recorded is displayed.\n\nThis dataset follows the format of the equivalent datasets from past years except that  Division Code, Section Code, Subsection Code, and Position Control have changed from Number to Text (not all in the same year) in order to accommodate non-numeric values.\n\nFor more information about the budget process, visit the Budget Documents page: http://j.mp/lPotWf.", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "http://www.chicago.gov/budget", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-10-23T14:31:51.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-10-22T22:31:21.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-10-23T14:31:51.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-10-23T14:31:49.000Z", "columns_name": ["SUBSECTION CODE", "DIVISION DESCRIPTION", "ORGANIZATION DESCRIPTION", "DEPARTMENT CODE", "DIVISION CODE", "BUDGETED UNIT", "TITLE DESCRIPTION", "BUDGETED PAY RATE", "POSITION CONTROL", "SECTION CODE", "TOTAL BUDGETED UNIT", "TITLE CODE", "SECTION DESCRIPTION", "DEPARTMENT DESCRIPTION", "SCHEDULE / GRADE", "SUB-SECTION DESCRIPTION", "BARGAINING UNIT", "ORGANIZATION CODE", "TOTAL BUDGETED AMOUNT", "FUND TYPE", "FUND CODE", "FUND DESCRIPTION"], "columns_field_name": ["subsection_code", "division_description", "organization_description", "department_code", "division_code", "budgeted_unit", "title_description", "budgeted_pay_rate", "position_control", "section_code", "total_budgeted_unit", "title_code", "section_description", "department_description", "schedule_grade", "sub_section_description", "bargaining_unit", "organization_code", "total_budgeted_amount", "fund_type", "fund_code", "fund_description"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{"precisionStyle": "standard", "align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {"align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "currency", "currencyStyle": "USD", "precision": "2", "align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "currency", "currencyStyle": "USD", "precision": "2", "align": "right"}, {"align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}, {"align": "left"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-10-23T14:31:51.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Administration & Finance", "domain_tags": ["2020", "budget"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Metadata_Frequency", "value": "Data are updated annually"}, {"key": "Metadata_Data-Owner", "value": "Budget & Management"}, {"key": "Metadata_Time-Period", "value": "2020"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.cityofchicago.org", "license": "See Terms of Use"}, "permalink": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/j6b9-brjc", "link": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/Administration-Finance/Budget-2020-Budget-Recommendations-Positions-and-S/j6b9-brjc", "owner": {"id": "vewm-vupz", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Jonathan Levy"}, "creator": {"id": "vewm-vupz", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Jonathan Levy"}}

{"resource": {"name": "Chicago Traffic Tracker - Historical Congestion Estimates by Region - 2018-Current", "id": "kf7e-cur8", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This dataset contains the historical estimated congestion for the 29 traffic regions, starting in approximately March 2018. Older records are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/emtn-qqdi. The most recent estimates for each segment are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t2qc-9pjd.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves.

For a more detailed description, go to: http://bit.ly/Q9AZAD. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (nonfreeway\r\nstreets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every ten minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimate by traffic segments gives the observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic.\r\n\r\nTraffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area).\r\nThis dataset contains the current estimated speed for about 1250 segments covering 300 miles of arterial roads.\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent\r\nintersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes.

At any given time, this dataset reflects data currently known to CDPH.\r\n\r\nNumbers in this dataset may differ from other public sources due to definitions of COVID-19-related cases, deaths, and hospitalizations, sources used, how cases, deaths and hospitalizations are associated to a specific date, and similar factors.\r\n\r\nData Source: Illinois National Electronic Disease Surveillance System, Cook County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "https://chicago.gov/coronavirus", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-02-08T23:15:12.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-04-24T17:01:23.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-01-25T22:32:15.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-08T23:15:12.000Z", "columns_name": ["Deaths - Age 18-29", "Deaths - Age 30-39", "Deaths - Unknown Gender", "Cases - Age 70-79", "Cases - Unknown Gender", "Cases - Unknown Race/Ethnicity", "Deaths - Age 40-49", "Deaths - Other Race Non-Latinx", "Hospitalizations - Age Unknown", "Hospitalizations - Age 18-29", "Hospitalizations - Unknown Race/Ethnicity", "Hospitalizations - Age 70-79", "Deaths - Age 50-59", "Cases - Age Unknown", "Deaths - Unknown Race/Ethnicity", "Date", "Deaths - Asian Non-Latinx", "Hospitalizations - Unknown Gender", "Cases -  Age 80+", "Cases - Age 18-29", "Cases - Age 60-69", "Cases - Age 40-49", "Cases - Age 30-39", "Cases - Latinx", "Cases - Black Non-Latinx", "Cases - White Non-Latinx", "Deaths - Age 70-79", "Deaths - Age 80+", "Deaths - Female", "Hospitalizations - Age 30-39", "Cases - Male", "Cases - Age 0-17", "Cases - Total", "Deaths - Latinx", "Cases - Other Race Non-Latinx", "Hospitalizations - Age 0-17", "Deaths - Black Non-Latinx", "Hospitalizations - Age 40-49", "Hospitalizations - Age 60-69", "Hospitalizations - Female", "Hospitalizations - Latinx", "Hospitalizations - Black Non-Latinx", "Hospitalizations - White Non-Latinx", "Cases - Age 50-59", "Deaths - Total", "Deaths - Male", "Deaths - White Non-Latinx", "Hospitalizations - Age 80+", "Hospitalizations - Asian Non-Latinx", "Cases - Female", "Hospitalizations - Male", "Deaths - Age 60-69", "Deaths - Age Unknown", "Deaths - Age 0-17", "Hospitalizations - Other Race Non-Latinx", "Hospitalizations - Age 50-59", "Hospitalizations - Total", "Cases - Asian Non-Latinx"], "columns_field_name": ["deaths_18_29_yrs", "deaths_30_39_yrs", "deaths_unknown_gender", "cases_age_70_79", "cases_unknown_gender", "cases_unknown_race_eth", "deaths_40_49_yrs", "deaths_other_non_latinx", "hospitalizations_age_unknown", "hospitalizations_age_18_29", "hospitalizations_unknown_race_ethnicity", "hospitalizations_age_70_79", "deaths_50_59_yrs", "cases_age_unknown", "deaths_unknown_race_eth", "lab_report_date", "deaths_asian_non_latinx", "hospitalizations_unknown_gender", "cases_age_80_", "cases_age_18_29", "cases_age_60_69", "cases_age_40_49", "cases_age_30_39", "cases_latinx", "cases_black_non_latinx", "cases_white_non_latinx", "deaths_70_79_yrs", "deaths_80_yrs", "deaths_female", "hospitalizations_age_30_39", "cases_male", "cases_age_0_17", "cases_total", "deaths_latinx", "cases_other_non_latinx", "hospitalizations_age_0_17", "deaths_black_non_latinx", "hospitalizations_age_40_49", "hospitalizations_age_60_69", "hospitalizations_female", "hospitalizations_latinx", "hospitalizations_black_non_latinx", "hospitalizations_white_non_latinx", "cases_age_50_59", "deaths_total", "deaths_male", "deaths_white_non_latinx", "hospitalizations_age_80_", "hospitalizations_asian_non_latinx", "cases_female", "hospitalizations_male", "deaths_60_69_yrs", "deaths_unknown_age", "deaths_0_17_yrs", "hospitalizations_other_race_non_latinx", "hospitalizations_age_50_59", "hospitalizations_total", "cases_asian_non_latinx"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "Case or death date.

The dataset has also been renamed. See the text below and http://dev.cityofchicago.org/open%20data/data%20portal/2021/06/23/covid-ed-visits-change.html for specifics. -- This is the place to look for important information about how to use this dataset, so please expand this box and read on!\n\nThis is the source data for some of the metrics available at https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid-19/home/reopening-chicago.html#reopeningmetrics.\n\nFor all datasets related to COVID-19, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?limitTo=datasets&sortBy=alpha&tags=covid-19.\n\nThe National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP), a collaboration among CDC, federal partners, local and state health departments, and academic and private sector partners, is used to capture information during an Emergency Department (ED) visit.  ED data can include information that are collected before cases are diagnosed or laboratory results are confirmed, providing an early warning system for infections, like COVID-19. \n\nThis dataset includes reports of COVID-19-Like illness (CLI) and COVID-19 diagnosed during an ED visit. CLI is defined as fever and cough or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing with or without the presence of a coronavirus diagnosis code. Visits meeting the CLI definition that also have mention of flu or influenza are excluded. \n\nThis dataset also includes ED visits among persons who have been diagnosed or laboratory confirmed to have COVID-19. During the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic COVID-19 diagnoses counts are artificially low, due to varying eligibility requirements and availability of testing.\n\nOver the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, public health best practices migrated from focusing on CLI to focusing on diagnosed cases.

Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). \r\n\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-02-09T02:33:36.000Z", "createdAt": "2011-11-20T03:43:27.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-01-13T17:07:49.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-09T02:33:36.000Z", "columns_name": [" CURRENT_SPEED", " EAST", " DESCRIPTION", " WEST", " REGION_ID", " LAST_UPDATED", " SOUTH", "REGION", " NORTH"], "columns_field_name": ["current_speed", "_east", "_description", "_west", "_region_id", "_last_updt", "_south", "region", "_north"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Estimated congestion level.

(See City Council Meeting schedule: https://chicago.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx.)  The collection of street segments for a single zone (collectively identified by Zone number) are not required to constitute a seamless polygon; however, they must be contiguous; in this sense, \u201cZones\u201d often closer resemble a collection of intersecting segments rather than an unbroken area. Segments are commonly categorized as being either \u201cStandard\u201d or \u201cBuffer\u201d: Standard means that signs exist on the street segment beginning at the low-point and ending at the high-point; Buffer means that physical signs do not exist for that zone on that physical street, but residents of addresses within that segment shall have the privilege to purchase zone products (daily permits and annual passes) for that zone, as if physical signs were installed.  (In this way, segments designated as \u2018Buffer\u2019 can in fact overlap with either other buffers and/or standard segments.)  Physical signs will display the zone number and the day/times when the zone restriction is in effect, e.g., \u201cAll Times\u201d / \u201cAnytime\u201d; \u201cMonday through Friday\u201d; \u201c6am \u2013 6pm All Days.\u201d  During restricted days/times, any vehicle parked in the zone which does not display a valid unexpired zone product (either a daily permit or an annual pass printed on the City Vehicle Sticker) is subject to ticketing/enforcement.

If a Position Control is 1, then employees and vacancies are displayed; if a Position Control is 0, then the total number of hours/months recorded is displayed.\n\nFor information on the current city workforce, with names, positions and salaries, visit the \"Current Employee Names, Salaries, and Position Titles\" dataset: https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/xzkq-xp2w.", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "http://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/obm/provdrs/city_budg/svcs/budget_documents.html", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2021-12-06T22:56:36.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-11-02T18:03:30.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2021-12-06T22:56:34.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2021-12-06T22:56:36.000Z", "columns_name": ["BARGAINING UNIT", "TOTAL BUDGETED UNIT", "TITLE DESCRIPTION", "TITLE CODE", "SCHEDULE/GRADE", "SUB-SECTION DESCRIPTION", "SUB-SECTION CODE", "SECTION DESCRIPTION", "BUDGETED UNIT", "POSITION CONTROL", "ORGANIZATION CODE", "DIVISION DESCRIPTION", "DIVISION CODE", "ORGANIZATION DESCRIPTION", "FUND DESCRIPTION", "DEPARTMENT DESCRIPTION", "DEPARTMENT CODE", "FUND TYPE", "FUND CODE", "TOTAL BUDGETED AMOUNT", "BUDGETED PAY RATE", "SECTION CODE"], "columns_field_name": ["bargaining_unit", "total_budgeted_unit", "title_description", "title_code", "schedule_grade", "sub_section_description", "sub_section_code", "section_description", "budgeted_unit", "position_control", "organization_code", "division_description", "division_code", "organization_description", "fund_description", "department_description", "department_code", "fund_type", "fund_code", "total_budgeted_amount", "budgeted_pay_rate", "section_code"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "currency"}, {"precisionStyle": "currency", "precision": "2"}, {}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2021-11-02T18:03:35.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Administration & Finance", "domain_tags": ["2022", "budget"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Metadata_Frequency", "value": "Data are updated annually"}, {"key": "Metadata_Data-Owner", "value": "Budget & Management"}, {"key": "Metadata_Time-Period", "value": "2022"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.cityofchicago.org", "license": "See Terms of Use"}, "permalink": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/v2mx-icwv", "link": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/Administration-Finance/Budget-2022-Budget-Ordinance-Positions-and-Salarie/v2mx-icwv", "owner": {"id": "vewm-vupz", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Jonathan Levy"}, "creator": {"id": "vewm-vupz", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "Jonathan Levy"}}

Vulnerability is defined as a combination of sociodemographic factors, epidemiological factors\u200b, occupational factors\u200b, and cumulative COVID-19 burden. \n\nThe 10 components of the index include COVID-19 specific risk factors and outcomes and social factors known to be associated with social vulnerability in the context of emergency preparedness. The CCVI is derived from ranking values of the components by Chicago Community Area, then synthesizing them into a single composite weighted score.  The higher the score, the more vulnerable the geographic area.\n\nZIP Code CCVI is included to enable comparison with other COVID-19 data available on the Chicago Data Portal. Some elements of the CCVI are not available by ZIP Code. To create ZIP Code CCVI, the proportion of the ZIP Code population contributed by each Community Areas was determined. The apportioned populations were then weighted by the Community Area CCVI score and averaged to determine a ZIP Code CCVI score. \n\nThe COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI) is adapted and modified from a Surgo Ventures collaboration (https://precisionforcovid.org/ccvi) and the CDC Social Vulnerability Index\u200b. ZIP Codes are based on ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) developed by the U.S. Census Bureau.

If a ZIP was missing or was not valid, it is displayed as \"Unknown\". \r\n \r\nCases with a positive molecular (PCR) or antigen test are included in this dataset. Cases are counted based on the week the test specimen was collected. For privacy reasons, until a ZIP Code reaches five cumulative cases, both the weekly and cumulative case counts will be blank. Therefore, summing the \u201cCases - Weekly\u201d column is not a reliable way to determine case totals. Deaths are those that have occurred among cases based on the week of death.\r\n \r\nFor tests, each test is counted once, based on the week the test specimen was collected. Tests performed prior to 3/1/2020 are not included. Test counts include multiple tests for the same person (a change made on 10/29/2020). PCR and antigen tests reported to Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) through electronic lab reporting are included. Electronic lab reporting has taken time to onboard and testing availability has shifted over time, so these counts are likely an underestimate of community infection.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cPercent Tested Positive\u201d columns are calculated by dividing the number of positive tests by the number of total tests . Because of the data limitations for the Tests columns, such as persons being tested multiple times as a requirement for employment, these percentages may vary in either direction from the actual disease prevalence in the ZIP Code. \r\n \r\nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received. \r\n\r\nTo compare ZIP Codes to Chicago Community Areas, please see http://data.cmap.illinois.gov/opendata/uploads/CKAN/NONCENSUS/ADMINISTRATIVE_POLITICAL_BOUNDARIES/CCAzip.pdf.

For example, for the range address 1000-1005 S Wabash Ave, the Mapped Location would be the coordinates for 1000 S Wabash Ave. \n DOCKET NO:  This the unique identifier assigned to the case. A docket number can contain multiple tickets. \nTICKET NO: This is the unique identifier of the issued ticket. A ticket can contain up to two code violations. NOTE that the Department of Environment Ticket No.\u2019s may refer to non-unique violations.\nRESPONDENT: The name of the entity issued the code violation notice.  \nCASE TYPE: The Case Types are historic 3-Day Notice, Air Pollution Defect Notice, Administrative Hearing, Summary Abatement, Chicago Storage Tank NOV, State Administrative Citation, State Violation Notice, historic Pre Enforcement Conference, and historic Ticket-Municipal Prosecution.\t\nVIOLATION DATE: The date of the code violation.  \nCODE VIOLATION: This refers to the municipal or state code violation being cited in the ticket. \nDISPOSITION: The outcome of the code violation. \nCASE STATUS: This refers to the final or most current status of the case.   \nFINE AMOUNT: This is the total fine assessed for the case not including court fees. Note that for the Historic Department of Environment data,  this value is not unique to the record but applies to the entire case. For example, the case with a Docket No of 07DE000171 has two records with a fine amount of $350 in each record. The total fine on the case is $350, not the sum of $700.\nCOMMENT: Additional information relating to the violation or case. \nDATA SOURCE: The city department that collected the data.", "attribution": "Chicago Department of Public Health", "attribution_link": "http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdph.html", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-02-08T12:46:28.000Z", "createdAt": "2012-09-24T13:53:51.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2023-02-08T12:46:28.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-02-08T12:45:47.000Z", "columns_name": ["DIRECTION", "DISPOSITION", "CODE VIOLATION", "VIOLATION DATE", "CASE TYPE", "RESPONDENT", "TICKET NO.", "DOCKET NO.", "LOCATION", "LONGITUDE", "STREET TYPE", "STREET NAME", "STREET NUMBER TO", "STREET NUMBER FROM", "ADDRESS", "Wards", "Census Tracts", "Community Areas", "Zip Codes", "LATITUDE", "COMMENT", "FINE AMOUNT", "Boundaries - ZIP Codes", "DATA SOURCE", "CASE STATUS"], "columns_field_name": ["direction", "disposition", "code_violation", "violation_date", "case_type", "respondent", "ticket_no", "case_id", "location", "longitude", "street_type", "street_name", "street_number_to", "street_number", "address", ":@computed_region_43wa_7qmu", ":@computed_region_bdys_3d7i", ":@computed_region_vrxf_vc4k", ":@computed_region_6mkv_f3dw", "latitude", "comment", "fine_amount", ":@computed_region_rpca_8um6", "data_source", "case_status"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Point", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "The outcome of the individual code violation.
