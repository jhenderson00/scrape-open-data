{"resource": {"name": "Contracts", "id": "rsxa-ify5", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Contracts and modifications awarded by the City of Chicago since 1993. This data is currently maintained in the City\u2019s Financial Management and Purchasing System (FMPS), which is used throughout the City for contract management and payment. \r\nLegacy System Records: Purchase Order/Contract Numbers that begin with alpha characters identify records imported from legacy systems. Records with a null value in the Contract Type field were imported from legacy systems. \r\n\"Comptroller-Other\" Contract Type: Some records where the Contract Type is \"COMPTROLLER-OTHER\" are ordinance-based agreements and may have start dates earlier than 1993. \r\nDepends Upon Requirements Contracts: If the contract Award Amount is $0, the contract is not cancelled, and the contract is a blanket contract, then the contract award total Depends Upon Requirements. A Depends Upon Requirements contract is an indefinite quantities contract in which the City places orders as needed and the vendor is not guaranteed any particular contract award amount. \r\n\r\nBlanket vs. Standard Contracts: Only blanket contracts (contracts for repeated purchases) have FMPS end dates.

If a ZIP was missing or was not valid, it is displayed as \"Unknown\". \r\n \r\nCases with a positive molecular (PCR) or antigen test are included in this dataset. Cases are counted based on the week the test specimen was collected. For privacy reasons, until a ZIP Code reaches five cumulative cases, both the weekly and cumulative case counts will be blank. Therefore, summing the \u201cCases - Weekly\u201d column is not a reliable way to determine case totals. Deaths are those that have occurred among cases based on the week of death.\r\n \r\nFor tests, each test is counted once, based on the week the test specimen was collected. Tests performed prior to 3/1/2020 are not included. Test counts include multiple tests for the same person (a change made on 10/29/2020). PCR and antigen tests reported to Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) through electronic lab reporting are included. Electronic lab reporting has taken time to onboard and testing availability has shifted over time, so these counts are likely an underestimate of community infection.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cPercent Tested Positive\u201d columns are calculated by dividing the number of positive tests by the number of total tests . Because of the data limitations for the Tests columns, such as persons being tested multiple times as a requirement for employment, these percentages may vary in either direction from the actual disease prevalence in the ZIP Code. \r\n \r\nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received. \r\n\r\nTo compare ZIP Codes to Chicago Community Areas, please see http://data.cmap.illinois.gov/opendata/uploads/CKAN/NONCENSUS/ADMINISTRATIVE_POLITICAL_BOUNDARIES/CCAzip.pdf.

For a more detailed description, go to: http://bit.ly/Q9AZAD. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (nonfreeway\r\nstreets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every ten minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimate by traffic segments gives the observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic.\r\n\r\nTraffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region.

However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent\r\nintersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes.

This dataset is historical-only.\n\nThe Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) oversees the patching of potholes on over 4,000 miles of arterial and residential streets in Chicago. CDOT receives reports of potholes through the 311 call center and uses a computerized mapping and tracking system to identify pothole locations and efficiently schedule crews.  One call to 311 can generate multiple pothole repairs. When a crew arrives to repair a 311 pothole, it fills all the other potholes within the block.  Pothole repairs are generally completed within 7 days from the first report of a pothole to 311. Weather conditions, particularly frigid temps and precipitation, influence how long a repair takes.  On days when weather is cooperative and there is no precipitation, crews can fill several thousand potholes.  \n\nIf a previous request is already open for a buffer of 4 addresses the request is given the status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".  For example, if there is an existing CSR for 6535 N Western and a new request is received for 6531 N Western (which is within four addresses of the original CSR) then the new request is given a status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".\n\nOnce the street is repaired, the status in CSR will read \u201cCompleted\u201d for the original request and \"Duplicate (Closed)\" for any duplicate requests.  A service request also receives the status of \u201cCompleted\u201d when the reported address is inspected but no potholes are found or have already been filled.  If another issue is found with the street, such as a \u201ccave-in\u201d or \u201cfailed utility cut\u201d, then it is directed to the appropriate department or contractor. \n\nData Owner: Transportation.

Source data comes from the CPD Automated Arrest application. This electronic application is part of the CPD CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system, and is used to process arrests Department-wide.\n\nA more-detailed version of this dataset is available to media by request. To make a request, please email <a href=\"mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org?subject=Arrests Access Request\">dataportal@cityofchicago.org</a> with the subject line: <b>Arrests Access Request</b>. Access will require an account on this site, which you may create at https://data.cityofchicago.org/signup. New data fields may be added to this public dataset in the future. Requests for individual arrest reports or any other related data other than access to the more-detailed dataset should be directed to <a href=\"https://home.chicagopolice.org/services/adult-arrest-search/\">CPD</a>, through contact information on that site or a <a href=\"http://www.chicago.gov/foia\">Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)</a> request.\n\nThe data is limited to adult arrests, defined as any arrest where the arrestee was 18 years of age or older on the date of arrest. The data excludes arrest records expunged by CPD pursuant to the Illinois Criminal Identification Act (20 ILCS 2630/5.2). \n\nDepartment members use charges that appear in Illinois Compiled Statutes or Municipal Code of Chicago. Arrestees may be charged with multiple offenses from these sources. Each record in the dataset includes up to four charges, ordered by severity and with CHARGE1 as the most severe charge. Severity is defined based on charge class and charge type, criteria that are routinely used by Illinois court systems to determine penalties for conviction. In case of a tie, charges are presented in the order that the arresting officer listed the charges on the arrest report. By policy, Department members are provided general instructions to emphasize seriousness of the offense when ordering charges on an arrest report. \n\nEach record has an additional set of columns where a charge characteristic (statute, description, type, or class) for all four charges, or fewer if there were not four charges, is concatenated with the | character. These columns can be used with the Filter function's \"Contains\" operator to find all records where a value appears, without having to search four separate columns.\n\nUsers interested in learning more about CPD arrest processes can review current directives, using the CPD Automated Directives system (http://directives.chicagopolice.org/directives/).

For a detailed description, go to: http://bitly.com/TeqrNv. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). \r\n\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-04-05T14:18:23.000Z", "createdAt": "2011-11-20T03:43:27.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-01-13T17:07:49.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-04-05T14:18:23.000Z", "columns_name": [" REGION_ID", " CURRENT_SPEED", " DESCRIPTION", "REGION", " SOUTH", " WEST", " NORTH", " EAST", " LAST_UPDATED"], "columns_field_name": ["_region_id", "current_speed", "_description", "region", "_south", "_west", "_north", "_east", "_last_updt"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Unique arbitrary number to represent each region.", "Estimated congestion level.

Each mode of transportation involved in a crash is a \u201cunit\u201d and get one entry here. Each vehicle, each pedestrian, each motorcyclist, and each bicyclist is considered an independent unit that can have a trajectory separate from the other units.

This type of identification of \u201cunits\u201d is needed to determine how each movement affected the crash. Data for occupants who do not make up an independent unit, typically drivers and passengers, are available in the People table. Many of the fields are coded to denote the type and location of damage on the vehicle. Vehicle information can be linked back to Crash data using the \u201cCRASH_RECORD_ID\u201d field.

The most recent estimates for each segment are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/n4j6-wkkf.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials.\r\n\r\nCongestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nThe segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "https://www.cityofchicago.org", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-04-05T14:26:02.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-02-28T22:28:52.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2021-07-16T20:46:35.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-04-05T14:26:02.000Z", "columns_name": ["STREET_HEADING", "END_LONGITUDE", "HOUR", "SEGMENT_ID", "START_LOCATION", "Community Areas", "Zip Codes", "Wards", "DIRECTION", "MONTH", "START_LONGITUDE", "MESSAGE_COUNT", "COMMENTS", "FROM_STREET", "SPEED", "LENGTH", "END_LOCATION", "START_LATITUDE", "DAY_OF_WEEK", "TIME", "STREET", "END_LATITUDE", "RECORD_ID", "BUS_COUNT", "TO_STREET"], "columns_field_name": ["street_heading", "end_longitude", "hour", "segment_id", "start_location", ":@computed_region_vrxf_vc4k", ":@computed_region_6mkv_f3dw", ":@computed_region_43wa_7qmu", "direction", "month", "start_longitude", "message_count", "comments", "from_street", "speed", "length", "end_location", "start_latitude", "day_of_week", "time", "street", "end_latitude", "record_id", "bus_count", "to_street"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Point", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Point", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["The position of the segment in the address grid.

Older records are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/emtn-qqdi. The most recent estimates for each segment are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t2qc-9pjd.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.

{"resource": {"name": "Violence Reduction - Victims of Homicides and Non-Fatal Shootings", "id": "gumc-mgzr", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This dataset contains individual-level homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, including homicide data from 1991 to the present, and non-fatal shooting data from 2010 to the present (2010 is the earliest available year for shooting data). This dataset includes a \"GUNSHOT_INJURY_I \" column to indicate whether the victimization involved a shooting, showing either Yes (\"Y\"), No (\"N\"), or Unknown (\"UKNOWN.\") For homicides, injury descriptions are available dating back to 1991, so the \"shooting\" column will read either \"Y\" or \"N\" to indicate whether the homicide was a fatal shooting or not. For non-fatal shootings, data is only available as of 2010. As a result, for any non-fatal shootings that occurred from 2010 to the present, the shooting column will read as \u201cY.\u201d Non-fatal shooting victims will not be included in this dataset prior to 2010; they will be included in the authorized-access dataset, but with \"UNKNOWN\" in the shooting column.\n\nEach row represents a single victimization, i.e., a unique event when an individual became the victim of a homicide or non-fatal shooting. Each row does not represent a unique victim\u2014if someone is victimized multiple times there will be multiple rows for each of those distinct events. \n\nThe dataset is refreshed daily, but excludes the most recent complete day to allow the Chicago Police Department (CPD) time to gather the best available information. Each time the dataset is refreshed, records can change as CPD learns more about each victimization, especially those victimizations that are most recent. The data on the Mayor's Office Violence Reduction Dashboard is updated daily with an approximately 48-hour lag. As cases are passed from the initial reporting officer to the investigating detectives, some recorded data about incidents and victimizations may change once additional information arises. Regularly updated datasets on the City's public portal may change to reflect new or corrected information.\n\nA version of this dataset with additional crime types is available by request. To make a request, please email <a href=\"mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org?subject=Violence Reduction Victims Access Request\">dataportal@cityofchicago.org</a> with the subject line: <b>Violence Reduction Victims Access Request</b>. Access will require an account on this site, which you may create at https://data.cityofchicago.org/signup.\n\nHow does this dataset classify victims?\n\nThe methodology by which this dataset classifies victims of violent crime differs by victimization type:\n\nHomicide and non-fatal shooting victims: A victimization is considered a homicide victimization or non-fatal shooting victimization depending on its presence in CPD's homicide victims data table or its shooting victims data table. A victimization is considered a homicide only if it is present in CPD's homicide data table, while a victimization is considered a non-fatal shooting only if it is present in CPD's shooting data tables and absent from CPD's homicide data table.\n\nTo determine the IUCR code of homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, we defer to the incident IUCR code available in CPD's Crimes, 2001-present dataset (available on the City's open data portal). If the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes dataset is inconsistent with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization, we defer to CPD's Victims dataset. \nFor a criminal homicide, the only sensible IUCR codes are 0110 (first-degree murder) or 0130 (second-degree murder).

As of 2016, this list includes all commercial, institutional, and residential buildings larger than 50,000 square feet. The information in this dataset should be used by building owners / managers or other building representatives to determine if your property needs to comply by the annual deadline of June 1st. This data can also be used to look up your property's unique 6-digit Chicago Energy Benchmarking ID, which is required for compliance. (The ID is also included the notification letters sent by the City.)\r\n\r\nThe Energy Benchmarking Ordinance calls on existing municipal, commercial, and residential buildings larger than 50,000 square feet to track whole-building energy use, report to the City annually, and verify data accuracy every three years. The law, which phases in from 2014-2017, covers less than 1% of Chicago\u2019s buildings, which account for approximately 20% of total energy used by all buildings. For more details, including ordinance text, rules and regulations, and timing, please visit www.CityofChicago.org/EnergyBenchmarking.\r\n\r\nNote that the ordinance authorizes the City to make individual building data readily-available to the public, beginning with the second year in which a building is covered. The Covered Buildings List is distinct from the publicly-shared energy use data, and does not include energy use or any other information reported in the benchmarking process. For the building-specific energy use dataset, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/xq83-jr8c.\r\n\r\nIf your property is on this list, and you do not believe you are covered by the ordinance, please submit the appropriate online exemption form at: www.CityofChicago.org/EnergyBenchmarking. If your property is not on the list, and it meets the compliance criteria, please check for any alternative building addresses. If the building is still not found, please submit the Building ID Request Form (http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/iframe/Benchmarking_ID_Request.html). The Chicago Energy Benchmarking Help Center can assist with any other questions, and can be reached at (855)858-6878, or by email: Info@ChicagoEnergyBenchmarking.org.\r\n\r\nThis dataset will be refreshed periodically as additional information becomes available.

{"resource": {"name": "Violence Reduction - Victim Demographics - Aggregated", "id": "gj7a-742p", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This dataset contains aggregate data on violent index victimizations at the quarter level of each year (i.e., January \u2013 March, April \u2013 June, July \u2013 September, October \u2013 December), from 2001 to the present (1991 to present for Homicides), with a focus on those related to gun violence. Index crimes are 10 crime types selected by the FBI (codes 1-4) for special focus due to their seriousness and frequency. This dataset includes only those index crimes that involve bodily harm or the threat of bodily harm and are reported to the Chicago Police Department (CPD). Each row is aggregated up to victimization type, age group, sex, race, and whether the victimization was domestic-related. Aggregating at the quarter level provides large enough blocks of incidents to protect anonymity while allowing the end user to observe inter-year and intra-year variation. Any row where there were fewer than three incidents during a given quarter has been deleted to help prevent re-identification of victims. For example, if there were three domestic criminal sexual assaults during January to March 2020, all victims associated with those incidents have been removed from this dataset. Human trafficking victimizations have been aggregated separately due to the extremely small number of victimizations.\n\nThis dataset includes a \" GUNSHOT_INJURY_I \" column to indicate whether the victimization involved a shooting, showing either Yes (\"Y\"), No (\"N\"), or Unknown (\"UKNOWN.\") For homicides, injury descriptions are available dating back to 1991, so the \"shooting\" column will read either \"Y\" or \"N\" to indicate whether the homicide was a fatal shooting or not. For non-fatal shootings, data is only available as of 2010. As a result, for any non-fatal shootings that occurred from 2010 to the present, the shooting column will read as \u201cY.\u201d Non-fatal shooting victims will not be included in this dataset prior to 2010; they will be included in the authorized dataset, but with \"UNKNOWN\" in the shooting column.\n\nThe dataset is refreshed daily, but excludes the most recent complete day to allow CPD time to gather the best available information. Each time the dataset is refreshed, records can change as CPD learns more about each victimization, especially those victimizations that are most recent. The data on the Mayor's Office Violence Reduction Dashboard is updated daily with an approximately 48-hour lag. As cases are passed from the initial reporting officer to the investigating detectives, some recorded data about incidents and victimizations may change once additional information arises. Regularly updated datasets on the City's public portal may change to reflect new or corrected information.\n\nHow does this dataset classify victims?\n\nThe methodology by which this dataset classifies victims of violent crime differs by victimization type:\n\nHomicide and non-fatal shooting victims: A victimization is considered a homicide victimization or non-fatal shooting victimization depending on its presence in CPD's homicide victims data table or its shooting victims data table. A victimization is considered a homicide only if it is present in CPD's homicide data table, while a victimization is considered a non-fatal shooting only if it is present in CPD's shooting data tables and absent from CPD's homicide data table. \n\nTo determine the IUCR code of homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, we defer to the incident IUCR code available in CPD's Crimes, 2001-present dataset (available on the City's open data portal). If the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes dataset is inconsistent with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization, we defer to CPD's Victims dataset. \n\nFor a criminal homicide, the only sensible IUCR codes are 0110 (first-degree murder) or 0130 (second-degree murder). For a non-fatal shooting, a sensible IUCR code must signify a criminal sexual assault, a robbery, or, most commonly, an aggravated battery.

{"resource": {"name": "Violence Reduction - Victims of Homicides and Non-Fatal Shootings", "id": "gumc-mgzr", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This dataset contains individual-level homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, including homicide data from 1991 to the present, and non-fatal shooting data from 2010 to the present (2010 is the earliest available year for shooting data). This dataset includes a \"GUNSHOT_INJURY_I \" column to indicate whether the victimization involved a shooting, showing either Yes (\"Y\"), No (\"N\"), or Unknown (\"UKNOWN.\") For homicides, injury descriptions are available dating back to 1991, so the \"shooting\" column will read either \"Y\" or \"N\" to indicate whether the homicide was a fatal shooting or not. For non-fatal shootings, data is only available as of 2010. As a result, for any non-fatal shootings that occurred from 2010 to the present, the shooting column will read as \u201cY.\u201d Non-fatal shooting victims will not be included in this dataset prior to 2010; they will be included in the authorized-access dataset, but with \"UNKNOWN\" in the shooting column.\n\nEach row represents a single victimization, i.e., a unique event when an individual became the victim of a homicide or non-fatal shooting. Each row does not represent a unique victim\u2014if someone is victimized multiple times there will be multiple rows for each of those distinct events. \n\nThe dataset is refreshed daily, but excludes the most recent complete day to allow the Chicago Police Department (CPD) time to gather the best available information. Each time the dataset is refreshed, records can change as CPD learns more about each victimization, especially those victimizations that are most recent. The data on the Mayor's Office Violence Reduction Dashboard is updated daily with an approximately 48-hour lag. As cases are passed from the initial reporting officer to the investigating detectives, some recorded data about incidents and victimizations may change once additional information arises. Regularly updated datasets on the City's public portal may change to reflect new or corrected information.\n\nA version of this dataset with additional crime types is available by request. To make a request, please email <a href=\"mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org?subject=Violence Reduction Victims Access Request\">dataportal@cityofchicago.org</a> with the subject line: <b>Violence Reduction Victims Access Request</b>. Access will require an account on this site, which you may create at https://data.cityofchicago.org/signup.\n\nHow does this dataset classify victims?\n\nThe methodology by which this dataset classifies victims of violent crime differs by victimization type:\n\nHomicide and non-fatal shooting victims: A victimization is considered a homicide victimization or non-fatal shooting victimization depending on its presence in CPD's homicide victims data table or its shooting victims data table. A victimization is considered a homicide only if it is present in CPD's homicide data table, while a victimization is considered a non-fatal shooting only if it is present in CPD's shooting data tables and absent from CPD's homicide data table.\n\nTo determine the IUCR code of homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, we defer to the incident IUCR code available in CPD's Crimes, 2001-present dataset (available on the City's open data portal). If the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes dataset is inconsistent with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization, we defer to CPD's Victims dataset. \nFor a criminal homicide, the only sensible IUCR codes are 0110 (first-degree murder) or 0130 (second-degree murder). For a non-fatal shooting, a sensible IUCR code must signify a criminal sexual assault, a robbery, or, most commonly, an aggravated battery. In rare instances, the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes and Victims dataset do not align with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization:\n\n1. In instances where a homicide victimization does not correspond to an IUCR code 0110 or 0130, we set the IUCR code to \"01XX\"  to indicate that the victimization was a homicide but we do not know whether it was a first-degree murder", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "https://www.chicago.gov", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-04-05T12:37:40.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-05-05T20:04:20.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2021-11-18T15:28:17.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-04-05T12:37:40.000Z", "columns_name": ["LOCATION", "MONTH", "AGE", "INCIDENT_FBI_CD", "INCIDENT_FBI_DESCR", "SEX", "VICTIMIZATION_IUCR_CD", "DISTRICT", "HOMICIDE_VICTIM_LAST_NAME", "VICTIMIZATION_PRIMARY", "LOCATION_DESCRIPTION", "CASE_NUMBER", "BLOCK", "VICTIMIZATION_IUCR_SECONDARY", "DAY_OF_WEEK", "UPDATED", "LONGITUDE", "VICTIMIZATION_FBI_CD", "RACE", "GUNSHOT_INJURY_I", "VICTIMIZATION_FBI_DESCR", "AREA", "Police Districts", "Wards", "Boundaries - ZIP Codes", "Community Areas", "Police Beats", "ZIP_CODE", "INCIDENT_IUCR_CD", "COMMUNITY_AREA", "INCIDENT_IUCR_SECONDARY", "HOMICIDE_VICTIM_FIRST_NAME", "HOUR", "HOMICIDE_VICTIM_MI", "STREET_OUTREACH_ORGANIZATION", "LATITUDE", "DATE", "INCIDENT_PRIMARY", "BEAT", "STATE_SENATE_DISTRICT", "STATE_HOUSE_DISTRICT", "UNIQUE_ID", "WARD"], "columns_field_name": ["location", "month", "age", "incident_fbi_cd", "incident_fbi_descr", "sex", "victimization_iucr_cd", "district", "homicide_victim_last_name", "victimization_primary", "location_description", "case_number", "block", "victimization_iucr_secondary", "day_of_week", "updated", "longitude", "victimization_fbi_cd", "race", "gunshot_injury_i", "victimization_fbi_descr", "area", ":@computed_region_d9mm_jgwp", ":@computed_region_43wa_7qmu", ":@computed_region_rpca_8um6", ":@computed_region_vrxf_vc4k", ":@computed_region_d3ds_rm58", "zip_code", "incident_iucr_cd", "community_area", "incident_iucr_secondary", "homicide_victim_first_name", "hour", "homicide_victim_mi", "street_outreach_organization", "latitude", "date", "incident_primary", "beat", "state_senate_district", "state_house_district", "unique_id", "ward"], "columns_datatype": ["Point", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Calendar date", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Calendar date", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["A slightly altered location of the victimization in a form that allows for mapping and other geographic analysis on this data portal.", "Month when the victimization occurred.", "Age of the victims grouped by decade.

Vision Zero is Chicago\u2019s commitment to eliminating fatalities and serious injuries from traffic crashes. The VZC Traffic Fatality List is compiled by the City\u2019s multi-departmental Fatal Crash Response Coordination Committee (FCRCC) that reviews fatal traffic crashes provided by Chicago Police Department\u2019s Major Accident Investigation Unit (MAIU). The dataset is updated after the FCRCC meetings in the 4th week of the month. Thus, the fatality list for a particular month will be available in the dataset after the 4th week of the following month. \n\nThis committee uses a standardized process \u2013 sometimes differing from other sources and everyday use of the term -- to determine whether a death is a \u201ctraffic fatality\u201d for VZC purposes. Therefore, the traffic fatalities included in this list may differ from the fatal crashes reported in the full Traffic Crashes dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/85ca-t3if).\n\nOfficial traffic crash data are published by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) on a yearly basis. The traffic fatality list determined on an ongoing basis through the year may differ from IDOT\u2019s official crash data for Chicago as IDOT may define the cause and location differently from the FCRCC. Once IDOT publishes its data for a year, crashes in this dataset for that year are edited to match IDOT\u2019s determinations, unless the FCRCC disagrees with the IDOT determination \u2013 which happens only rarely and usually due to an interpretation of one of the criteria below.\n\nVZC Traffic Fatalities can be linked with other traffic crash datasets using the \u201cRD_NO\u201d or \u201cPerson_ID\u201d fields.\n\nThe FCRCC defines a \u201ctraffic fatality\u201d for the purpose of VZC statistics as \"any death caused by a traffic crash, within 30 days of the crash\u201d and \u201cinvolves a motor vehicle.\u201d Fatalities that meet the VZC definition of a traffic fatality are included in this dataset unless excluded by the criteria below. There may be records in this dataset that do not appear as fatalities in the other datasets.\n\nThe following criteria exclude a death from being considered a \"traffic fatality\" for VZC purposes:\n\n1. The Medical Examiner determined that the primary cause of the fatality was not the traffic crash, including:\n\na. The fatality was reported as a suicide based on a police investigation.\n\nb. The fatality was reported as a homicide in which the \"party at fault\" intentionally inflicted serious bodily harm that caused the victim's death.\n\nc. The fatality was caused directly and exclusively by a medical condition or where the fatality was not attributable to road user movement on a public roadway. (Note: If a person driving suffers a medical emergency and consequently hit and kills another road user, the other road user is included although the driver suffering a medical emergency is excluded.)\n\n2. The crash did not occur within the public right-of-way.\n\n3. The crash involved a train or such mode of transport within their dedicated right-of-way.\n\n4. The fatality was on a roadway not under Chicago Police Department jurisdiction, including:\n\na. The fatality was occurred on an expressway. The City of Chicago does not have oversight on the expressway system. However, a fatality on expressway ramps occurring within the City jurisdiction will be counted in Vision Zero Chicago Traffic Fatalities.\n\nb. The fatality occurred outside City limits. Crashes on streets along the City boundary may be assigned to another jurisdiction after the investigation if it is determined that the crash started or substantially occurred on the side of the street that is outside the City limits.

Older records are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/emtn-qqdi. The most recent estimates for each segment are in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t2qc-9pjd.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.

For a more detailed description, go to: http://bit.ly/Q9AZAD. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (nonfreeway\r\nstreets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every ten minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimate by traffic segments gives the observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic.\r\n\r\nTraffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area).\r\nThis dataset contains the current estimated speed for about 1250 segments covering 300 miles of arterial roads.\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent\r\nintersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates\r\ntogether may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "http://www.chicagotraffictracker.com/", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-04-05T14:18:58.000Z", "createdAt": "2011-11-20T03:28:25.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-01-23T23:06:39.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-04-05T14:18:58.000Z", "columns_name": [" CURRENT_SPEED", " LAST_UPDATED", "STREET", " END_LATITUDE", "TO_STREET", "START_LONGITUDE", "DIRECTION", " START_LATITUDE", "FROM_STREET", "END_LONGITUDE", "SEGMENTID", "LENGTH", " COMMENTS", " STREET_HEADING"], "columns_field_name": ["_traffic", "_last_updt", "street", "_lit_lat", "_tost", "start_lon", "_direction", "_lif_lat", "_fromst", "_lit_lon", "segmentid", "_length", "_comments", "_strheading"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["A value of -1 means no estimate is available.", "", "Street name of the traffic segment.", "", "End street for the segment in the direction of traffic flow.", "The longitude associated with the starting point of the segment in the direction of traffic flow.

The dataset has also been renamed.

ED data can include information that are collected before cases are diagnosed or laboratory results are confirmed, providing an early warning system for infections, like COVID-19. \n\nThis dataset includes reports of COVID-19-Like illness (CLI) and COVID-19 diagnosed during an ED visit. CLI is defined as fever and cough or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing with or without the presence of a coronavirus diagnosis code. Visits meeting the CLI definition that also have mention of flu or influenza are excluded. \n\nThis dataset also includes ED visits among persons who have been diagnosed or laboratory confirmed to have COVID-19. During the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic COVID-19 diagnoses counts are artificially low, due to varying eligibility requirements and availability of testing.\n\nOver the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, public health best practices migrated from focusing on CLI to focusing on diagnosed cases. This dataset originally contained only CLI columns. In June 2021, the diagnosis columns were added, back filled to the start of the pandemic but with the caveat noted above. Roughly simultaneously, updating of the CLI columns was discontinued, although previously existing data were kept. Reflecting the new columns, the name of the dataset was changed from \u201cCOVID-Like Illness (CLI) Emergency Department Visits\u201d to \u201cCOVID-Like Illness (CLI) and COVID-19 Diagnosis Emergency Department Visits\u201d at the same time.\n\nData Source: Illinois Hospital Emergency Departments reporting to CDPH through the National Syndromic Surveillance Project (NSSP)", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "https://chicago.gov/coronavirus", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-04-03T14:30:10.000Z", "createdAt": "2021-02-10T21:51:28.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2022-02-03T17:08:01.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-04-03T14:30:10.000Z", "columns_name": ["Date", "Total ED Visits - Daily", "Total COVID - Daily", "COVID Count - 7 day average", "COVID Percent - 7 day average", "CLI Percent - Daily", "CLI Count - 7 day average", "Total CLI - Daily", "CLI Percent - 7 day average", "COVID Percent - Daily"], "columns_field_name": ["date", "total_ed_visits_daily", "total_covid_daily", "covid_count_7_day_average", "covid_percent_7_day_average", "cli_percent_daily", "cli_count_7_day_average", "total_cli_daily", "cli_percent_7_day_average", "covid_percent_daily"], "columns_datatype": ["Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Date of ED visit", "Total number of ED visits on the date.", "Total number of COVID-19 cases diagnosed in EDs on the date", "7-day rolling average of COVID-19 diagnosis counts", "7-day rolling average of COVID-19 diagnosis percentage", "Percentage of ED visits attributed to CLI", "7-day rolling average of CLI counts", "Total number of CLI ED visits on the date.", "7-day rolling average of CLI percentage", "Percentage of ED visits that are COVID-19 diagnoses"], "columns_format": [{"view": "date"}, {}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1", "precision": "1"}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1", "precision": "1"}, {"precision": "0"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1", "precision": "1"}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1", "precision": "1"}], "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "lens_display_type": "table", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2021-06-23T17:38:08.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Health & Human Services", "domain_tags": ["covid-19", "health", "link to article present", "public health", "syndromic surveillance"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Metadata_Frequency", "value": "Data are updated daily."}, {"key": "Metadata_Data-Owner", "value": "Department of Public Health"}, {"key": "Metadata_Time-Period", "value": "Current through most recent date shown."}, {"key": "Metadata_Changes-and-Other-Historical-Information-Useful-to-Understanding-This-Dataset", "value": "http://dev.cityofchicago.org/open%20data/data%20portal/2021/06/23/covid-ed-visits-change.html"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.cityofchicago.org", "license": "See Terms of Use"}, "permalink": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/qwib-edaw", "link": "https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/COVID-Like-Illness-CLI-and-COVID-19-Diagnosis-Emer/qwib-edaw", "owner": {"id": "scy9-9wg4", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "cocadmin"}, "creator": {"id": "scy9-9wg4", "user_type": "interactive", "display_name": "cocadmin"}}

Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials.\r\n\r\nCongestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nThe segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.", "attribution": "City of Chicago", "attribution_link": "https://www.cityofchicago.org", "contact_email": null, "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2023-04-05T14:26:02.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-02-28T22:28:52.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2021-07-16T20:46:35.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2023-04-05T14:26:02.000Z", "columns_name": ["STREET_HEADING", "END_LONGITUDE", "HOUR", "SEGMENT_ID", "START_LOCATION", "Community Areas", "Zip Codes", "Wards", "DIRECTION", "MONTH", "START_LONGITUDE", "MESSAGE_COUNT", "COMMENTS", "FROM_STREET", "SPEED", "LENGTH", "END_LOCATION", "START_LATITUDE", "DAY_OF_WEEK", "TIME", "STREET", "END_LATITUDE", "RECORD_ID", "BUS_COUNT", "TO_STREET"], "columns_field_name": ["street_heading", "end_longitude", "hour", "segment_id", "start_location", ":@computed_region_vrxf_vc4k", ":@computed_region_6mkv_f3dw", ":@computed_region_43wa_7qmu", "direction", "month", "start_longitude", "message_count", "comments", "from_street", "speed", "length", "end_location", "start_latitude", "day_of_week", "time", "street", "end_latitude", "record_id", "bus_count", "to_street"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Point", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Point", "Number", "Number", "Calendar date", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["The position of the segment in the address grid.

For a detailed description, go to: http://bitly.com/TeqrNv. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago\u2019s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O\u2019Hare airport area). \r\n\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes.

Person data can be linked with the Crash and Vehicle dataset using the \u201cCRASH_RECORD_ID\u201d field. A vehicle can have multiple occupants and hence have a one to many relationship between Vehicle and Person dataset. However, a pedestrian is a \u201cunit\u201d by itself and have a one to one relationship between the Vehicle and Person table.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Police Department reports crashes on IL Traffic Crash Reporting form SR1050.

(See City Council Meeting schedule: https://chicago.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx.)

Segments are commonly categorized as being either \u201cStandard\u201d or \u201cBuffer\u201d: Standard means that signs exist on the street segment beginning at the low-point and ending at the high-point; Buffer means that physical signs do not exist for that zone on that physical street, but residents of addresses within that segment shall have the privilege to purchase zone products (daily permits and annual passes) for that zone, as if physical signs were installed.  (In this way, segments designated as \u2018Buffer\u2019 can in fact overlap with either other buffers and/or standard segments.)

Vulnerability is defined as a combination of sociodemographic factors, epidemiological factors\u200b, occupational factors\u200b, and cumulative COVID-19 burden. \n\nThe 10 components of the index include COVID-19 specific risk factors and outcomes and social factors known to be associated with social vulnerability in the context of emergency preparedness. The CCVI is derived from ranking values of the components by Chicago Community Area, then synthesizing them into a single composite weighted score.  The higher the score, the more vulnerable the geographic area.\n\nZIP Code CCVI is included to enable comparison with other COVID-19 data available on the Chicago Data Portal. Some elements of the CCVI are not available by ZIP Code. To create ZIP Code CCVI, the proportion of the ZIP Code population contributed by each Community Areas was determined. The apportioned populations were then weighted by the Community Area CCVI score and averaged to determine a ZIP Code CCVI score. \n\nThe COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI) is adapted and modified from a Surgo Ventures collaboration (https://precisionforcovid.org/ccvi) and the CDC Social Vulnerability Index\u200b. ZIP Codes are based on ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) developed by the U.S. Census Bureau.

If a ZIP was missing or was not valid, it is displayed as \"Unknown\". \r\n \r\nCases with a positive molecular (PCR) or antigen test are included in this dataset. Cases are counted based on the week the test specimen was collected. For privacy reasons, until a ZIP Code reaches five cumulative cases, both the weekly and cumulative case counts will be blank. Therefore, summing the \u201cCases - Weekly\u201d column is not a reliable way to determine case totals. Deaths are those that have occurred among cases based on the week of death.\r\n \r\nFor tests, each test is counted once, based on the week the test specimen was collected. Tests performed prior to 3/1/2020 are not included. Test counts include multiple tests for the same person (a change made on 10/29/2020). PCR and antigen tests reported to Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) through electronic lab reporting are included. Electronic lab reporting has taken time to onboard and testing availability has shifted over time, so these counts are likely an underestimate of community infection.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cPercent Tested Positive\u201d columns are calculated by dividing the number of positive tests by the number of total tests . Because of the data limitations for the Tests columns, such as persons being tested multiple times as a requirement for employment, these percentages may vary in either direction from the actual disease prevalence in the ZIP Code. \r\n \r\nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received. \r\n\r\nTo compare ZIP Codes to Chicago Community Areas, please see http://data.cmap.illinois.gov/opendata/uploads/CKAN/NONCENSUS/ADMINISTRATIVE_POLITICAL_BOUNDARIES/CCAzip.pdf.
